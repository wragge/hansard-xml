<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not happy to be speaking on this child sex tourism legislation. It is a moment of shame for our nation that we need this kind of legislation. We have all known for years that the child prostitution racket is very widespread in Asia and that it exists in Australia. This legislation is long overdue and I will be pleased to vote for it. My view is a basic, common one: sex is an activity for adults. The coercion of children in this world&mdash;coercion by drugs, force, or poverty&mdash;is against all the mainstream values that Australians hold as sacred. It is fitting that this parliament should respond to the rising tide of objections from our Asian neighbours and use an Australian law to try to curb the gross behaviour of some Australians in Asia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I support this legislation, I am not especially confident that it will be effective on a day-to-day basis. We should not be discouraged by this. We need the law as a backstop. Australians should always know that this law exists and that it will be used. Whilst it may not be perfectly effective, an offending Australian will never be sure whether or not it will suddenly be effective towards him. This fear is a good thing and hopefully will give some benefit to abused children in Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, Australians are not the only offenders. Many of these children are literally sold for cash money by their parents to brothel keepers in the cities. I know that cultural differences exist between Australia and other places, and we must be sensitive to these cultural differences. However, there must be a limit to how far an act can be described as culturally different before it becomes anti-human. I suggest that selling one's children into prostitution is anti-human. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That Australians would exploit this tragedy does great damage to our international standing. We are very quick to sit in judgment on the moral failings of others. It is therefore appropriate that we should give legislative backing to our professed high moral standards. In recent years, the United Nations has taken an ever greater involvement in the question of children's rights. This is to be encouraged. I have served on the national board of UNICEF Australia for the past seven years, and I applaud the work that it has done in regard to the protection of children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the legal basis for this legislation arises out of the external powers provision of the current Australian constitution. The opposition in recent weeks has been attacking these powers in relation to the Tasmania case, yet soon it will vote in support of this bill, thus agreeing to the use of the external powers provision and the UN declarations. Australia would be well served if the opposition could get its act together and decide whether it approves or disapproves of the external powers provision and then act consistently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main provisions of this amendment are quite complicated. As gaol terms of 17 to 14 years are very serious, we need to look carefully at the amendment. The offences being legislated against fall into two categories: those involving children under 12 years of age and those involving minors between 12 and 16 years. In Australian law, absolute precision surrounds these ages. We can achieve such precision because we have birth certificates which are kept accurately and which are available as a public documents. This is not the case to the same degree in Asia. In Australia, to provide a birth certificate that shows that a minor turned 16 the day before the charged offence would see the charge collapse. This level of precision does not operate in Asia. Where a sentence of 14 years is pending, it is a very serious problem. Section 50FA of the amendment bill gives a jury the right to estimate the age of a child where the court is satisfied that there is insufficient evidence to establish the matter otherwise. I think that this section should require a jury to hear an opinion from the court appointed doctor and take that opinion into consideration when deciding on this vital issue of the age of the child in question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The defences that can be brought forward by defendants are basically two: the defendant believed that the child was aged 16 years or older, and the defendant believed that the child consented to the relevant sexual conduct. These defences are reasonable and in line with Australian practice. Indeed it is difficult to see what defences other than these could be allowed. Again I would stress the problem of determining age and consent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A great deal of the child sex business in Asia, as in Australia, is big business and big money. In those circumstances the question of consent becomes very difficult. A way out of this problem may be to simply turn the whole prosecution on determining the age of the child and declaring a child under 16 legally incapable of consenting to any sexual relations outside a valid marriage with any Australian. I note that this bill does not take this option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea of taking evidence by video link from outside Australia is fraught with peril. What is to stop the substitution of a younger child for the actual child who had sexual relations with the Australian defendant? What is to prevent a blackmail attempt by interested parties outside Australia? Perhaps, as Australian embassies are actually Australian territory, it would be better to convene a Federal Court in an Australian embassy on any occasion when this legislation is the basis for a prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that the age of 16 years is used as an age of consent for both males and females outside Australia. This is not the case within Australia. I can see a legal challenge to state age of consent laws when this legislation is passed. Perhaps the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) should attempt to obtain a uniform age across Australia for both males and females. What the age is is the question for negotiation. What is essential is that the age be uniform and applicable to all Australians, male and female, in or out of Australia. It would be most unwise to have convictions overturned on appeal due to conflict within laws. These matters should be ironed out before the laws are used to deal with this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation should become the law of Australia. This parliament should say to Australians that our public norms apply to them no matter where they go. We have a duty to maintain our international reputation. I am fully confident that we are doing the right thing in passing this legislation. It may not always be able to be used but its existence will add a note of fear into the degenerate Australians who molest children in Asia. This fear is a good thing. I am pleased to vote for this bill, and in doing so give some hope and encouragement to those in Asia fighting the good fight on behalf of Asian children. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill because of the concerns of Western countries over the sexual exploitation and abuse by Western nationals of children overseas and in Asian countries in particular. Similar legislation has already been introduced in several European jurisdictions, including Germany, Sweden and Norway. Our obligations to take action are further highlighted as Australia is a party to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was ratified by Australia on 17 December 1990 and came into force in Australia on 16 January 1991. Article 34 of the convention provides:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">States Parties undertake to protect the child from all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse. For these purposes, States Parties shall in particular take all appropriate national, bilateral and multilateral measures to prevent:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A) The inducement or coercion of a child to engage in any unlawful sexual activity;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">B)The exploitative use of children in prostitution or other unlawful sexual practices;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">C)The exploitative use of children in pornographic performances and materials.</PARA>
<PARA>It is my understanding that this bill was presented to the state Attorneys-General in the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General meeting in February 1994 and has their support. Some states and territories are also considering passing supplementary legislation dealing with child sex tourism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is important to our international reputation. It is also important that I support the views expressed by my learned colleague the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) in calling for this bill to be referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Closer scrutiny now will result in better legislation to enforce the law against these ugly Australians who abuse children in other countries. We need to ensure that when this legislation becomes law it will impose a standard of behaviour on Australians visiting other countries in relation to sexual contact involving children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In considering the legal arguments we also should be prepared to look at the same picture as the international community sees when it examines child prostitution in countries like Thailand. We cannot legitimately argue that the problem of child prostitution in Asia is not ours or that the Australian legislation can have no meaningful impact on the situation and, therefore, is futile and pointless. I accept that the primary cause of child prostitution in Asia stems from the problems in the countries in which it exists. Children in Asia become prostitutes because of their poverty. The impoverished guardians of these children may be tricked, but are more usually forced, into delivering them into prostitution. Alternatively, street children become prostitutes by an act of free will. However, I use the term `free will' advisedly since the options available to street kids are probably limited to destitution or prostitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians are not solely responsible for the demand which the impoverished of the Philippines and Thailand in particular are driven to supply. In the bars and on the streets where paedophiles go to buy young children, there can be found a mix of nationalities. Child prostitution in Asia exists to satisfy not only Australians but also Americans, Europeans and other Asians. These are factors which limit the impact we can have on the problem in its entirety but should not deter us from action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at it from a different perspective, perhaps we cannot afford to leave it to other governments to punish those in our community who are creating the demand that is the lifeblood of the child sex industry. The government in Thailand has pledged to end child prostitution but the police seem to have made few inroads. By its very nature prostitution among street kids defies policing, yet even when prostitution is organised through established institutions police have had little permanent impact. It has been suggested that many police are closely bound up with prostitution through bodies and part ownership of establishments that profit from the sex trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the reluctance of the Thai police to pursue child sex customers and profiteers may also be attributed to the ease with which such offenders once arrested can secure their freedom. While Thai offenders can escape a gaol sentence through the payment of a small fee, foreigners can simply call in their embassy and seek deportation. Amongst the customers and the profiteers there is the belief that the sexual exploitation of Asian children carries immunity from the law. At present this belief does not seem entirely unwarranted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both principal and practical realities demand that Australia develop the legislation that will make it a criminal offence for Australians to engage in sexual relations with children overseas or to organise or promote child sex tourism. By ratifying the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, we have committed ourselves to the principle of protecting children from exploitation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thanks to the bravado of those involved, perhaps one of the worst kept secrets in this country is that many Australians travel to Asian countries for the primary purpose of buying sex. Although there are approximately 300,000 Australians visiting Asia each year, it is estimated that only about 200 of these are undertaking sex tours. The media coverage of Australia's paedophiles in Asia has been extensive and damaging, blasting any comfortable perception we may have had of loud but generous Aussies in Asia for a bit of harmless fun. The participation of Australians in the Asian child prostitution industry is anything but harmless; it is destructive, and even when it leaves no physical scars it is no more than an act of violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paul Robinson, writing for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS>, enlightened readers about prostitution in Bangkok. I quote from his article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A non-descript Australian who calls himself Andrew sits on a stool gazing rapturously at rows of young, naked Thai girls dancing at the infamous Hollywood bar in Bangkok.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Andrew, in his late thirties, says he is a Sydneysider . . . "the North Shore".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He is on a sex tour of Thailand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Andrew said he had been in Bangkok for about a week and had already slept with three young girls.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Andrew liked them young, very young.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . leering at a young Thai girl loitering near the entrance of the bar, Andrew drained his Singhai beer, paid the bill and sidled up to the girl.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Soon after he was seen leaving the notorious Nana Plaza girlie bar complex with her.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">She looked no older than 15.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The two walked hand in hand across Sukhumvit road, heading for the anonymous Grace Hotel.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Outside the Hollywood bar Ning, an attractive 17 year old, had just completed her third contract for the night.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rings on all her fingers were jammed with 100 baht ($5) notes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Her eyes were filled with tears and her face was grey with shame.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Her last client was a 45 year old man from Wodonga, on a business trip to Bangkok.</PARA>
<PARA>There are other stories of elderly and middle-aged Australian men procuring boys as young as 13. It is claimed by Mr Robinson that the Victoria Police and Australian Federal Police have closely monitored the activities of travel agencies and more than 15 known paedophiles after the detection of several organised sex tours to Asia. The Victoria Police have successfully infiltrated one travel agency owned by two men whose home is in the northern suburbs of Melbourne. The targeting of travel agencies follows revelations by Philippines authorities that they have banned at least 10 Australians for allegedly molesting Filipino boys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Robinson further claims that an unpublished Victoria Police report on child prostitution in Asia completed about two years ago, which was a joint police-customs operation, has already uncovered a number of prominent Australian male offenders involved in an international boys association. They were travelling to both Thailand and the Philippines for sexual liaisons with boys of the same age who would normally be committed to their care in their organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The demand for prostitutes grows daily as sex tourists to Asia increasingly want sex with children rather than adults, whom they may previously have targeted. This shift of preference is widely attributed to the misguided perception amongst sex consumers that the young are AIDS free, which is surely a rather twisted implementation of the safe sex principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exact number of child prostitutes in Asia is not accurately known, but it is conservatively estimated to be about 200,000. Some argue that it could be 800,000. The prevalence of AIDS amongst young child prostitutes in Asia is extremely high. One organisation which rehabilitates child prostitutes has found that 40 per cent of the children it rescues are HIV positive. Other authorities put this figure at 50 per cent. On the one hand, it is tragic that the lives of these children will be cut short by AIDS. On the other, our population is put at greater risk when Australian paedophiles, sometimes family men who are nearly always sexually active when in Australia, engage in sex with AIDS infected children overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Bangkok, the public health ministry, which has instituted an extensive testing program, estimates that between 200,000 and 400,000 Thais are infected with the AIDS virus. Australian Professor John Dwyer calls Thailand and Burma, the nexus of sex and drug trafficking, the epicentre of the epidemic on the continent. Thailand's projected population growth has already been affected by the epidemic. The Thai Red Cross estimates that, by the year 2000, one-third of all deaths in the country may be caused by AIDS. Meanwhile, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bangkok Post</EMPHASIS> assures visitors, who get free copies of the daily delivered to their hotel rooms, that there is no AIDS or HIV amongst the bar girls in the red light districts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In one of the most explicit official acknowledgments of the connection between the AIDS crisis and international economic relations, Dr Michael Merson, the director of the global program on AIDS of the World Health Organisation, has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it's extremely important that developed nations understand that the focus of this epidemic is going to end up being in Asia and the Pacific. We are all dependent for survival in having this region of the world becoming prosperous.</PARA>
<PARA>There has been a conspiracy of silence in this country and an unwillingness to condemn the exploitation of Asian children in the same way that we condemn the sexual abuse of Australian children. Quite rightly, we are outraged by any adult who seeks his or her pleasure in the sexual exploitation of Australian children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We grieve for the young people when trust in the adults they rely on for protection is betrayed. We use our criminal system to punish those responsible. We should have no lesser response to the betrayal of Asian children. Asian children are no less worthy of protection than Australian children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In terms of self-interest, it is also imperative that such legislation be created. Our material wellbeing is increasingly a function of our relationship with Asia. We prosper to the extent that Asia turns to us for resources, products and services, yet the trade relationship is as subtle and complex as any other relationship. Certainly one buys from the most competitive supplier, but sentiments such as respect and trust also weave themselves into the trade calculation. Australian paedophiles in Asia earn this country contempt. Our economic interdependence with Asia means that this is a luxury we cannot afford. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I have no doubt that enforcing this law, which will evolve from this debate, will not be easy. There will no doubt be some financial costs. Cooperation between state and federal police and governments of other countries will be essential. But the benefits will be significant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the government for taking this initiative and the minister for agreeing with the request of my colleague the honourable member for Tangney that this bill be referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indeed pleased to see the opposition support the passage of the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill 1994 through the House of Representatives and, I hope, through the Senate. In saying that, I draw the attention of the opposition to comments by Senator Kemp last night on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> where, on behalf of the opposition, he attacked the government for its use of the external power and the way that Australia, at a Commonwealth level, increasingly uses its involvement through United Nations treaties and conventions to exercise legislative power. It is strange to be today listening to members of the opposition support the use of the external power after having listened to Senator Kemp last night attack the government for the very legislation that is now passing through this House with great support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation involves the exercise, constitutionally, of the external power. The legislative base upon which the Commonwealth puts the legislation to the House is the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was ratified in Australia on 17 December 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over a large number of years, Australia has entered into a wide variety of international treaties and conventions, including the international labour convention, which was very largely the genesis of the industrial relations legislation brought down in the House that the opposition opposed. So I really think that in many ways the opposition has to get its act together and understand that the Commonwealth today, through the external power in the Australian constitution, now has a much enlarged capacity to pass legislation for the benefit of this country as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The bill before the House raises interesting issues of morality and culture in the very large worldwide industry of prostitution, be it male or female prostitution or adult or child prostitution. It raises questions as to why, for example, when the industry thrives everywhere in the world, countries are still refusing to regulate it. It is a nonsense to suggest that we are going to control the sex industry anywhere in the world by this legislation, by pretending that the industry does not exist or that it can be, in health terms, controlled by keeping it an illegal activity. Prostitution in Thailand is illegal; prostitution with children in Thailand is illegal; and prostitution in Australia is still largely illegal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It raises the very question: is it not time that we recognise, whether we like it or not, that prostitutes have existed in the past, do exist now and will exist in the future? I support fully the comments of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), that health is surely now one of the major concerns about this industry. If we are going to have an effect on that industry, it can only be achieved by recognising this point and imposing some regulatory control over the industry so that those engaged in it, be they adults or children, get health coverage and are taught to use hygienic methods that reduce the health problems associated with their activities. I for one call on all Asian governments, not just the Thailand government, and Australian states to recognise that very simple fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prostitution is the source of great criminality. It is the source of large sums of illegal moneys which pad the activities of international organised criminality. We can control organised criminality only by taking away the source of funds. We know that in the area of drugs. We know also that in the Asian countries, certainly, prostitution and the international drug market are very much interrelated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no secret that many drug couriers are Asian prostitutes who carry the drugs into this country in various orifices of their bodies; for example, packed into condoms. We all know that various numbers of condoms can be inserted into various parts of the body, be they swallowed or anal or vaginal. It is a large source of the importation of illegal drugs into this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that a large number of Australian males who will buy a kilo of No. 4 heroin in Thailand at the cost of $A12,500 will engage the services of prostitutes by paying their fare to import the drug into this country. That one kilo of No. 4 heroin is worth approximately $250,000 once it has landed in Sydney. So it is more than just prostitution that we should be concerned with in this debate; it is the activities of internationally involved organised criminality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I for one would urge all countries, ourself included, to look seriously at the prostitution industries they have and to recognise once and for all that to make such activities illegal is a nonsense and a joke. It is time we gained the degree of maturity required to understand that it will continue to exist in various forms and guises. This legislation, unfortunately, will not stop those activities overseas or in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very few Australian males who have travelled widely in Asia have not been propositioned. Very few Australians that I know who have travelled to Bangkok, for example, have not visited Soi Cowboy or Patpong. Most Australians, male and female, who have visited Thailand are well aware of the tourist nature of the sex industry in Bangkok. It is one of the big selling points of Bangkok. It is no different elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall back in 1975, when I first visited Jakarta, one night an Australian expat who was living there took me to an underpass near the cemetery, where I first saw transvestites&mdash;incredibly beautiful people, I might add. That was one of my early experiences of the sex industry of Asia. I was quite astonished to realise that these were not women but were, genetically, men. I do not know how people tell the difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prostitution is an enormous industry right throughout Asia. Having visited Bangkok on a number of occasions and sat back in the bars of Soi Cowboy and Patpong, I think it really is offensive and I find it sad. I have two daughters who are young adults. I have sat down and watched these young Thai women, naked, dancing in front of me and offering themselves to me. One night the going price was $A20. I cannot help thinking of my own daughters and imagining them in the same position. Frankly, I find the entire industry offensive&mdash;whether it be children or adults, boys or girls. The industry is huge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having come to a friendship with many Thai people and stayed with them in their private homes, I understand that prostitution is very much a part of Thai culture. It is wrong for us today in this House to criticise westerners for going to Thailand for sex tours when the largest sex industry in Thailand is internal Thai sexual relationships. There is not one small town anywhere in Thailand that does not have prostitution available for Thai men. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not profess to understand the nature of the culture in which this practice operates. I have never quite come to grips with the sexual mores of Thailand. They completely baffle me. It is true that I have been invited to attend army messes to receive massages as a gift from the officers there. It obviously is very much a part of the Thai nature and Thai culture. So we should not be sitting here today pretending that by passing this legislation we are going to have any impact whatsoever on the enormous sex industry which exists right throughout South East Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not use Thailand as the only example. I first went to Singapore way back in the early 1970s. We tend to forget that there was a place called Fats and there was Buigis  Street. Back in the 1970s, Buigis Street was the heart of the sex industry in Singapore. Mr Lee can come to Australia and preach to this country about all sorts of political mores, but I do not think Mr Lee has managed to solve his own organised crime problems in Singapore or many of the other similar problems that all countries face. I wish sometimes he would worry about his own place rather than worrying about us. I do not think we need lectures from anyone on morality or on political propriety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess that, as a normal, healthy male, having travelled widely through Asia over a number of years, I have been more than aware of the nature of the sex industry. It really is grotesque to think that young boys and young girls, particularly from the northern parts of Thailand and Burma, are purchased as slaves. We really are talking about a white slave trade. They are taken away from the area which they know. Usually they are quite illiterate and uneducated. They are not even used to the ways of larger cities like Chiang Mai, let alone the megalopolis that is now Bangkok. They are taken to a place where they are sold, primarily to westerners, as virgins for quite enormous sums of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How grotesque can human beings be to each other? We are talking about slavery in the 20th century. I take the view that anything we can do to influence the trade, particularly in the paedophilia area, is desirable. But I am cautious. I do not think that, until there is a will in the countries concerned to take their own actions to regulate their industries and to impose their own controls upon them, this legislation will reduce the sex industry or the availability of young boys and girls for western tourists in those countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that it is not just Australians who are involved. Wandering through the streets of Patpong at night, every language spoken on this planet can be heard. The Japanese are frequent and very wide users of the sex industries in Asia. The Japanese openly advertise in Japan for sex tours. Whilst I think we are going down the right track, there is still much more to be done. I think the United Nations should be congratulated on moving down the track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again I stress the point that it is the countries of source that are going to have to do something about those industries. There are many Thai people who are greatly concerned. But whilst there are such large sums of money available for corruption through the industry, because of its illegality, it is not going to change. We know that in Australia. If we have learnt anything about organised crime, it is the point that I keep stressing: it is the illegal activities that create the profits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Organised crime operates on demand marketplaces. It can survive only on a demand market. Hence, drugs operate on a demand. The industry does not create the demand. The demand already exists. We are a drug taking nation, whether it be valium or any other prescribed drugs. Our biggest problem is not illegal drugs; it is prescribed drugs. There are more people addicted to serepax, rohypnol and valium than there are to heroin. We need to look at that problem rather than to waste a lot of money trying to control the heroin trade. That also applies to the prostitution area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As a traditionally trained English common lawyer, I do have some concern about the nature of the extraterritoriality of the legislation. We are here in Australia saying that an act committed in another territory over which we do not have jurisdiction will be a criminal offence for the purposes of Australian law if committed by an Australian resident or an Australian citizen. That is an extension at common law of the jurisdictional rights of Australian courts. It is a very fundamental and very wide extension. It also raises very big questions about the nature of the evidence which will be required to successfully prosecute such a case in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite properly, we are not going to change the evidentiary burden which would be placed upon any prosecution. Hence, in order to be successful in a prosecution, the prosecutor would first need to establish the age of the victim. That would be the first and the fundamental evidentiary burden placed on the prosecution. Are we then going to pay to bring people from Thailand to Australia to give evidence, or are we going to establish other means whereby the evidence can be taken in Thailand, subject to Australian evidentiary burdens of proof, and then accepted in an Australian court?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Questions arise of whether or not the victims would be willing to be part of such a prosecution process and, if they were willing, whether their lives would be put at further risk. Let us make no mistake about this. Organised criminality does not hold human life very dearly. The people who are involved in organised criminal activities and who use child prostitutes in an Asian country are not going to take very lightly attempts to bring them to justice by using the children as witnesses. So in some senses, understanding the way these things operate, I have some concerns that if we are indeed going to try to use young children from other countries as witnesses in an Australian prosecution we may be placing them at some degree of risk. In that sense, I believe this country is going to need to provide adequate financial assistance to enable the children to structure a life away from criminality and to ensure that their lives are protected in the country where they want to live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All in all, this bill has my support. I think it is indeed a very brave act by this parliament to pass legislation affecting behaviour in a country other than Australia, and I think we should recognise that that is in fact what we are doing. I hope members of the opposition look very seriously at the way the external power is now operating. I make no bones about it: I am a centralist, and the longer I have stayed in this parliament, the more centralist I have become. In fact, the greatest thing this country could ever do is abolish the states and get it over and done with once and for all, because they are nothing but a financial drain on the entire Australian economy, no matter which political party runs them. </PARA>

We will get rid of these stupid embassies on the Strand run by states. When you go to England, no-one knows who runs this country&mdash;New South Wales, Victoria or South Australia. It is really a joke. I am very pleased about the way the external power is starting to operate and the way it is giving the Australian parliament greater ability to act as a national parliament affecting Australia as a whole and to pass laws by just ignoring those things we call the states, which are an anachronism from colonial days.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, I would like to say that I am in strong support of the intent of the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill and certainly in general support of the wording of the bill. In saying that, I recognise there are many technical difficulties associated with the bill, particularly in gathering evidence in other countries and in prosecuting people for acts that are perpetrated overseas. It is estimated that something like five million tourists worldwide visit Asia each year. Something like 300,000 of those come from Australia and, of that number, something like several hundred to several thousand visit centres like Bangkok and Manila to have sex with children, something that the great mass of people in this country do not find acceptable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people partake in acts that, if they were perpetrated in Australia, would lead to prosecution and gaol here. I think these acts on child prostitutes overseas are despicable. They are condemned by something in excess of 99 per cent of the people who live in this country and contribute to harming these children overseas, both mentally and physically. I will have something more to say about that later. The Australians who do this damage our reputation overseas, and the term `ugly Australian' which grew out of the 1950s is now taking on a new and more sinister meaning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been reports that Australians have owned up to one-third of the brothels in the red-light district in Manila at one stage or another. Ron O'Grady&mdash;a New Zealander who is the director of ECPAT, End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism, which is a non-government agency working in 25 countries&mdash;has said that many brothels there have Australian themes. You only have to walk down a street in the Manila district of Ermita to see that every second bar is The Happy Kangaroo, The Jolly Swagman or The Drunken Wombat. Mr O'Grady says that among the worst offenders in these areas are Australian tourists. That is something that this country certainly cannot be proud of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of countries overseas have already introduced legislation or taken measures to ban their citizens from engaging in child prostitution in Asian countries. Amongst these are Germany, France, Norway, Sweden and other Scandinavian countries. Of the five million tourists from countries around the world who visit Asian countries each year, the worst offenders engaging in child prostitution come from Australia, Germany, the United States, Japan and Britain. Some travel agents openly organise sex tours to these countries. Though, unlike the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland), I have never been to any of these particular Asian countries myself, I am told that just to sit in a plane going from Australia to, say, Bangkok and witness the lurid behaviour and expectations of the travellers on that plane, especially amongst those in the 50- to 60-year-old age bracket, can make one ashamed to be an Australian citizen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons why children engage in prostitution are many and complex. They are usually a combination of many things, not the least of which is poverty. Parents often deliberately put their children into these positions or, in some cases, are actually tricked into putting their children in these situations. The parents may be told that the children will be paid big money to act as models or to wash dishes or whatever and find out later that the children end up being child prostitutes. Once trapped in this profession, it is very hard for the children to get out of it until they become too old or clapped out at what we would still consider the tender age of perhaps 20 or 25. Once in this profession, the children are exposed to many detrimental things, not the least of which are things detrimental to their health profile. Something like a quarter to half of the child prostitutes in some countries are HIV positive. As tourists wanting to avoid getting AIDS demand younger and younger children, so the pressure on younger children to become prostitutes escalates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a physical danger to these children. The anal and vaginal tissues of young children tear much more easily than those of adults, and this makes them more prone to infection. In many cases, paediatricians have to sew them up. There have been many horrific cases. One highlighted recently was a case of a 10-year-old Filipina who died after being vaginally abused by a 33-year-old Austrian or German doctor who, after finishing doing what he wanted to do with her with his own body, put an electrical vibrator into her which broke and caused her to bleed. He left her and she ended up dying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The doctor was charged, but I believe he was released afterwards on a number of technicalities, not the least of which was a dispute over her age. I am pleased that in this legislation the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) is looking to overcome the problem of those sorts of technicalities being used by perpetrators of these crimes in order to get off their charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also mental dangers to these children. They feel betrayed by the adults who manipulate them, and in some cases it is their parents. They are exploited by the pimps who take virtually all the money earned by the children who engage in these sexual acts. These pimps force more and more customers on the children. They charge these young girls and boys, in some cases, for food and board. Often these charges end up being more than what the children are being paid for the work that they do; therefore, they are in perpetual debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a combination of poverty and greed on the part of the children and the pimps and the weird sex drives of the tourists who go there that generates this industry. It is estimated that there are at least 100,000 child prostitutes in Thailand under the age of 14 and perhaps 700,000 to one million worldwide. There are probably about one million prostitutes of all ages in Thailand alone. Most of the child prostitutes in Thailand and the Philippines are young girls, although the number of young boys is increasing. I believe that the gender of the child prostitutes in Sri Lanka is predominantly male. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to speak briefly about the perpetrators of these crimes. They tend to be&mdash;although I stress not always&mdash;the worst of society's specimens. They range in age from the relatively young to the quite elderly. A disproportionately high percentage of them are deviants and obnoxious characters who have difficulty fitting in socially in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Asian countries are starting to crack down more on child prostitution, which is a trend I think we would all welcome. When adults who engage in these crimes are caught, there is often a reluctance in these Asian countries to commit money, scarce resources and time to prosecute these people fully. If people are alerted that they may be charged or if people are charged and then let out on bail, they usually end up fleeing the country, and I am sad to say that that is often in compliance with the embassies in those countries. The Asian countries are usually satisfied with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, if this legislation is passed, as it will be, we will have to work more closely with officials in those countries to assist and facilitate them. That will not always be easy to do because bribery and corruption are rife in many areas. The police in those countries are under-funded, as are the legal services. Often the populace is ignorant of what has to be done and is compliant with what happens. This is particularly so in the villages, which is where a lot of these girls come from to work in the bigger cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe there is scope for us to assist by working with them, advising them, offering training and providing money in some cases. I believe we could spend some of our foreign aid money, of which we spend a lot each year, in a worthwhile manner. We could spend it on educational campaigns in those countries. We could advise them and assist them in printing leaflets which could be distributed in the villages of those countries that supply a lot of the girls. I believe we could also do much more by supplying leaflets advising of the dangers and the penalties to tourists who go out of Australia to those target destinations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is really horrific to read what happens. I refer to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New York Times Magazine</EMPHASIS> of 16 January this year. An article reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nit, a peasant girl from the north, was sold for the price of a television. In the Bangkok shelter where we met, she sat politely on the edge of a sofa, fidgeting with her hair. At 13, she still looked small and guileless enough to play with dolls. And she talked only in whispers. Five months ago, an agent paid her father 8,000 baht (about $320). The agent, a soldier, told her she would wash dishes; instead he took her to a house with 15 other girls.</PARA>

After that she lost count and went down to the "normal" price of 200 baht&mdash;$8 for an hour. Her boss kept all the money. Nit seemed oddly resigned to her plight, perhaps because it was her father's decision. But now, she whispered, she would prefer to go home.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Sister Michele, the session is astonishing. In the four years she has worked with prostituted children, moments when the children let out their pain are very rare. She says they bury their feelings and hide their experiences even when they visit the doctor, sore with venereal diseases. Some girls so effectively block out the past that they forget their home address or even their parents' names. Sister Michele says she is only just learning how troubled the children are, how much attention they need. "We have to talk things out very, very slowly," she says. "The children feel so worthless, they believe they are dirty, that they are bad."</PARA>
<PARA>If more Australians gave some thought to what they are doing to these children, perhaps they would be less inclined to engage in these despicable activities. Australia supports, and is signatory to, four international instruments that are relevant to this legislation here today: the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which is particularly relevant. Article 34 of the children's convention imposes an obligation on states to protect the children from all forms of sexual exploitation and abuse. It requires that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">State Parties undertake to protect the child from all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse. For these purposes, State Parties shall in particular take all appropriate national, bilateral and multilateral measures to prevent:</PARA>

<PARA>Under article 35, states are to take all appropriate national, bilateral and multilateral measures to prevent the abduction, sale or traffic in children for any purpose or in any form. I think everybody in this chamber would certainly support that, although I note that the previous speaker, the honourable member for McEwen, berated the coalition for having doubts about some of these international treaties that we are becoming signatories to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All we on this side of the chamber are asking is that these international treaties, which impact on laws&mdash;particularly state laws&mdash;come before this House for consideration before we sign them. I do not think that request is unreasonable in any shape or form. Although we support all of the matters which I have read out, there are many others which we do not support. The very least we can do is bring the treaties before this chamber for consideration before we sign them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I strongly support this legislation. There will be difficulties, but so be it. Once this legislation is passed, I believe we will stop the majority of Australians from engaging in this type of activity. That in itself makes it very worth while. Perhaps we will be successful enough to stop 90 per cent or more of the Australians who engage in these activities from doing so&mdash;even if we can do that by instilling fear in them by making them aware of the penalties that are involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that the penalties contained in this legislation for engaging in sexual acts on children are very severe indeed. The maximum penalty for engaging in sexual intercourse with children under 16 years old is 14 years imprisonment and with children under 12 years old it is 17 years imprisonment. This legislation seems to cover every angle&mdash;not just engaging in sexual activity. If a child is induced to commit, submit to or participate in, or be present while a third person commits acts of indecency in the presence of the person but they are not committed by or on him or her, 10 years imprisonment applies in the case of children under 16 years old and 12 years imprisonment in the case of children under 12 years old.

I am pleased to see that the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) has agreed to that, and an advisory report will come back from that committee by 30 May 1994.

Why can these countries and why will these countries not ensure that sexual exploitation of their children is stopped? A visit to these countries would show that many of them are trying to curb this awful trade in children, but they are faced with many other daunting political, social and economic problems which tend to dominate their governments' thinking, planning and strategies.

However, I am positive that, despite the differing philosophical stances, when it comes to our obligation to protect children at both the national and international levels from sexual exploitation and abuse, all parties would be of one mind: this practice must end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For too long we in Australia have turned a blind eye to the exploitation of children throughout the world and, more importantly, in our neighbouring countries to the near north. Far too many Australians salve their consciences in the yearly gift to overseas aid organisations and then forget to press their elected representatives to address problems such as this. Child exploitation is a problem which many of us find too difficult to discuss. We need to address in a very real sense the lot of children in overseas countries. As I said before, I commend the minister for taking on the issue of child exploitation as I believe that will encourage Australians to discuss the issue rather than neatly tuck it away out of sight and out of mind, creating a further advantage to those sick and twisted people already exploiting children for sexual pleasure. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember an attempt in the 1980s to discuss the issue of child exploitation in Australia. Unfortunately, the discussion of this important issue was initiated by an organised paedophile group. This group justified the act of sex between adults and children, using the spurious argument that children are capable of making up their own minds about whether or not they want to have sex and that other adults have been impairing these children's rights. What a spurious argument that was&mdash;one which was totally rejected by the Australian community.

Possibly due to our physical isolation as a nation, Australians are naive in regard to the responsibility we have as tourists and the power we have through our financial capacities.

It is staggering and horrifying to realise that somewhere in the world more than one million children become prostitutes each year.

It is vitally important that our neighbours know who we are, what we think, what we believe is right and, more importantly, what we believe is wrong. It is those understandings that will surely underpin any trade agreement or relationship based upon business and economic growth. It is alarming to note that some corporations now use sex, just like alcohol, to service clients and socialise with their colleagues. Australia has a proud record in fighting for human rights in other countries. Australia also has an enviable record in addressing health issues, such as AIDS. It may be that, apart from what we are contemplating in this bill, we are able to assist with our expertise in the area of AIDS and sexually transmitted disease research to go some way in redressing the problems that Australian males have, in part, created. </PARA>

The amendments to the Crimes Act 1914, child sex tourism offences, is such an issue. I thank and commend the minister for his very strong and productive efforts to help Australians come to terms with this problem. I understand that the Minister for Justice has been able to obtain a commitment, through the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and the Australasian Police Ministers Council, to ensure cooperation between federal authorities and state and territory police forces in the investigation of offences under the proposed legislation. I have also been advised that, as a further means of deterrence and control of child sexual exploitation, the standing committee has also agreed to develop a common approach to dealing with the financial activities of paedophile groups within Australia and to focus on the possession, production, sale and distribution of child pornography. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One thought which comes to mind when we stand before the House as parliamentarians who have been elected by our people to represent them is that children are our most valuable resource. Last year's national child protection week theme, `Children are people too', is a wonderful adage to keep in mind. As individuals, children are entitled to the same human rights afforded adults.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ironically, though, children need protection and, sadly, it is often adults from whom they need to be protected. I am proud to say that the federal government is protecting them and is doing its utmost in the context of today's legislation, the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill 1994. I am also pleased that this legislation has bipartisan agreement in this House. What better time than our International Year of the Family to introduce such legislation. As a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, the federal government must meet its obligations to protect our children. We, as a government, recognise the importance of enhancing the quality of children's lives and, hence, society's future. This legislation aims to provide a real and enforceable deterrent to the sexual abuse of children, outside of Australia, by Australian citizens and residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) has stated, unfortunately a minority&mdash;and I stress `a minority' but still too many&mdash;of Australian citizens and residents are now known internationally as major offenders in several Asian countries. They exploit the vulnerability of children in foreign countries where laws against child sexual abuse may not be as strict or as consistently enforced as they are within Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before the House aims to ensure that crimes committed against children outside of Australia and which are not prosecuted in the country in which they are committed are dealt with effectively in Australia. The bill also focuses on the activities of those who promote, organise and profit from child sex tourism. If they operate from Australia or have a relevant link with Australia, they also can be prosecuted for their contribution to the abuse of foreign children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support this bill wholeheartedly. I am genuinely disgusted with abuse of children, all children around the world, regardless of the form that abuse takes. I am particularly incensed that some adults use their power to exploit our children. This bill will impose substantial penalties, ranging from 10 to 17 years imprisonment or, correspondingly, high pecuniary penalties if a company is involved. I suppose, personally, I would go a lot further than that. But we must at least have a beginning. Important too is that the defendant's rights to fair and proper hearings are ensured, given the difficulties in using overseas evidence and, of course, child witnesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I reiterate here in this House: protecting children is of paramount importance. The appalling stories of sexual abuse of our children are many and varied. I know that many honourable members, in speaking to this bill, have brought up examples. Of course, various media reports have attributed the gravitation to children for sex to the fact that adults fear the catching of AIDS. Presumably, these exploiters do not feel concerned about transmitting AIDS to our young people or perhaps naively they believe that children are immune from catching or transmitting AIDS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that recently in one country it was estimated that 1,000 young boys and girls are now selling their bodies. In the case of those boys and girls, it is to feed themselves. That is a significant increase in recent years&mdash;and the country to which I refer is not an Asian country. According to another recent report about sex tours, men questioned about involvement believe that they are contributing to the country's economy by visiting and exploiting young girls in that particular country. With that kind of attitude, obviously today's legislation is more than timely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That report, which I read also, stated that sex tours now have become part of accepted and entrenched business practices. It has been mentioned already by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Quick), that some corporations are now using sex, just like alcohol, to service their clients and to socialise with their colleagues. Young impoverished girls come from vast squatter areas offering sex services to business and other foreign tourists. It is critical and crucial that countries like Australia&mdash;I understand that Germany is also introducing similar legislation&mdash;persist in stamping out these abhorrent practices of exploiting young children. If we are blase and continue to be complacent, then any action or publicity about the subject will just dissipate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, in January of 1990 the arrest and subsequent conviction in Bangkok of a well-known American paedophile on charges of molesting teenage boys made local headlines for a whole two weeks. Angry letters appeared in Thai language newspapers expressing shock and disgust about the incident and the condemnation of paedophiles, but after the initial outrage the story just died down and became just another item to be filed away and forgotten by all. Despite media reports that scores of other foreign paedophiles are arrested in Thailand, many people do not realise that Thailand now is the major destination for international paedophile tour groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bangkok based non-government organisation End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism, ECPAT, claims that organised groups of paedophiles in a number of developed countries are using places such as Thailand as their hunting ground. How disgusting to think it is young children that these people are hunting. According to ECPAT, paedophiles set up regular sex tours in which children, some as young as eight and nine, are used to satisfy customers. ECPAT has also stated that paedophile groups are the base of a highly profitable international market for child pornography produced in various Asian countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Getting the public in Thailand, and in the rest of the world for that matter, to believe that paedophile organisations exist is difficult. The executive secretary of ECPAT stated that around the world it seems to be that the idea of an adult having sex with a child is so repulsive that people do not even want to think about it. We cannot continue to be ostriches and put our heads in the sand. It is hard to imagine such things, but whether it is hard to imagine them or not, the fact of the matter is that it is happening. That is why the Australian government is introducing this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reading various publications and articles on child prostitution truly is a revelation. Reports are common of westerners regularly visiting Asian countries where `they have a warehouse full of young boys and you can do whatever you want with them.' Tourists actually purchase a slave for their own use. For a few hours that slave can be required to do whatever the tourist-master desires and that child ceases to have any rights whatsoever in that relationship. The power imbalances and exploitation are obvious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other such appalling stories. Another example is of a European tourist who took a young girl to a hotel where he and other men beat her black and blue and then raped her. But there is often very little available information on offenders. An ECPAT social worker said recently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every time someone looks into the issue of child sexploitation, they look at the children instead of the adults.</PARA>
<PARA>She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There have been television documentaries and newspaper articles about child prostitutes that don't think twice about prying into the background of the children.</PARA>
<PARA>She continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now, whenever a journalist wants to interview me on the subject, I ask them why they don't go and study the paedophiles instead.</PARA>
<PARA>That is just what legislation of this ilk can do: concentrate more on the perpetrator of crimes rather than on the victims.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aligned with sex exploitation is the highly exploitative practice of child pornography. On a worldwide scale child pornography is already a lucrative business and the demand for it is increasing. Unfortunately, in many Asian countries it is easy to exploit the poor and to buy children because the laws of their countries do not provide adequate protection for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sex exploitation of children is really not the only issue of current concern to the Australian government. Physical violence is another aspect that we must continue to monitor. Saving our children from all forms of abuse is imperative. The federal government must continue to embark on ways to prevent child abuse. Most of us in this parliament, I believe, know of, have heard of or have read about child abuse. I am not talking just about overseas countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even in our own country, the media tends to focus on sensational stories of battered and abused children. I think we were all horrified by reports of recent tragedies, such as the death of Daniel Valerio in Victoria. We learned then how people dealing with that case really were privy to information about what was happening to him but failed to act quickly enough. We do not need that in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The underlying causes and reasons for child abuse are less well known and they are now harder to define and quantify. We see sensational media stories which often suggest that solutions are easy. That is not the case. Apart from sexual abuse, maltreatment of children takes many forms ranging from emotional abuse or excessive discipline to severe beatings or, as in the example I just referred to, death. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Child abuse is a multidimensional problem. It is caused by many factors impacting on families across a wide variety of our social structures. Alarmingly, statistical information on the subject of the abuse of children even within this country has stated that there were some 49,721 cases of child abuse and neglect reported to our welfare departments between 1 July 1990 and 30 June 1991. That is only one year. Child abuse or neglect was substantiated in 45 per cent of the 46,769 cases finalised in that financial year. This is here within Australia and does not take into account what is happening overseas. Even within our own country, in 64 per cent of substantiated cases of abuse of children, a parent or guardian was identified as responsible either for the abuse or neglect of that child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Childhood abuse and neglect has long-term ramifications for our young people. We have seen studies that have stated that it could substantially contribute to the development of mental illness and behavioural and emotional disturbances. Leaving aside the emotional and physical cost to the abused children, we must at all times remember that it is our obligation as legislators to protect those who cannot protect themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always believed that mandatory reporting of child abuse, while it is at the moment a state and territory government responsibility, must operate all over Australia. Through the Commonwealth government's National Child Protection Council, comprised of Commonwealth, state, territory, local government and community representatives, the federal government is seeking to implement national uniform standards. That will, I believe, encourage state and territory governments to provide sufficient resources for proper follow-up of cases reported within our country&mdash;to take action to improve child protection and to take those protective measures early. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government's strategy, I am pleased to say, will provide a framework within which professionals can work for the prevention of child abuse. Some of those key elements, while it may not be relevant to this particular bill, I think need to be repeated in debates such as this. We hope through that strategy to raise the awareness of the nature and extent of child abuse and encourage adults to relate to children in a positive way. We hope to teach parents, service workers and children about child abuse prevention skills. We need to encourage other programs to take account of children and to develop efforts which contribute to preventing child abuse. We need through that program to provide early intervention support services and the program will also develop local prevention initiatives to make it easier for parents to ask for help and easier for people to offer help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I applaud our government on this very important program and for the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill 1994 before this House today. I commend the Minister for Justice, as other speakers have done. The bill has enormous potential to stem abuse against children. We must continue to have our government introduce a host of comprehensive policies which benefit and serve the needs of all Australians and also assist in preventing effects for children all around the world. At the nub of all we do and all we strive for must be the protection of our children. Accordingly, I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have listened with interest to my colleagues' contributions. I am very pleased to support this bill. I applaud the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) and the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) for this legislation. We can be immensely proud of this government's law reform agenda, particularly in relation to human rights, to the rights of families, women and children, and to the protection of the innocent. The principal aim of the bill is to provide a real and enforceable deterrent to the sexual abuse of children outside Australia by Australian citizens and residents. This is groundbreaking work and we are taking an international leadership role in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, this bill is looking to provide a deterrent to two categories of people who feed off the `sick' industry of sexually abusing children from overseas countries: firstly, the perpetrators of these insidious acts and, secondly, those people or organisations who promote, organise and profit from this vile form of tourism&mdash;the child sex trade. What we are essentially talking about is one of the most vile forms of colonial exploitation. Colonialism, I believe, should be dead and buried, but in this we can see a new form of colonial exploitation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Principally, the Philippines and Thailand are the foremost countries in which these sexual acts are carried out on vulnerable children by foreign tourists. As has been said by previous speakers, poverty and ignorance in the victim countries contribute to this shocking trade. Other Asian nations such as China, Sri Lanka and Korea also have developing sex-based tourism industries which effectively exploit children. It is important to state that our foreign aid objectives are very important here. We can assist in solving this problem in the countries of origin by making sure that the standard of living, which will include effective population control strategies, is maintained. We are doing all we can to help our neighbours in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been estimated that over one million children become prostitutes each year, with many of those being in Asia. Many of these children are forced into prostitution after being sold or abandoned by their parents who cannot afford to look after them. Others have been stolen from their villages. Some parents have been deliberately misled by traffickers in the child sex trade and are unaware of the fate that awaits their children in the towns and cities where this trade is carried out. It would be fair to say that parents care for their children. We should have a more effective understanding of our Asian neighbours, their culture, their religions and their social organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the unreliability of figures, most members in this House would be aware that a number of Australians have, for many years, knowingly exploited children of overseas countries by their involvement in child sex tours. This has been referred to by previous speakers. In several Asian nations Australians are major offenders in these practices. These people epitomise the ugly Australian stereotype and are truly the white trash of Asia. This should be seen as a national scandal. It does nothing to improve our standing in the nations that we seek to effectively integrate as our trading partners and friends in our area of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no good for people to turn a blind eye and dismiss the activities of a minority of Australians because they are not happening in our backyard. As we move towards greater economic and social ties with our Asian friends, I would argue that these crimes against Asian children are taking place in our backyard. To continue our push towards integration with Asia would be hypocrisy if we are going to let some of our nationals get away with these practices. It would show an ignorance and lack of respect to our friends in the countries to our near north. As a self-respecting nation concerned about its international reputation, we cannot let this situation occur. I commend the Minister for Justice for his leadership in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill is an internationally responsible piece of legislation similar to existing laws already introduced in Germany, Sweden and Norway. In fact, Australia is already earning an international reputation for doing something about the problem. This legislation complements the strategy adopted by the Australian Federal Police of targeting travel agencies catering to paedophiles. It is important to remember that illicit sex tourism is an international responsibility. Francois Lefort, a French priest and doctor who has dedicated his life to fighting child prostitution throughout the world, has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This problem is not just Bangkok's, Colombo's, Manila's. It is Paris', Brussels', Rome's.</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that this problem is also Canberra's and Australia's, and this bill concurs with those sentiments. The sexual exploitation of children is in direct conflict with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which Australia ratified in 1990. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . parties undertake to protect the child from all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse.</PARA>
<PARA>This UN convention alone compels Australia to act on the magnitude of the problem. Australia proudly played a key role in the development of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Australian government is committed to pursuing the aims of that convention. This legislation is part of delivering on that commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill aims to achieve these ends by creating sexual offences relating to conduct outside Australia by Australians, which will be punishable in Australia. It will be an offence to encourage, facilitate or profit from child sex tourism which may be committed in or out of Australia and will be punishable in Australia provided there is a relevant association with this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All these offences will have substantial penalties ranging from 10 to 17 years imprisonment or correspondingly high pecuniary penalties if a company is involved. I think this is very important because until we legislate and provide penalties we are not sending a clear message that such behaviour is not to be tolerated. We condemn this sort of behaviour, as is shown in our legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill has the support of all Australian jurisdictions through the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. State and territory governments are also committed to providing supplementary legislation should any perceived gaps eventuate. It is a good example of the positive use of the external affairs powers of the constitution, which can forward our national goals and is being used very effectively by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill creates prescribed sexual offences committed overseas against children under the age of 16 and aggravated sexual offences where children are under the age of 12 years.

There are further offences of encouraging or benefiting from child sex tourism, carrying a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill presents a number of challenges to Australian legal conventions. These include: difficulties with obtaining overseas evidence; problems of the age of consent, which for the purposes of this bill is set at 16; the age at which the aggravated offence of child sex abuse occurs, which this bill sets at under 12; ensuring that the rights of the defendant are not compromised&mdash;the bill is not a witch-hunt or an attempt to impose our will on other countries in the region&mdash;and difficult-to-detect offences in some countries due to the nature of law enforcement practices in those countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see that the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) has suggested that this bill be sent to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and I understand that the justice minister is prepared to support that. Overall, the bill highlights the need for cooperation between law enforcement bodies in Australia and overseas to continue the massive challenge of tackling this problem. Any finetuning that the standing committee can do will be welcome because obviously we want to have this bill optimally drafted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can appreciate that many people would still be unaware of the need to legislate in Australia to confront problems created by child sex tours. It is still true that Australians would like not to have to face and confront the unpalatable facts of child sex exploitation in our own country. An historical consequence of Australia's past paternalistic society has encouraged some men to indulge their sexuality and their need to abuse their power in relationships not only with children in this country but also with children in other countries who are seen to have less of a personhood due to our own ignorance and racism. We cannot allow these practices to go unchallenged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Responsible Australians need to do everything possible to reduce the number of Asian children entertaining two to four foreigners per night. Resulting health statistics are that 50 per cent of Thai child prostitutes are assessed as being HIV-positive. Not only is this going to lead to alarming consequences for the health and welfare of those children, but it will spread the HIV virus throughout Asia and into those colonial exploitative countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst it would be fanciful to suggest that this legislation will wipe out child prostitution, it is a very important step to take responsibility. As the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) said in her speech before I began my contribution to the debate, we are talking about the abuse of power. As Ron O'Grady mentions in his material on the subject of child sex tourism:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tourism is the selling of dreams. It gives ordinary middle class people from Western nations the chance to live like royalty. In their own country the tourist income and savings may appear modest and they may have a somewhat boring and servile occupation, but once they enter a poor country they have the instant capacity to live as if they were rulers.</PARA>
<PARA>This is nowhere seen more clearly than in child prostitution. Thomas, an American paedophile, is a carpenter. He travels as a tourist to Thailand and the Philippines as often as he can afford to do so. In Bangkok, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They have a warehouse full of young boys and you can do whatever you want with them.</PARA>
<PARA>The meaning is clear. The tourist is purchasing a slave for his own use. For a few hours the slave can be required to do whatever the tourist master desires and the child ceases to have any rights in the relationship. This form of modern slavery naturally opens the door to all forms of sadism. I think this is one of the worst forms of exploitation of foreign children in that because of ignorance and racism it allows an absolute abuse of power, which these people know is not tolerated in their own country. I quote further from Ron O'Grady's material:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On January 31 1984 fire broke out in a brothel in Phuket province in the south of Thailand. Firemen sifting through the ashes were shocked to find the bodies of five young girls, burned to death because they were chained to their beds and could not escape. One of the girls had been bought from her parents for $200.</PARA>
<PARA>This sort of shocking abuse is happening all over South-East Asia. It will do nothing to forward the economic future of those countries or our reputation if Australian nationals are, as they are&mdash;and it is well known&mdash;taking part. I quote further from the material:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are villages in north east Thailand where it is hard to find any children at all. Parents in some cases are selling their children from the earliest years. There was a public outcry in 1990 when a Thai newspaper reported that a pregnant young woman in the north had sold her child into prostitution even before the little girl or boy was born.</PARA>
<PARA>This is not an indictment on this particular woman; it is an indictment on the alarming poverty in these countries which leads to such situations. I refer back to the speech of my colleague the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland) on the involvement of Thai culture in this tourism. O'Grady suggests that widespread prostitution really developed as a consequence of the Vietnam War. O'Grady says that by the end of the Vietnam War in 1975 the sex industry had become firmly established. But the end of the war also raised questions about the future of several million people whose livelihood had been built around the inflow of American war dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two things started to emerge at this time. The first was the growth of a large indigenous sex trade. Thai men who had not been particularly avid customers of brothels in earlier history suddenly began to cultivate a new lifestyle. Tens of thousands of out of work prostitutes became available to Thai men, even in the poorer suburbs. Older and handicapped prostitutes began to sell their bodies for as little as a few cents. Now it has been claimed that 450,000 Thai men visit a prostitute every day. So it would appear that this is a relatively new historical phenomenon in Thailand and the result of a very unfortunate episode in Western history in Asia; one of the side effects of one of the last colonial exploitations in South East Asia, the Vietnam War.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the recent visit of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to Asia and the opening of the new friendship bridge we have a very important opportunity to gain a significant reputation as a friend to our Asian neighbours.

However, when it comes to selling children from poor families into slavery and these kids then become objects for sale to tourists, it becomes sick and alarming. It is hard to imagine that we have ordinary Australians from all sorts of backgrounds setting off to buy child sex from agencies in such countries as Thailand, the Philippines and other parts of Asia. So much for our image as a clean, green country, as reliable business partners or as a socially just society. This shows our other side as Western dominators, our suspected superiority over other cultures, our racism that lurks beneath our benign exteriors. We are really kidding ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sad to think that this legislation is needed in Australia, but I know that it is from hearing from our ambassadors and trade people oversees, from reading the exposes in various magazines and newspapers. We are no better than the Japanese, western Europeans or the Americans when it comes to child prostitution. People both in this country and overseas are making a fortune out of it, leaving the youngsters involved with little or no money, sick and dying, and slaves to their own poverty. Once the young are in the business there is little or no way out, except in a coffin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similar laws to this one, I understand, are being considered in Germany and may have only a limited effect, but they are important from a moral point of view and say something about us as a country. This law will mean we are taking responsibility for our own citizens' behaviour overseas. It will act as some sort of deterrent and will be the first step towards solving the problem of people targeting children in less developed countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we need to do more. We need to assist these countries to provide better working conditions for their people, better pay and training, better health and education so they can break away from having to sell their children to survive. Ron O'Grady, international coordinator for a Bangkok based campaign to end child prostitution&mdash;my colleague the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) quoted him on several occasions in her speech&mdash;seems to have a lot of information and seems to be one of the leaders in this area of understanding the situation. He stated in an article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Incidents are becoming increasingly prevalent in Asia but only in certain selected countries. Tourists are obviously careful about the places they visit for sexual purposes and their choice has been governed to a large extent by the reputation of the country for tolerance in sexual matters. Poor countries have an obvious attraction for paedophiles from affluent countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Children and their parents are more desperate for money and are therefore easy targets for procurers. The government has greater priorities than the fate of a few thousand street children and police will often turn a blind eye to events in exchange for a supplement to their meagre wages.</PARA>
<PARA>Hence one of the major problems that I saw in Asia: lowly paid and poorly trained police forces. While there is a market and the police are part of the pay-off, there will be no great change. Everything becomes a commodity, even the human beings. This situation has to change and these amendments to the crimes law are only one way that Australia can take responsibility for its own citizens. I hope Germany goes down the same path and that all other countries who are known to have tourists seeking this sort of gratification also seek to change their laws to give the same recognition as we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this is only the tip of the iceberg and we need to deal with the poverty these countries face. We need to get rid of the need for families to sell their children into slavery. The underlying reason why they sell their children is poverty. If we do that, then the rest of the chain can be easily broken and they can move towards a more just society. </PARA>

<PARA>In so moving, let me acknowledge that the suggestion of this course of action was initiated by the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), who proposed to me that we might use this quite unusual mechanism to allow the House to undertake a close examination of this bill and to trial the process through the House committees, which processes are at present more customarily conducted in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Previously such a suggestion has been put to me and I indicated that, subject to receiving suitable understandings in relation to the courses of the Senate, I would be content with that course. I have spoken to Senator Spindler from the Australian Democrats, who has indicated that he is content not to refer this bill again to a Senate committee should it be subject to examination in the House. He, in any case, proposed that his specific concerns be addressed in debate and discussion in the Senate sitting as the Senate. Being so reassured and with the shadow Attorney indicating that the opposition is content that its concerns be addressed through this process, I am pleased to be able to facilitate this procedure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regard this process as somewhat of a trial.

Both in the House and watching the debate on closed circuit television, I have been impressed by the sincerity and obvious concern of members on both sides of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note the comments that have been made by a number of speakers, including the last speaker, the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams), that this issue also raises broader social questions about how Australia can most effectively deal with international poverty and the way in which people in many countries are induced into the sale of their children or their own exploitation in this pernicious trade. These are matters with which this government has very much concerned itself. In that context, I also note the work that Brian Burdekin, the human rights commissioner, is undertaking on behalf of the international community to ensure that the international community has this whole issue quite high on its agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With those few remarks, I commend this process to the House.

<PARA>This bill amends seven acts, five of which are administered within the transport portfolio and two of which are administered within the communications and the arts portfolio. Most of the amendments are of a technical nature and represent a finetuning and clarification of provisions of various acts administered within the portfolio.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments do not introduce substantial new policy schemes, although some of the amendments introduce minor policy initiatives.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of Australia's bilateral air services agreements and arrangements embody an obligation that `substantial ownership and effective control' will reside in the nationals of the contracting party. The agreements generally provide authority for a contracting state to withhold, revoke or suspend operating permission if the party which has made the designation cannot demonstrate that its designated airline or airlines meet national ownership and control tests. Australia is bound under the Chicago Convention to supply to other contracting states and/or the International Civil Aviation Organisation information concerning the ownership and control of any particular aircraft registered in Australia and conducting international air services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is common practice in other countries to either exclude, or limit the extent of, foreign ownership in airlines. The government's decision to limit equity holdings by foreign airlines in Australia's international airlines to 35 per cent in aggregate and to 25 per cent by a single foreign airline was announced on 22 December 1992. The object of the amendments in this bill is to enable the government to ensure that any Australian carrier seeking designation or already designated on an international route can demonstrate its compliance with bilateral requirements that it is substantially owned and effectively controlled by Australian nationals. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendments of the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation Act 1991</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will change the name of the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation Act 1991 to the Telstra Corporation Act 1991 to reflect a change in the name of the company under section 382 of Corporations Law of the ACT. While the application of the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation Act to the company was unaffected by the change of the company's name, alignment of the name of the act with the name of the company will avoid any confusion on the part of the public. The company continues to trade in Australia as `Telecom Australia' and internationally as `Telstra OTC Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of consequential changes to the act consequential upon the name change of the company.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Navigation Act is amended to consolidate into one section a number of provisions that allow exemptions to be granted from the requirement to comply with the act.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Six existing sections in the Navigation Act are being combined by this bill into one section to provide that the minister or the Australian Maritime Safety Authority may exempt a person or a vessel from the operation of specified provisions of the act.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes a minor amendment to the Telecommunications Act 1991 to implement the government's decision that the Indian Ocean territories&mdash;Christmas and Cocos (Keeling) Islands&mdash;are to be treated as part of Australia for the purposes of Commonwealth law. The amendment is consequential upon a 1992 amendment to the Acts Interpretation Act which provided that Australia include Christmas and Cocos (Keeling) Islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This minor amendment to the Telecommunications Act is the only amendment to the act necessary to implement the decision. It requires external territories to which the universal service obligation does not extend to be prescribed. The universal service obligation provides that access to and supply of the standard telephone service and payphones must be provided throughout Australia. Currently the obligation specifically does not apply in the external territories to which the act extends. The amendment will ensure that the universal obligation applies to the Indian Ocean territories. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an issue that I have had a long and genuine interest in over the five years that I have been looking after this portfolio on behalf of the federal coalition. It brings me a great deal of pleasure to see the parliament of Australia, the government of this country, moving in the direction that we are moving in, and have been for some time now&mdash;that is, to try to tidy up a number of important issues relating to our maritime industries. These are issues that relate to the safety of ships at sea and to the protection of our marine environment. All of them are terribly important to Australia, our being a major maritime trading nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we have the fifth largest maritime task in the world. Of course, we have one of the largest coastlines in the world, and that needs to be protected. In particular, we have some of the most famous parts of the world's coastline around the Great Barrier Reef. All of them are very important tourist income earners for Australia, and they need proper protection. This bill adds to those bills that have preceded it in this House over the last year or two. It further protects the Australian maritime environment, our coastline, and tightens up some areas of ship safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For my part, the opposition will not be opposing the bill, as we have not opposed, and indeed have supported, so many of these bills over recent times. As I have said on other occasions, whilst I am responsible for this area of the federal opposition's interests, we will always support sensible, reasonable, rational legislation that improves safety at sea and improves our ability to protect our maritime environment and our coastline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an area of genuine bipartisan support. I think the people of Australia can rest assured that what can be done is being done. We are prepared to accept government initiatives. Likewise, we would like to think that the government would accept sensible, rational and reasonable propositions that are put forward from this side of the House in this area. Over time we have put forward a number of reasonable propositions. I would like to see those picked up by the government in legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the aspects of the bill that relate to my portfolio. The first is the Navigation Act 1912. There are some minor amendments tidying up the act. The industry regards these as sensible, and so do we. The second aspect of the bill that is pertinent to me involves the Occupational Health and Safety (Maritime Industry) Act 1993. There is a minor amendment enabling the Governor-General to make some regulations. As has often been the case in recent times, it raises the question of why it was omitted from the original act, which was passed through this parliament just last year. We so often see legislation introduced into the House and within a matter of months or a year or so it is brought back for some tidying up. Whilst we cannot get everything right all the time, it does raise the fact that we need to be more careful in the drawing up of these bills to ensure that we do not have to take up the time of the parliament, which is at a considerable cost to the taxpayer of Australia, in overcoming minor amendments like this which reflect shortfalls in the drafting of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third aspect involves the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Act 1981. This provides for recovery of loss, damages, costs or expenses incurred by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority in the combat of pollution. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority is the body that looks after all of Australia's maritime regulations. It looks after navigation equipment, navigation aids and all those things that are important to the maritime industry in Australia. It operates through a cost recovery process. Whatever costs it incurs on behalf of the government, the government has to pay for. It runs like a normal business, but it has a very important task. In light of that, this amendment will now enable it to recover any costs or damages incurred by it through its role of combating pollution at sea. This is very important because any pollution caused at sea can run into very large dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As people will remember, probably the most spectacular pollution at sea incident in Australia in recent years was the break-up of the ship <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> off the Western Australian coastline, when the bow of the ship fell off and oil poured out into the water. The cost of cleaning that up and rescuing the crew and all those other things can be and should be recovered. This legislation ensures that is so. It can run into tens of millions of dollars and in some instances even hundreds of millions of dollars. Probably the most spectacular internationally known oil pollution incident occurred with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Exxon Valdez</EMPHASIS> in Prince William Sound a few years ago. I think the cost involved in tidying that up ran to about a billion dollars overall. So we are not talking about a little bit of pocket money here. It is very substantial. This bill enables AMSA to pick up any costs it has incurred in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Chamber of Shipping, which primarily represents foreign flag vessels, was concerned that AMSA's right of recovery would be limited to recovery from parties proven responsible for a pollution breach under legislation and that this would obviate the need to draw on funding through the oil pollution levy. It was concerned to know whether this was the case. In fact, it is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not so long ago, this parliament, supported again by the opposition, passed legislation enabling Australia to contribute to the international compensation fund. Funds are paid into this international fund by all ship operators around the world. If there is a major oil spill or some form of pollution at sea, the cost of cleaning it up can be recovered from that fund. What we are doing here enables us to bypass calling on the international compensation fund and go directly to the person who it is proven is responsible for the cause of that pollution and charge him or her for the cost of it. This means that the cost of cleaning up pollution at sea can be focused right back onto the people responsible rather than being a burden on the international shipping community at large. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth aspect relevant to my responsibilities is the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983. This provides for the detention of foreign flag vessels suspected of violations within Australian territorial waters.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some representations from the Australian Chamber of Shipping expressed concerned about some aspects of this. We referred the matter to a Senate committee. Our colleagues in the other place established a committee to look into this particular concern, and the Australian Chamber of Shipping representatives had a chance to outline their case there. It was properly heard and the committee made its judgment. But the chamber felt that the legislation unfairly discriminates against foreign flag vessels by preventing them from sailing whilst Australian flag vessels are free to trade on. The Chamber of Shipping made it clear that it did not seek to protect disreputable shipping operators but, rather, to ensure that the powers in the legislation were not used to detain foreign flag vessels while investigations were carried out to determine the cause of a pollution incident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that, whilst foreign flag vessels&mdash;if they are suspected of causing pollution in Australian waters&mdash;could be detained at port whilst tests are carried out to see who is actually responsible for the cause of pollution, Australian flag vessels are not detained. There is a good reason for this: Australian flag vessels technically never leave Australian jurisdiction, whereas a foreign flag vessel within a couple of hours steaming time of a port can leave Australian jurisdiction and never return. Hence, if it is responsible for that pollution, we have no opportunity to recover the costs incurred in cleaning it up or to penalise those people for causing that pollution in the first place. Whilst it does seem on the surface to be unfair to foreign flag vessels, on balance, when one considers that Australian flag vessels never leave Australian jurisdiction whereas foreign flag vessels can, then we would consider this aspect of the legislation to be reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian National Maritime Association, which is the body that represents Australian flag vessel owners and operators, pointed out that Australian flag vessels are already subject to stringent legislation domestically, and this legislation makes foreign flag vessels similarly liable. In the view of the Australian flag operators, this legislation puts Australian flag ships and foreign flag vessels on an even footing. ANMA argues that no responsible shipper would object to measures to protect waters from ships poorly maintained and staffed, and that is a view that I have confirmed from my own experience. Most Australian shippers are aware of the down sides of bad publicity if some pollution occurs at sea, and they generally act very responsibly. It is not the case with every single shipper, but I think it is fair to say it is the case in general. The Chamber of Shipping agreed with that sentiment. Its concern was that undue delay not be imposed, and it wanted to ensure that any delays to the movement of member ships were avoided and to remove any inequity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that the legislation being brought into the House today is in line with provisions of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. About 80 countries around the world adhere to this particular law making Australian vessels subject to the same provisions and the same supposed inequities in non-Australian ports. So, on balance, my colleagues in the opposition and I think that this is a fair amendment to the legislation and that it is the only way to maintain jurisdiction, since none applies to a non-port state flag vessel once it has left the jurisdiction of a port state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate committee shared ACOS's concerns that unnecessary delay should not result. It did not extend that concern to poorly maintained vessels but it felt, as I think most people would feel, that poorly maintained vessels should have the wrath of God brought down upon them whereas others should not. I think the Senate committee probably reflected the general view in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee said that AMSA will have to put in place a very efficient system for the collection and analysis of samples. In the case of vessels that have departed port, this could mean intercepting ships to obtain samples. The committee also said that AMSA must streamline the system of securing financial responsibility through P&amp;I clubs and that it should be possible to arrange for samples to be obtained without having vessels return to port. Interestingly enough, the AMSA witnesses at the committee confirmed that return to port would be required only in an extreme case. The committee observed that this should be the case even where a number of ships are being investigated for a breach, even if they are still in port. So delay need not occur and, indeed, in most cases should not occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee found that there was no basic inequality in the provisions of the legislation. The committee did, however, say it would watch the progress of investigations under the legislation and would respond to any industry representations that are made about unusual or lengthy delays resulting in ships being detained. So it is a matter of saying, `Let's try it and see how it is works and, if unreasonable delays are being incurred by foreign flag vessels, perhaps that will be a chance to look at it again.' But, given the assurance that AMSA has offered us, we are satisfied at this stage to let AMSA prove that it will detain vessels only in extreme circumstances. If that is the case, then we will be very happy with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is a piece of legislation which we think, on balance, is worth while and, therefore, we will be supporting it. Ultimately, it will only add further to Australia's excellent reputation as a maritime nation. The Australian flag industry is renowned throughout the world as being a reputable one. We are fast gathering a reputation for being tough on ships of shame, as they are now commonly called; and AMSA is gaining a reputation for being able to pick up a number of these ships that are not up to standard, although from time to time ships do sneak through the net. Indeed, even the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> slipped through the net. If memory serves me right&mdash;I am sure if I am wrong my colleague the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) will point it out&mdash;AMSA even inspected the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> before it sank and found it to be up to scratch, even though it obviously was not. So, from time to time, things do go wrong but AMSA is doing a reasonable job. I think all of us would like to see more inspections undertaken by AMSA to ensure that as many vessels as possible are inspected to enable us to be satisfied that few ships slip through the net. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, we have a very high standard here in Australia but it is worth making the point, as I have made on other occasions, that safety and proper operating procedures are only the product of a viable shipping industry. It is  absolutely important that, whether we are talking about shipping, aircraft, road transport or whatever, safety depends upon the viability of the industry. One of the craziest things that I have seen go through this parliament in recent times was the decision made by this government in the last budget to increase the excise on fuel. This particularly hit hard for the Australian shipping industry. Bunker oil had the excise on it almost, but not quite, doubled. Some late negotiations reduced the proposed new excise, but there was a huge increase in cost to the Australian shipping industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If memory serves me right again, there was an increase of about $287,000 per vessel per year as a result of the fuel excise increase, when on the same day as the budget the shipping industry had just completed its latest round of reforms reducing crew sizes, saving it $217,000 per vessel per year. So here we have Australian shipowners making a genuine attempt to reduce their costs, to make them genuinely internationally competitive, to enable them to have an industry with a future, to enable them to offer people who work within that industry a job in the long term&mdash;all being done by the industry in a most satisfactory fashion&mdash;and the government in its budget statement taking away all of that advantage the industry had just created for itself, and some, by loading an extra excise on bunker oil, whacking up the cost of running the average ship around Australia to the tune of about $287,000 a year. That is stupid and I think my colleagues on the other side&mdash;particularly those who take an interest in this area, like the honourable member for Throsby and the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris)&mdash;though they may not agree with me publicly, would agree with me in their own hearts that that is a silly thing to do and the government should be condemned for doing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth making the point in these sorts of debates that, if we are to be talking about ship safety, occupational health and safety and proper operating procedures on Australian vessels, then we must take into account the ability of Australian shipowners to operate their businesses viably. Decisions like the one we saw in the last budget hinder that process and only harm Australia's capacity to have a world renowned high standard of safety within its shipping industry. They therefore also reduce our ability to protect the Australian coastline because, if we cannot afford the best safety procedures and the best operating procedures, one of these days one of our ships will run up onto the reef and do a great deal of damage to the reef, our tourism industry and our international reputation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is silly to treat the Australian shipping industry as some sort of cargo cult mentality. We have to look at the viability of it; we have to stop increasing taxation on the industry; and, if we do that, we have to ensure that the industry will respond, as it has done in the past, by maintaining very high standards so that we can protect Australia's coastline, protect Australian seamen who operate in our coastal vessels and protect Australia's reputation as a country which is clean and healthy and a great tourist destination with a very reputable shipping industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to join in this debate on the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill. The honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) invited me to make a correction, which I will do in the spirit in which I was invited to. It was not so much AMSA that made the inspection of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS>; rather it was the German Classification Society that gave the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> its clean bill of health.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have done before in this chamber, I publicly state that I agree with what the honourable member for Hume, who has just resumed his seat, said about the levy on fuel. The government made a most unfortunate decision in the last budget. We are one week away from the next budget, and let us hope that levy will be dropped. But I have no argument with what the honourable member for Hume said about the impact of that levy and the other comments he made. I am not ashamed to publicly state that I am in total disagreement with my own party with respect to that measure it took in last year's budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been pointed out, this is an omnibus bill which will make a number of largely non-contentious amendments to legislation administered by the transport and communications portfolio. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr O'Keefe) has pointed out, the principal amendments will be to provide the minister with the power to require divestiture of foreign airline shareholdings in an Australian international airline where those shareholdings exceed 35 per cent of the total value of the issued share capital or in an individual foreign airline which has shareholdings exceeding 25 per cent; to provide for the recovery of any loss, damage, cost or expenses incurred by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority in combating certain pollution discharges or disposals; and to provide for the detention of foreign vessels suspected of causing maritime pollution in an Australian port or Australian territorial sea or exclusive economic zone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought the honourable member for Hume made an important point when he explained how important it was to detain foreign vessels, as opposed to Australian vessels, which are always detained here as they are always in Australian waters. I have no argument with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the debate, I will mainly confine my comments to the amendments dealing with navigation and the amendment dealing with marine pollution legislation. Given that we are an island continent with thousands of miles of coastline and a nation more dependent than most on sea traffic for our imports and exports, we have been remarkably free of marine pollution. I have said before in this chamber that this is more through luck than anything else, especially considering that much of the trade to and from Australia is currently traversing through our prime tourist attraction, the Great Barrier Reef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate that we are debating this issue at the very time that there is a push in some quarters to sell off the Australian National Line. If we as a nation are short-sighted enough to sell off the ANL, we will need this legislation much more than ever before. By selling off the ANL, we will be opening our sea lanes up to the rust buckets of the world. Much has been written in recent years about the threat to our coastline by oil spills. We have seen dramatic film footage of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> incident to reinforce this. It had the potential to not only pollute much of the coast of Western Australia but also wipe out the crayfish industry in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps an even greater danger to our coastline and our marine environment is posed by the operation of ships carrying noxious liquid substances in bulk. We do not hear very much about this. I suppose we hear a lot about oil spills, as they are very visible. If something happens, there is often dramatic footage, as there was in the case of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> incident. But there are ships in somewhat disgraceful condition which are plying up and down the Australian coast carrying all sorts of liquids which are posing perhaps an even greater danger than that posed by oil pollution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite reports such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS>, in many cases the condition of shipping is getting worse. This is because we are not building replacement ships and, consequently, the world's shipping fleet is ageing. So what is Australia's response to the economic, social and environmental challenge of the world's ageing fleet? Some are proposing that we opt out; that we sell off our national line. Honourable members can be assured that, as soon as we sell off the ANL to overseas interests, other Australian flags will also opt out. For example, the BHP fleet could be owned by Hong Kong interests, registered in Cyprus and flying the Cyprus flag, with Greek officers and a crew which is a mixture of Burmese and Filipinos. These well-maintained and well-crewed ships would decline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not to put too fine a point on it, it would be an act of economic stupidity to sell off the ANL. It would diminish our standing in the international shipping forum. The honourable member for Hume made much of Australia's standing in the international forum, and I agree with him. Australia has a good reputation amongst maritime nations. We are regarded as being rigorous&mdash;some say that we are overly rigorous&mdash;in inspecting foreign ships coming here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our Australian flagships are of a high standard. I believe that our reputation has been enhanced by the recommendations of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report, the majority&mdash;not all&mdash;of which have been accepted by the government. But what will happen to that reputation if we sell our fleet? It is essential, in my view, that we maintain the ANL as an Australian owned, Australian flagged and Australian crewed shipping line where people are employed under Australian standards and conditions. I make no apology for saying that. I will fight with all my ability to see that that is maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are we prepared to put the future of our trade in the hands of foreign shipping interests? Make no mistake: if we sell off the ANL, this is what we will be doing. Instead of talking about selling off ANL, we should be talking about investing in more Australian ships. If we were really serious about protecting the Australian maritime environment, there would be no talk of selling off ANL. We are more likely to be able to protect our environment if we are dealing with our own registered flagged and crewed ships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that there are recommendations in the proposed legislation about payment for the maritime damage. I have some worry about who would actually pay for the damage. I know the legislation makes specific recommendations. These recommendations are fine as long as the money is there. When we talk about a major environmental disaster, many millions of dollars are involved. Today, with the international markets as they are, it is often difficult to find out who owns a ship or a cargo. Ships and cargoes are traded on the international exchange like anything else. We often find that someone might own part of a cargo or a ship or have an interest in part of a ship for a journey or part of a journey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember people telling me about a ship which almost went down in Norway. The only words the captain had as the ship was going down were, `Big problem, big problem.' The authorities in Norway were trying to find out who owned the ship, but they could not find out. The only thing they could find was a fax number in Tokyo. This is the sort of thing that we are increasingly facing in international shipping today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The days when families owned the ships, treated the crew as part of the family and had a certain pride in maintaining standards and crewing have gone. Today ships and cargoes are traded. If someone owns part of a ship for part of a journey and that ship happens to go down and pollutes the Australian coastline during that person's part of the journey, who will pick up the tab? I know who it will be. It will be the Australian taxpayers. Those ships that are registered with a fax number in Tokyo make things very difficult. I know that we live in a technological age, but it is very difficult to get compensation out of a fax number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During recent years I have personally inspected much of the substandard shipping detained around Australia. Members of the committee that produced the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report were made familiar not only with the conditions of ships but with the appalling conditions the crews have to work under: starvation wages&mdash;and sometimes no wages at all&mdash;lack of food, physical and often sexual abuse. It is a sorry state of affairs. These ships are traversing the sea lanes around Australia. If we talk to the people in ports such as Newcastle or Port Kembla they would be able to repeat these stories. If we talk to the chaplains from the Missions to the Seamen, as I have many times&mdash;in fact, I am on the board of the Missions to the Seamen&mdash;they would confirm the conditions that many of the crew members, who are often from Third World countries, have to survive under. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people doubt that the Australian coastline is under threat they have only to recall that late last year the Indian registered ship <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">APJ Anand</EMPHASIS> travelled from Albany in Western Australia to Gladstone in Queensland where on inspection it was found to have 147 defects&mdash;and they were only the serious ones. I was asked to go to Gladstone, which I did, and I attempted to inspect the ship but I was refused permission to go on board. I have spoken to the people who have been on board and I most certainly had a look at the ship from the outside. It was in an appalling condition. This legislation is being brought in to make sure that if those ships do go down, or do pollute the Australian coastline, they can be traced to the owner&mdash;not that it would be too hard to trace the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">APJ Anand</EMPHASIS>. This is the sort of shipping that many are trying to open the Australian coastline to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also another issue in regard to shipping that, although not specifically covered in this legislation, is an issue that I do not think we have given nearly enough attention to: the disposal of the ballast water that many of these ships bring to Australia. There has already been danger. There has been great damage done to the oysters in Twofold Bay in New South Wales where the ships come in from Japan to pick up our woodchip and take it back. In Twofold Bay they dispose their ballast water, which was picked up from Tokyo harbour or from wherever they picked it up, carrying all sorts of organisms which get into the oysters. People have told me about the conditions of the oysters now in Twofold Bay. It is yet another example of why we should not be exporting our woodchip. I do not think that as a nation, as a parliament, or even as a government, we have given enough attention as to how ballast water is disposed of and the dangers that it is posing to the Australian coastline and to the marine environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been very fortunate in Australia that we have not had a major maritime disaster. We have had no <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Exxon Valdez</EMPHASIS> here nor have we had a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Briar</EMPHASIS> type experience, but we have had a few near misses&mdash;the most notable being the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS>. Every time we debate this subject we bring it up. The danger with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> was that it would have polluted a lot of the Western Australian coastline, and indeed wiped out the crayfishing industry in that area north of Perth. We have been lucky, but I wonder how much longer we can continue to rely on our good luck. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must keep our shipping lanes safe and indeed we must keep our shipping line. If we are foolish enough to sell off the ANL we will be opening the Australian coastline to the rust buckets of the world, and the number of these rust buckets will increase despite the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report and all other similar reports. The number will increase for the sheer economic reason that replacement ships are not being built anywhere in the world. Anyone who knows anything about shipping will say that within eight to 10 years there is going to be a major shortage of shipping throughout the world and there is going to be a major shortage of seafarers&mdash;and we are talking about selling off our own national line and the little bit of cargo that we carry. It is economic stupidity and must be resisted at all costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As other speakers have said, there is nothing terribly contentious in this legislation. It has given me a chance to present some of my other hobbyhorses, though. I have pleasure in commending the legislation to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are seven acts within this Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill that are subject to our scrutiny today and it is my intention to concentrate on one, the Air Navigation Act 1920, as it falls within the responsibility of my shadow portfolio. While we have already addressed the particular topic that is covered in this amendment in the Qantas Sale Act 1992, the opposition welcomes the additional amendment to make sure that Australia can enter into the world of international aviation competition with confidence that we will be able to maintain our services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was on 12 February 1992 that we decided that we should introduce a scheme of multi-designation on Australia's scheduled airline services. There are bilateral arrangements which govern Australia's rights to designate Australian carriers for scheduled services. Each bilateral arrangement, to which Australia is a party, in fact includes a clause under which substantial ownership and effective control must be vested in the nationals of the country designating the airline or airlines. Under that particular clause the country to which a designated Australian carrier operates has the right to withhold, revoke or even suspend operating permission if Australia cannot demonstrate to the other country's satisfaction that its designated airlines meet national ownership and control tests. The object of these amendments is to enable the government to ensure that any Australian carrier seeking designation, or already designated on an international route, can demonstrate its compliance with bilateral requirements that it is substantially owned and effectively controlled by Australian nationals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment in fact gives the minister the power to require information as to the shareholding of Australia's international airlines and the power to require a vesture of foreign airline shareholding in an Australian international airline where equity held by foreign airlines and aggregate exceeds 35 per cent, or where equity by a single foreign airline exceeds 25 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is probably timely that this particular piece of legislation be passed by the House. I say that for a couple of reasons. Firstly, we have already seen the sale of 25 per cent of Qantas Airways to British Airways. We are looking forward to the ultimate, although highly delayed, float of Qantas. The privatisation of the remainder of Qantas Airways does give foreign investors the opportunity to come in. That is where the 35 per cent shut off point comes in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were also interested to read in the last few days of a possible arrangement between Ansett Airlines and the German carrier Lufthansa. It has been suggested in some press reports that Lufthansa might be taking some equity in Ansett Australia. If that happens, we will also have that double problem: we will have some foreign ownership of both major carriers, Ansett and Qantas. There is also the possibility of a third international airline in Australia soon&mdash;if and when the funds can be arranged for that carrier to get off the ground and meet its obligations under the arrangements that have been made by the International Air Services Commission&mdash;to service China. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also seen evidence that some countries hold up the provisions of these arrangements very strictly indeed. The case comes to mind of the situation that developed with the privatisation of British Airways. Some major negotiation went on between the British government and the United States government on the rights of British Airways to operate into the United States; at one stage the foreign shareholding had slightly exceeded the 35 per cent mark. Also, there were major negotiations regarding the British Airways acquisition of a percentage of the US domestic and international carrier US Air. While I suppose one could suggest that they might have a little more to do with the bartering of air rights between the United States and Great Britain, British Airways could have been denied access to the United States if these procedures had not been under control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look around the world at the arrangements that are being made at the moment with the grouping together of airlines, at the commercial arrangements that are being made between numbers of foreign carriers, obviously there is room for some countries to object to the access of particular carriers into their country if these provisions are not met. Therefore, the opposition welcomes these amendments to the Air Navigation Act so that we can make sure any Australian airline operating overseas has the capacity to meet those obligations and thus avoid any situation where an Australian carrier is denied access to a particular country, otherwise we might be subjected to protracted negotiations. The opposition welcomes and supports these amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking today to the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill, I will concentrate on the amendments to the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983. This, I am quite certain, has been one of the main topics that speakers have spoken on this morning, and rightly so. I want to concentrate on what is happening in Western Port Bay, which is very relevant to this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, though, I agree with what the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) said of the ANL shipping line. To sell off Australia's only shipping carrier would be ludicrous. I think it was the Bruce government which tried to do that back in 1929-30. It got nowhere then, and I do not believe it will get anywhere now. We need our own shipping line. We are an island nation and it is important that we have our own ships, at least to know exactly what is going on in the shipping world with the transportation of our goods. We would be held to ransom if we did not have our own shipping line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Shell-Mobil Crib Point terminal handling facility at Western Port Bay is used by many Australian or ANL boats. Back in 1992, I started to oppose the use by Shell and Mobil of the old BP site there. I wrote to the then Minister for the Arts, Sport and Environment, the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly). A letter back from the then minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Approval of the project rests almost entirely with the Victorian Government, the only Commonwealth role being in the initial approval of the foreign investment for acquisition of the site. In considering that approval, the Treasurer has sought advice from the Commonwealth Environment Protection Authority, and has been made aware of the sensitivities of Western Port Bay with regard to the RAMSAR sites.</PARA>
<PARA>Ramsar, of course, is the agreement we have with overseas nations in relation to migratory birds. Briefly, what is happening at Crib Point is that Shell and Mobil are proposing to significantly increase the importation of heavy crude oil for the refineries at Geelong and Altona. They intend to do this in tankers&mdash;not their own&mdash;of around about 150,000 tonnes. Those tankers will be brought into Crib Point, which is a deepwater port. There they will offload half of the oil and transport the rest of it up Port Phillip Bay to their Altona and Geelong refineries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tanker traffic in the area will increase quite significantly. I think it is suggested that an extra 60 to 70 tankers per year will use Bass Strait and the confined waters of Western Port Bay. If this proposal goes ahead, it will mean there will be an extra 180 tanker passages between Western Port and Port Phillip Bay. Given the increase in the number of tankers that will be used, the risk of an accident happening must also increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics Report No. 70, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Major marine oil spills: risk and response</EMPHASIS>, 1991, concluded, amongst other things, that `the probability of one or more major oil spills occurring in Australian waters, from tankers, could be as much as 48 per cent in the next five years and 93 per cent in the next 20 years'. We are heading towards a 93 per cent risk of something happening. Just imagine what would happen if one of these tankers went aground at The Nobbies at Phillip Island at the entrance to Western Port Bay. It is not unusual for ships to be wrecked there; over the years many ships have been wrecked on the approaches to Western Port Bay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just around the corner from The Nobbies is a major Australian tourist attraction&mdash;the penguin parade. That is estimated to bring hundreds of millions of dollars into the Victorian economy&mdash;and, with Jeff Kennett there, we need hundreds of millions of dollars; we need every cent we can get. If it were wiped out&mdash;it could happen; we have had examples of hundreds of penguins being killed by oil spills just off the Otways&mdash;it would ruin this magnificent tourist attraction. It would destroy the economy of many people on Phillip Island and around Western Port Bay. I believe that it would even destroy the economy of Melbourne, because the Japanese tourists who flock to those particular penguin parades of a night would no longer go there. Therefore, the tourist trade would cease in Melbourne and on Phillip Island.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I am so adamant that this expansion by Shell and Mobil should not go ahead. At the present time they have put it on hold because of the pressure that has been put on them by various groups throughout the community in the Western Port area. Those groups have done a tremendous job, pointing out the dangers to this huge conglomerate of two oil companies. They are continuing to point it out and I think they are winning. I hope that Shell and Mobil withdraw from the proposal they are putting forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have asked continually that the minister request that an EIS be carried out in this area. That has not happened because there have been all sorts of problems. But I believe that legal advice has been given which says that the minister can direct the oil companies to carry out an EIS. Their reason for not carrying it out is that they went into an existing facility which started off down there in the early 1950s and was used by BP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The MARPOL Convention, which deals with marine pollution, I do not believe allows for land based clean-up. MARPOL and the moneys which are connected to it will clean up the sea based pollution&mdash;that is what is in the water&mdash;but what happens when it washes onto the land? Would that also be covered by this piece of legislation? Looking around the chamber, I can see some nods. I am glad to know that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe there should be a transportation levy placed on Shell and Mobil for shifting this fuel around. If they do go ahead with this proposed development and they shift fuel from Western Port to Port Phillip Bay there has to be a problem. There is a higher risk and therefore an oil levy should be placed on them, based on the amount of oil they transport. That would go into some trust fund, perhaps capped at a certain amount, say, $14 million or $15 million. When the contributions reach that level, then maybe the interest on that amount can be used for the Environment Protection Agency or for some research or something on the two bays. It is important that some fund is set up that can be used for rectifying any problem that occurs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that a fund is being set up at the present time, but if this goes ahead I would like to see a fund particularly for that eventuality. The oil companies can afford it. I am quite certain that another couple of cents on a tonne of oil would not break them, even though they would oppose it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Oil companies are actually importing oil from overseas and we are exporting oil. We are exporting it because of export dollars and we are importing it and paying more. Why they should do this is beyond comprehension. I realise that different sorts of oil are needed for making tar, bitumen or some sort of heavy road material, for example, which I believe we do not have in Australia, but I cannot work out exactly why we are importing oil that we can produce in Australia. We have plenty of oil here in Australia; we are finding it all the time. It is to do with export dollars and our balance of payments, and so on. I think a lot of it is to do with profits for some of our bigger oil companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area I would like to talk about, mentioned by the honourable member for Throsby, is the marine ballast. There has been quite a lot of talk about that. Recently in Victoria there have been outbreaks of various red algae in Port Phillip Bay. We are particularly concerned about the starfish that have appeared in Tasmania. The larvae of these starfish were taken there by ballast water. It is believed that if they were to be transferred to Victoria, Victoria's commercial shellfish industry, which is worth approximately $35 million a year, could be destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very easy for water to be transferred in the ballast of a ship. About 6,000 international ships come to Australia every year and 120 million tonnes of ballast water comes into Australian ports each year. That is a huge amount of ballast water&mdash;120 million tonnes of water being pumped into our ports all around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anything can be in that water. There is this starfish. There is algae from places throughout the world. There is seaweed from places throughout the world. All of that is going into our water. Australia has this barrier of water all around it, but, stupidly, we are introducing water from other countries containing particular types of animals and flora which will destroy our own. A lot more work must be done in this area to stop importation of these pests to our own waters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have seen the television items about the starfish in Tasmania. Who knows where they are going to end up? They have started off down the Derwent River and are heading out to sea, so it is not too far to come across Bass Strait. </PARA>

Are we taking concerted action? The most important time in a battle is the first couple of days. These things have been around for a couple of years. If we do not stop them soon, they will be out of control and there will be no way to stop them. I think it is important that a lot of money be put into that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the people who should put the money in are the people who actually brought the pests here: the shipping companies, the oil companies and the woodchip companies. They all should be hit with a levy straight away and that money should be put into research to try to rectify the problem. The people of Australia did not bring it in. I did not export any woodchips. I did not export any oil. It was the oil companies. They are getting the profits out of it and therefore they should rectify the problem. I would like that to be looked at fairly closely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed an advertising supplement to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Magazine</EMPHASIS> of 26 March 1994 relating to oil spills. I read it and thought, `Who is actually paying for this?' It was written in such a way that one would think those who produced it were having a go at the oil companies. But when I looked a bit closer I found that the people who actually paid for this are the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association; AMSA, the body set up by the oil companies to correct any spills; the Australian Marine Oil Spills Centre; Caltex; and the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development. All of that goes to putting up this fairly neutral story on how oil spills are not really that bad, how they can be fixed and how we all should feel warm and fuzzy about them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The supplement contained a list of spills that have occurred over the years. In 1968 the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Korean Star</EMPHASIS> spilt 600 tonnes off Western Australia. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Al Qurain</EMPHASIS> spilt 184 tonnes. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Arthur Phillip</EMPHASIS> released a slick off Victoria killing 200 fairy penguins. A slick is what I was talking about before. Can one imagine, say, 20,000 tonnes, which would not be unreasonable from a 150,000 tonne tanker, being spilt into Western Port Bay? I wonder how many fairy penguins would be killed then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sanko Harvest</EMPHASIS>, wrecked off Esperance, lost 700 tonnes of oil and 30,000 tonnes of fertiliser. That should be a good mix for the ocean floor. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> lost its bow in rough seas of Western Australia and spilt 17,280 tonnes. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daishowa Maru</EMPHASIS>, grounded in Twofold Bay lost 780 tonnes in 1992 and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Zera</EMPHASIS>, ruptured by a tug in Spencer Gulf, lost 300 tonnes of oil. They give that as the total of the amount of oil that has been spilt on our coastline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One that they also point out, which is most important and which the petrol and oil companies do not pay for, is that an estimated 16,000 tonnes of oil and petroleum products, equal to the biggest disaster in our history, are sluiced off our roads, driveways, parking lots and service stations and quietly released by industry or backyard mechanics. So 16,000 tonnes every year is being poured off into our creeks, our bays and then our oceans. Why should the petrol and oil companies not pay for this? Why should there not be a levy on them to fix this up? Why should we as consumers and users of the ocean and bays have to pay for the problems they create?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Esso in Western Port Bay did a nice little exercise recently. An article I have on the subject entitled `"Disaster" clean-up' stated: `Esso workers fight mock spill to test emergency equipment.' The article reads:</PARA>

<PARA>It was probably in the middle of the day, on a calm sea and they would have all been ready for it. I do not think oil spills happen in the middle of the day. I do not think they happen in calm seas. Western Port Bay has quite a strong tide. I bet this was done at a time when the tide was not running too hard. We are told these sorts of things to try to soften our thinking in relation to what will happen if one of these tankers goes aground in Western Port Bay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AMSA has a fairly large set-up, which is paid for by the oil companies, to try to solve the problems of oil spills. It claims that it can get anywhere in Australia within 24 hours, but it has not yet been tried. I would like to see the government stage a mock disaster somewhere and not tell AMSA about it to see how quickly it can get there. I do not think it will get there too quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The audit office is currently doing an audit report on AMSA. From what I have heard behind the scenes, there is a real concern about the effectiveness of AMSA to do an oil clean up. I am waiting breathlessly to hear what the audit report has to say about AMSA. The Auditor-General seems to be able to comment on anything these days and it will be interesting to hear what he has to say on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to touch on the imposition of fines on oil companies in relation to oil spills. In 1993 Shell was prosecuted. At the time the court case was under way, Shell was up for a fine of $125,000. Shell probably has a turnover of $125,000 a second throughout the world&mdash;I do not know; it is huge&mdash;so that fine would have been nothing. We have to have some decent teeth. If oil spills occur, we have to have harsh penalties in place to make certain that companies remember what they have done and take steps to rectify it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Companies claim that they are doing these things and that they are spending some money, but I do not believe it is enough. A separate fund should be set up which puts a levy on all these oil companies. This will ensure that when they do breach regulations and there is a spill they pay for it. How much is one penguin worth? No-one can put a price on it. According to this article, it is worth a few hundred thousand dollars. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to support the general thrust of the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) and to join fellow members of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, even if I have to be a little critical of the government on some aspects of its policy. This is an omnibus bill. However, I wish to restrict my comments to the two protection of the sea amendments which were included in the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As already mentioned by previous speakers, while these amendments will ensure that foreign flag polluters or so-called ships of shame are held accountable while in Australian waters, I also wish to highlight today the ship safety anomaly which, if rectified, could stop polluters from being allowed to operate along our coastline in the first place. I appreciate what the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) said about the need to have some sort of trust fund. I understood that there was one in place. If we get to the root of the problem, rather than trying to fix up the mess at the end, we might be more effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Act 1981 provide for the recovery of losses, damages, costs or expenses incurred by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority in the exercise of its duties to combat pollution of the marine environment caused by a discharge or disposal from a ship. AMSA's right of recovery would be limited to those parties which have been proven responsible for a pollution breach. Quite rightly, ship owners should be responsible for all forms of discharges from their vessels, from ballast waters, which, as the honourable member for Dunkley said, could contain harmful micro-organisms, to garbage and waste disposal and to fuel oil spills&mdash;all of which have a damaging impact on sensitive marine environments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second set of amendments deals with the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 and provides for the detention of foreign vessels suspected of causing marine pollution within Australian waters. The need for such detention powers over foreign ships can be seen in that the act allows legal action to be taken against Australian ships wherever they are. However, Australian jurisdiction over foreign vessels is limited to Australian waters only. AMSA should be given the power to detain foreign vessels that pollute, as Australian ships already face similar measures in foreign ports, including most EEC countries. Often the detention will only see the offending ship post a bond or security before sailing on&mdash;a sort of guarantee, if you like, until investigations are complete. I support the thrust of these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is, I believe, all about responsibility and making sure that the culprits pay. There is too much at risk, particularly in my electorate where there are busy ports operating on the doorstep of the Great Barrier Reef. As an example, let us take the port of Gladstone in Central Queensland, one of the most efficient and modern ports in Australia. Last financial year, 1992-93, it handled a record cargo throughput of 33.1 million tonnes valued at $2.8 billion, including 23.9 million tonnes of exports to 32 countries valued at $2.1 billion and imports from 12 destinations totalling 9.2 million tonnes worth $700 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Almost 700 cargo vessels visited Gladstone last year, carting such diverse cargoes as coal, alumina, grain, cement clinker, petroleum products and caustic soda. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would recognise many of them as potentially deleterious to the Great Barrier Reef or coastal environments. These vessels must navigate at least part of the way through the Great Barrier Reef, which is not only a totally unique and pristine environmental marine park but also the backbone of Queensland's tourist industry which generates billions of dollars for both state and national economies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the measures debated in the bill today allow us to detain and seek compensation from ships that pollute our waters&mdash;action at this stage is important but often simply too late&mdash;the damage has been done and the clean-up might not really compensate us for what has been done. Ideally we must stop these polluters or ships of shame before they damage our marine environment. We need to have a culture of vigilance and a mechanism of intelligence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to highlight a recent `ship of shame' story with which I am familiar and which was referred to by the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). It is something which we should be able to avoid easily in the future if the government decides to take some positive action. I have raised this matter in the House before but it bears reiteration, especially in the context of the acts which we are discussing today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This story involves an Indian registered bulk carrier, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">APJ Anand</EMPHASIS>, which set sail from Albany in Western Australia with a load of feed barley for drought stricken farmers in Central Queensland. According to vendors, WA Grain Pool and Grainco, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">APJ Anand</EMPHASIS>'s credentials as a carrier were satisfactory and the vessel was issued with a single voyage permit to cart grain around the coastline with no safety inspection required. Ironically, the vessel's generators were so underpowered that they required on-wharf supplementation in order to load the grain. Further, it was responsible for a minor oily bilge spill just before leaving Albany, which had to be contained and cleaned up by the local port authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the fact that no AMSA inspector was based at Albany at the time, the derelict <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">APJ Anand</EMPHASIS> was allowed to sail on. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">APJ Anand</EMPHASIS> arrived in Gladstone in late September, but this time it was unable to unload as its lifting gear proved to be defective. AMSA authorities were alerted and a full inspection on 10 October revealed over 120 defects&mdash;I understand the honourable member for Throsby now has it at 147&mdash;including extensive wastage, corrosion and other structural problems; poor crew conditions, which I saw photos of, and they were filthy; and substandard lifesaving equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">APJ Anand</EMPHASIS> was impounded. Repairs had to be carried out to the lifting gear amounting to some $80,000. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Anand</EMPHASIS> was later released and later allowed to sail off to Singapore for major repairs. The vessel was to have travelled on to Mackay, deeper into the Great Barrier Reef. That should again alert us to the danger of this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before we dismiss the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Anand</EMPHASIS> as just a one-off instance or one of a small number of substandard foreign vessels, there is another example of such a `ship of shame', one from the same shipping company, Pacific Rim Shipping Co. Pty Ltd. It had in its fleet another vessel of doubtful credentials known as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Marine Blue</EMPHASIS>. I concede that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Marine Blue</EMPHASIS> is not a totally similar case to a vessel plying the coastal trade. This vessel carried a load of magnetite from Chile to Mackay. Mackay is on the doorstep of one of the great areas of the central Barrier Reef. When it arrived in Mackay it was found to have a rupture in the ship's chain locker which had been flooded through a crack in the hull. The ship's pumps were faulty and it had to undertake lifesaving and firefighting equipment restoration and improvements to crew facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not allow maniacs on our roads. We do not allow semitrailers to run around with bald tyres. We do not allow tankers to spew out fuel onto our urban environment. Very tough conditions apply to tankers carrying petroleum and chemicals. That is fair enough. We all endorse that. The principles should be no less for vessels which ply the highways of the sea. A degree of responsibility rests with the flag states, the owners, the classification societies, the agents, the charterers, the insurance providers and the port and maritime authorities but the principal responsibility rests ultimately with this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lesson in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Anand</EMPHASIS> situation. It highlights the major anomaly in our ship safety regime. While foreign tankers must be fully inspected before being issued with single voyage permits to operate on Australia's coastal trade, such inspections are not a prerequisite for foreign bulk carriers. Yet these vessels, identified as the most at risk in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame </EMPHASIS>report, are left unscathed. I quote from the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The catalyst for the inquiry was the loss in close succession of six bulk carriers off the West Australian coast between January 1990 and August 1991. During the inquiry it became clear that the loss of bulk carriers is a significant problem, posing considerable threat to the lives of seafarers, international trade and the marine environment.</PARA>
<PARA>Although the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">APJ Anand</EMPHASIS> incident did spark a departmental review of procedures under the former minister Senator Bob Collins,  from the advice I have received from the new minister, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), it appears that nothing further will be done. I quote from my letter to Senator Collins at that time. I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In speaking to the parties involved in the APJ ANAND saga, it is known that the classification society's previous rating of the vessel was grossly inaccurate and misleading. I'm sure you'll agree, therefore, we need to strengthen our inspection procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Could you advise how the government proposes to address this anomaly in regard to the issuing of Single Voyage Permits for bulk carriers?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What additional resources has the Australian Maritime Safety Authority received since the handing down of the "Ships of Shame" report?</PARA>
<PARA>Sadly, when the new minister, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith, replied to that letter he did not address those matters. He took a fairly superficial view of the matter. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately the APJ ANAND is a symptom of an international problem which potentially results in small numbers of sub-standard ships participating in the Australian trade.</PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that for an environmentally sensitive government the damage from just one of these derelict ships would be just too high a price to pay. The new minister goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The long term solution to the problem of substandard shipping can only be achieved through international action by those having responsibility for ship safety.</PARA>

It is well and good to make those sorts of statements, but the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">APJ Anand</EMPHASIS> in our case was hardly an international problem when it threatened our coastline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not opposed to foreign vessels operating in Australian waters and I do not support any form of cabotage which might restrict competition in our seaways. Legitimate foreign vessels should not be made scapegoats for the government's failure to enforce its own maritime safety standards. As we have heard from the shadow minister, on the latest figures, ships of the Australian Maritime Association have been achieving savings on average of $217,000 per vessel per year in operating efficiencies. Then they have to turn around and lose $288,000 on average in petroleum and bunker oil excise. Those who would turn a blind eye to this form of government action on the one hand and then call for cabotage on the other are living in cloud-cuckoo-land. We cannot have it both ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a little like the situation in my own electorate, where we have a number of train lines under threat. These lines are struggling to maintain viability. Excise increases as of August this year will add $275,000 to the Gladstone-Moura line, raising its total excise contribution to $1.7 million a year or, in the case of the small and equally much threatened Maryborough-Monto-Gladstone line, $80,000 in additional excise for a total excise bill of nearly half a million dollars. One can see that there is a parallel case there. The government is demanding efficiencies on the one hand and then taking them away with the other in excise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I share the concerns of the honourable member for Throsby regarding the future of Australian flag vessels, the ANL and others, but his government might well look to the cost it imposes on Australian shipping companies.

However, returning to the matter before the House, we must take greater responsibility for the protection of our coastline. Tightening the permit system to include foreign bulk carriers is a positive step. I am disappointed that the government has decided not to act more positively but rather to rely on the existing inspection regime, the same system which allowed the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Anand </EMPHASIS>to sail through the Great Barrier Reef unhindered. It is my personal view that there should be a greater resourcing of AMSA. I am conscious of what the honourable member for Dunkley said about an efficiency audit. At the very least, if we are going to maintain the current practice of only inspecting 25 per cent of these vessels on average we should add extra resources to AMSA by way of intelligence gathering facilities and staff so that we can be ready for such vessels when they come to Australian waters.</PARA></TALK.START>

A number of changes relate to the way the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 applies in the exclusive economic zone.

It also clarifies the powers to inspect vessels in the economic zone and the express power to bring people into port, and generally tidies up some of the legislation that has already passed this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue raised by the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) in respect of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">APJ</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Anand</EMPHASIS> is one of major importance to this country. It goes to the core of the operation of ships of shame&mdash;of substandard shipping&mdash;not only in Australia but around the world. The critical issue is the fact that ships operating on the Australian coast, until the incident with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">APJ</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Anand</EMPHASIS>, were not subject to port state inspection. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">APJ</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Anand</EMPHASIS> had been in Australia some years earlier at the port of Geraldton, where the condition of the vessel caused major problems and the port authority had a great concern about it. The vessel arrived later at Albany. Because there was not a surveyor from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority there, the vessel was not subject to AMSA inspection, but its defects were noted and the next port of call was advised of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has led to the question of the inspection of vessels operating under single-voyage permits. We are looking at that in the current resumption of the inquiry into substandard shipping. We have had some information about that. I think it is fairly clear to most members of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure that vessels operating under single-voyage permits must be subject to inspection, preferably a mandatory inspection. The Australian Mining Industry Council has called for the mandatory inspection of all vessels operating on the Australian coast under single-voyage permits, so what I have just said is not something that is radical. It is not something that is tougher for Australia than what is being put forward by the organisation that represents the major users, the Australian Mining Industry Council. That is something we are going to come back to later as we proceed through the consideration of the evidence being brought before the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report, the very favourable response and acclaim that it has received across the world, and the momentum it has generated in trying to get rid of substandard shipping. There have been comments made at times that we, as an exporting nation, are being too tough on foreign shipping coming to Australian ports. They are put to rest completely by the consideration of the approach to substandard shipping going on in Europe and the United States at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was recently a meeting of the transport ministers from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, looking at stamping out pollution. They were particularly concerned about vessels carrying hazardous cargoes travelling their waters. They were looking at bringing in a new convention of liability for ships carrying hazardous and noxious substances, to be enforced by the International Maritime Organisation, by 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They also resolved that they would support research into the feasibility of identifying containers lost overboard. We had an incident with a lost container just a few days ago. The container was submerged, and a yacht struck it and was destroyed. Fortunately, everybody was rescued from the yacht. But containers that are lost overboard and remain afloat but are not always visible are a constant problem at sea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They also took a decision that ship surveyors in each of those nations that I have mentioned would be exchanging information. They decided that substandard ships would be detained, as they are here, until they are upgraded to meet the international maritime standards. They discussed a further amendment to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea to provide that ships carrying oil, harmful substances and dangerous goods follow predetermined routes. That is, the route to be followed by the master of a vessel in completing its journey would not be one of his selection but would be a prescribed route, similar to what we have on the Australian coast in some areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The European Commission only a few weeks ago brought forward very tough plans in respect of port state control. Anybody who thought Australia's approach to port state control and its level of inspection were tough, on reading through and reflecting upon what the European Commission is now proposing and hoping to have in place by 1996, and on what the United States Coast Guard is doing in respect of substandard shipping, would see that Australia looks soft. If anything, we are too easygoing; we are too soft in our approach to substandard shipping in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The developments from the European Commission and from the US Coast Guard are very welcome because they give a legitimacy to the sincere and deeply felt concerns of members of this parliament of both houses, of people out there in the community generally who are concerned for the welfare of seafarers from wherever they come. All of those people now will get some comfort from the fact that it is not a matter of Australia trying to do it by itself here; the major markets of the world, the United States and the European Community, are bringing forward tougher measures than even Australia is carrying out at the moment, so there will be some prospect of sweeping the seas of substandard shipping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The EC plans, for instance, to look at how to ensure that vessels visiting European ports meet the requirements and that oil tankers that are five years or less away from being phased out under the MARPOL rules, the marine pollution rules, and that bulk carriers over 12 years old will all come under increased port state scrutiny. The proposals they are putting forward will all go to the European Council of Ministers, the European Parliament and, hopefully, will be adopted by the European Union by July 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It touches also on the question of crewing of ships. It was said before that a good crew will save a bad ship in a time of crisis but a bad crew will destroy a good ship in a time of crisis. No matter the condition of the vessel, priority one has to be the competency of the crews. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one were to look back&mdash;and I will not take up the time of the House with it now&mdash;over the recent ship accident investigation reports that have been released on the competency of crews of a trawler that was sunk by a foreign flag vessel, one would see that competency of the crew and crew not carrying out their responsibilities were the key feature. It was not the structure of the vessel or condition of the vessel; it was the performance of the crews on both vessels. So surveyors will seek to ensure, when they carry out these port state control inspections under these new proposals for Europe, that crews comply with minimum training standards and are aware of their duties on the master list. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That goes to the core of the problem: the training agencies themselves are a motley collection. We know that the Philippines is a major source of recruitment of seafarers. But many of those seafarers carry phoney qualifications. A few of the training agencies do have world standing and do meet competency standards but many of them do not. There has not yet been sufficient response around the world to this question of ensuring that crews meet competency standards. We made recommendations in our report that there should be a standard set and approved by the International Maritime Organisation. That has not had the response from government that we had hoped it would have. But this issue is not going to go away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the previous speakers, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), referred to the shortage of crews and the shortage of officers&mdash;in total, about half a million by the end of this century. It is an enormous shortage. But what is happening is that farmers are going to sea. Effectively, on many vessels, we have seagoing labourers. Until the major trading nations of the world face up to this question of ensuring that crews are adequately trained, we are still going to have an extremely serious problem. I am very pleased to see that the European Commission in its recommendations to its ministers and to the European parliament is proposing that the competency of crews be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue that enables much of this substandard operation to survive and the dangers to continue to be created is the conspiracy of silence, as I like to describe it. I think it is most regrettable that in recent weeks the Salvage Association of the United Kingdom has determined that it will no longer release publicly the results of its inspections. It gives some reasons for that, saying that the number of vessels that it now inspects has declined considerably over the last decade. It expresses some reservation about the use to which that information is put. But to me, and I hope to this parliament, those excuses can be seen only as excuses. The effect of it will be to help cover up the abuse of seafarers, the exploitation of seafarers and the dangers of what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrast that with the recommendation from the European Commission, again to its ministers and the European Parliament, that each national administration be required to publish quarterly the number of detentions, including the names of ships, the International Maritime Organisation number, the flag state, the owner and the classification society which issued statutory certificates on behalf of the flag state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That will help do what we have recommended here and what the Australian Maritime Safety Authority here in Australia has started to do, and that is to get it all out in the open. Much of this abuse can happen only because peculiarly in the shipping industry everything is to be secret; it is commercially confidential. It is that conspiracy of silence, that cloak, that enables these abuses to go on. So it is great to see that the European Community, hopefully, will pick up this recommendation from the European Commission and move now to publish that information. The US Coast Guard already makes that information available on a regular basis. It does not have any problem with it. What the European Commission has recommended to its ministers is supported by the United States Coast Guard and the tougher still approach that it is taking to substandard shipping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me repeat that there is no case for anybody in this country to be offering some kind of puny excuse that in some way, by not turning a blind eye to substandard shipping or by enforcing our requirements under the Port State Control Convention, we are going to impinge upon Australia's terms of trade and our capacity to trade. Let the cargo owner who wants to use a substandard ship, a ship of shame, stand up, identify his or her business and product, and say, `I am prepared to create these risks and to endanger the lives of the seafarers on board that vessel to get the cheap rate that it offers.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is wonderful that the US Coast Guard is going even further than it has in the past and that the European Commission is looking to pick up the kind of measures that we recommended here in the parliament in December of 1992. The US Coast Guard is also moving to categorise those flag states which do not carry out their responsibilities as flag states. We know there are flag states that stand out as the home of substandard shipping: Malta, Cyprus, Panama. We could go on through the range of them. But what the US is going to do is to look at three-year averages on the number of vessels detained under those flags and publish that information. That will help put focus upon what is going on with a flag state and put pressure upon the flag state to carry out its responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The US Coast Guard is also going to enforce checks on flag states. What the head of the US Coast Guard, Admiral William Kime, has said recently is that a mechanism should be set up that would enable the International Maritime Organisation to certify the capability of flag states to enforce the various safety and anti-pollution conventions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our capacity to enforce measures relating to the prevention of pollution is one of the issues covered in this legislation. The recommendation from the US Coast Guard in respect of the IMO hopefully will do something about those flag states which see the registration of ships as an easy source of revenue. It is an easy source of revenue without having to carry any responsibilities. That is one good measure that has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another measure which I am greatly heartened by is the support being given to the view that I have expressed repeatedly: cargo owners are ultimately the people who trigger the use of substandard shipping. You can tie a substandard ship to the buoy, park it by the wharf, and it cannot do very much harm. Admittedly, the vessel can leak oil or whatever but, in relative terms, it can do little harm. It becomes a danger to those who work on it and it is a danger to the waters in which it travels when a cargo owner says that he wants to use that vessel. There are plenty of instances where the same cargo owners use the same type of vessel, obviously because it is the cheapest vessel that they can get. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures that I have proposed relate to cargo owners being held responsible for the operation of substandard ships. They unleash those dangers when they say, for example, `Yes, I will use the MV <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bendigo</EMPHASIS> owned by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid). It suits me fine. Yes, it has got a problem.' They take a deliberate decision to unleash the dangers and the risks involved in the use of that vessel. The article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Commercial News</EMPHASIS> dated 29 April 1994 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a cargo owner charters a ship that is detained for being unseaworthy, it is the shipowner who has to pay for it&mdash;but the law should be changed to penalise the cargo owner.</PARA>
<PARA>That statement has come from Roberto Salvarani, the head of the maritime safety at the EC transport directorate. I was greatly heartened when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a survey had shown that it was legally possible and technically feasible for cargo owners to be held responsible for the consequences of trading substandard ships by an EC directive or IMO convention.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, if we can get an IMO convention that will hold cargo owners responsible, it is a major solution to the problem. The ship will not have a cargo. It will not be able go to sea; it will go straight to the scrap yard.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Similarly, it will solve the problem if the European Commission, in respect of its own shipping, makes a direction. We are not Robinson Crusoe. We have been trying to do something ourselves in respect of shipping. Australia stands tall in the world in respect of the credentials of its seafarers, its standards in respect of shipping, the role that it plays in the International Maritime Organisation and the lead it and this parliament have given to the issue of the safety of shipping and the protection of the lives of seafarers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a nation, we can only benefit from a better standard of shipping. There may be a temporary problem in that some firms might be able to continue to utilise substandard shipping, but that is going to stop. When I started this speech, I mentioned the Australian Mining Industry Council statement. It believes that every ship operating under a single-voyage permit around the coastline of this nation should be subject to a port state inspection to ensure that it meets the required international standards. I support the legislation that is before the parliament and commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the legislation, in particular the amendments to the Air Navigation Act 1920 and the fashion in which they attempt to fulfil government commitments about producing competitive markets for international aviation in and out of Australia.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This whole issue of competition is very important in aviation. It comes from a broad government agenda about competition; it comes out of the Hilmer report. In telecommunications and the whole range of infrastructure provision around the country there are important gains to be made in productivity from having competition between infrastructure providers, particularly in the aviation industry. It is important to understand not only do we need good legislation to provide competition between airlines but also we need a commitment to competition between airports. The competitive structure needs to be right for aviation as an industry&mdash;for the planes as well as their destinations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) in a landmark speech in Melbourne outlined his important framework for achieving those goals. This is an issue that is very important to me as the member for Werriwa. When I contested the by-election, my leading promise was to establish an international airport at Badgerys Creek. It will be a very important competitor for the large aviation market currently serviced at Kingsford Smith in east Sydney. I mentioned this in my maiden speech. I cannot explain how flattered I was to have faxed through to my office later that day a press release from the shadow minister for tourism and aviation, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull). The headline of the press release said `Latham shows Labor the way on Badgerys Creek'. For a new member to be the subject of a press release from a shadow minister was indeed a flattering moment in my parliamentary career. The release went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has two choices if it wants to see Badgerys Creek built.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, it could fund the airport from consolidated revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope Mr Latham will continue to press his colleagues on this issue. While he may have woken up to the solution to this problem, the Labor Party remains crippled by inaction.</PARA>
<PARA>I have a sneaking suspicion that in a few hours time the shadow minister will have to draft another press release, this time praising this government for its very strong action on Badgerys Creek, the new Sydney west international airport. The shadow minister might also have to reconsider the matter of public importance he has listed about government administration of civil aviation, because there is no better way to administer the aviation industry than that being pursued by the Minister for Transport. His model for competition between airlines is reflected in this legislation, and his model for competition between airports is reflected in the landmark speech in Melbourne last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note also that there has been some media speculation about how feasible the international airport in Sydney's west will be. The argument fed by the FAC is that it has done a survey of all the existing operators at Kingsford Smith. Many have said, according to the hypothetical survey, that they want to stay at Mascot, defend their existing investments and downplay the role of a second international airport in Sydney. Of course, that is what they are going to say in hypothetical circumstances. The existing operators, posed that question, will always say, `We will defend our interests and our large investment at our existing location. We will downplay the role of the second airport.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to understand&mdash;this is a view shared by both sides of the House, I believe&mdash;that in a competitive market where there is a customer base infrastructure providers must follow their customers and cover the way in which competitors will break out of existing markets to establish themselves in large and growing markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A study in November 1993 by Economic and Energy Analysis and the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research in Melbourne showed that, by the year 2000, 26 per cent of air passengers in Sydney will live closer to Badgerys Creek than Mascot. That means there will be a catchment area for Sydney West international airport of more than five million passengers per annum. As well, one-third of companies exporting air freight out of Sydney will be located closer to Badgerys Creek than Mascot. That is, 48,000 tonnes of air freight per annum will be exported out of the catchment area for Sydney west international airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are quite significant figures because this will be the third largest aviation market in Australia after Kingsford Smith and Tullamarine. Quite frankly, no airline and no freight forwarder can ignore such a market. If they do turn their backs on that sort of market, they run a very high risk from new entrants in a competitive airline industry locating at Sydney west international airport, tapping into the third largest&mdash;and fastest growing&mdash;aviation market in Australia, and making substantial profits. Once the hypothetical surveys are put to one side, the truth is that according to basic market forces those operators must follow their customers to the very large catchment in Sydney's west and south-west. It is an outstanding initiative for the government and the Minister for Transport to introduce competition across the board for aviation and airports, and for the government to recognise the importance of these reforms, as part of the white paper process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For my region, in the south-west of Sydney&mdash;which has had high unemployment for a number of decades now, under governments of all persuasions, and a high proportion of long-term unemployed&mdash;this is a very significant day. It is the first time a national government in Australia has not only attempted to make the long-term unemployed jobs ready but also attempted in regions with high unemployment to make jobs available, to match up both sides of the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the supply side, the government is reconnecting people into the work force. On the demand side, it is making sure that important infrastructure projects&mdash;such as Sydney west international airport&mdash;in a competitive environment are available to generate tens of thousands of jobs. So the shadow minister will be drafting his press release, and I am sure the Minister for Transport will be very happy with the outcome that has been achieved in such a short space of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the benefits to employment, a report by the national institute in 1991 detailed the substantial employment benefits of the new airport through competition, with the creation of at least 36,000 new jobs in the region over the next 20 years. That means much more than jobs coming out of airport construction or out of airport operation. It is a major regional economic development opportunity, because of the cluster of industries that will locate around the airport site. That is, the government is using infrastructure policy and competition policies at a national and regional level to achieve jobs in a region that badly needs them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the catalyst of Sydney west international airport manufacturing will regard Sydney's west as an attractive place for the location of its activities and joining the export push from Australia, and also for tourism industries. There is a large and growing tourism market in Sydney's west, spearheaded by the Blue Mountains. The new airport, of course, with the international length strip, will facilitate the benefits of tourism growth in our region. So these are very important things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The study in 1991 also examined the discounted benefit of Badgerys Creek relative to the expansion of Kingsford Smith. It identified a net expansion of national GDP by $8.8 billion to the year 2010, which represents 2.5 per cent of our current annual output in Australia. The government is not only doing something that is good by the standards of regional policy, through competition between airports and in aviation, but also something that is, in its own right, a very important micro-economic reform for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are going to be moving away from an airport at Kingsford Smith which, by any standard&mdash;particularly international standards&mdash;is inefficient. It is congested, and is running out of room for its expansion. What next&mdash;the fourth runway? We already see forecasts, even before its opening, about the third runway reaching capacity by the year 2000. The road network around Kingsford Smith is much too congested, and the curfew at night is a hindrance to the airline operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All these things will be avoided at the competitor airport in Sydney's west. There will be state-of-the-art technology, ideal for freight forwarders wanting to join the export drive. There will be no curfew at night hindering the operation of freight aircraft. There will be no congestion around the road network at Badgerys Creek. It will be, by international standards, Australian's first advanced, and best-practice designed, international airport. That is a tremendous initiative for this government to realise as a micro-reform, making the economy and our export drive all the more efficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that manufacturing enterprises in western Sydney, which have been growing substantially, are looking forward to an efficient airport to give them their best possible chance of joining the export push. No longer will they have to battle all that horrendous Sydney congestion on the roads to place their produce at Alexandria with the freight forwarding companies. At present, they have to wait a couple of days until the order comes through, and then wait until there is a plane available and, when they do put it on the plane, there are delays at the airport. All the while their customers in Asia are waiting desperately for these goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will have in western Sydney a very efficient airport that overcomes all the problems at Kingsford Smith. It will also be very important for Sydney's urban and economic development, because there has been a substantial movement of manufacturing enterprises to Sydney's west and south-west. The government, following market forces, is facilitating further development of manufacturing by making sure that the international airport is there to efficiently carry goods to export markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can look at the figures for employment change from June 1992 to June 1993 in Fairfield-Liverpool and the outer south-west, which is part of my electorate. Employment grew there in 12 months by 29,000 jobs, according to the DEET figures. That was an employment increase of 16 per cent. The inner Sydney and inner western Sydney figures are the exact opposite. There was a loss of 19,000 jobs in those 12 months, a decrease of 9.7 per cent. The benefits for urban planning in Sydney are substantial. As long as I have been alive, the battle in western Sydney has been to get the jobs in place before the development of the housing estates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, of course, is the great objective&mdash;not just to lower the rate of unemployment but to produce a much more efficient urban area, so that people do not have to travel long distances, in cars which are polluting the air, to find their place of employment. We need a region that is self-contained in terms of employment opportunities. These are very good goals that the government would be supporting through an international strip at Badgerys Creek. They not only produce a micro-reform of substantial benefit, not only producing more than 30,000 jobs in Sydney's west and south-west, through industry clustering over the next 20 years; not only producing greater efficiency and environmental benefits in Sydney's west by reducing commuter times; but also, in the inner city, ending the way in which the FAC for decades has misled communities about the potential growth and noise consequences of Kingsford Smith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague in the chamber, the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), has led a campaign for many years to make sure that the FAC is kept honest, made responsible, and pushed into an environment of competition. For the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith, the Minister for Transport, to be able, after only five months in the job, to produce these results is enormously to his credit. It is a tremendous thing for him to have achieved for the inner city and the western part of Sydney, as well as for the region that I represent in the south-west. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to support from across the Sydney metropolitan area for this sort of initiative. I hope the aviation writers can break free from the FAC drip and have a look at the very positive way in which market competition can make a real difference. It must be understood that the catchment in Sydney's west is the third largest in Australia for aviation purposes, and no company, no airline, and no freight forwarder&mdash;away from the hypothetical surveys&mdash;will ignore that sort of market opportunity. If they do, they will not be in the market for very long, because the new airlines that are establishing, and some of the existing players&mdash;particularly in freight forwarding&mdash;will most certainly take up those opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can imagine how the next Compass in the domestic aviation market in Australia will not be messing around with restrictive trade practices on the counter space for Kingsford Smith, crowded out by the existing players. They will be straight out to Sydney west international airport, with equal opportunity on the airport design to market their services to the third largest aviation market in Australia. These opportunities reflect well on the legislation the House is now considering to make sure that not only domestic aviation competition works in this country, but also international competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FAC has developed a flawed model about aviation movements in Sydney. It is called the residual development model, and it is something like a glass of water overflowing. The unrealistic assumption is that there will be no demand at Sydney west international airport until such time as Kingsford Smith has saturated its capacity. That is to say, when they cannot fit one more plane on the runways at Kingsford Smith or deal with one more freight forwarding opportunity, then&mdash;and only then&mdash;will these operators look to Sydney's west and its aviation market which is bigger than Adelaide or Brisbane, and bigger than any airport in Australia other than Kingsford Smith and Tullamarine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, of course, is a model which any first-year university student will tell us is fundamentally flawed. Its assumptions are wrong, because it rules out any notion of market competition, and any notion of companies being aggressive or innovative. The FAC has no interest in any of the things we talk about in this parliament, how companies in Australia in the 1990s need to achieve to be competitive and strong. I suppose one can understand that. It is a monopoly itself: a monopoly that has never been exposed to market competition, except for Cairns airport, which is a tearaway success, as identified by the McKinsey report. That report shows that Cairns has done a lot better than the FAC airport at Townsville, and that it has provided the sort of economic boost that we will now see in Sydney's west. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FAC needs to bring itself up to date. It needs to read the Hilmer report, understand some of the basic rules of economics about competitive markets and how market forces produce benefits. It needs to break free of its monopoly shackles and understand that this is an airport well worth supporting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state government in New South Wales also needs to upgrade its point of view, because it has taken a very poor role in the planning process. The site at Badgerys Creek has been identified as the airport site since 1986, and in the eight years since then no state government has lifted a finger to do any of the basic planning&mdash;not for roads and not for rail. Nothing happened until the Minister for Transport took the initiative by putting in federal money for the road links and commenced federal planning about the rail links. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This airport can be operational by 1999. It will have an international length runway, fully serviced road and rail access, a growing manufacturing and freight forwarding market in Sydney's west, and 25 per cent of the passenger share of international traffic by the year 2000. All these figures are rising as Sydney's west and south-west continue to grow and mature as regional economies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The share of freight imports into Badgerys Creek will increase from 31 per cent in 1995 to 42 per cent of the Sydney market by the year 2020. The share of exports from Badgerys Creek will rise from a third in 1995 through to 51 per cent by the year 2020. The passenger share will go up substantially after the year 2000, kicked on by the enormous tourism boost from the 2000 Olympics. That is in recognition of the fact that a number of the sporting events are located much closer to Badgerys Creek than they are to Kingsford Smith. This sort of initiative brings together a whole range of reforms, including competition policy reflected in this legislation, better urban planning, better noise control, less congestion in the inner city and more jobs for Sydney's south-west. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude where I began on the historical significance of this day, by stressing the broad sweep of how this parliament and how governments in Australia have formulated economic policy. This government has spent a lot of time working on making the Australian economy more competitive. Now it turns its focus towards making the regions more competitive. It is backing sensible and well targeted, cost-effective infrastructure development like Sydney West international airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the first government to do that. It is the first government in Australia's history to have an effective agenda for regional economic development. It is also the first government to take an active interest in the benefits and the welfare of the long-term unemployed. It is making the training market and the training agenda more effective. It is reconnecting the long-term unemployed to the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On both sides of the labour market it is making the long-term unemployed jobs ready and making the regions jobs available. This is, by Australian standards, a major breakthrough for regions and electorates such as mine and for all those regions around the country that have been saying for many years that they wish to compete, and compete effectively. Come the end of today, we will be even more confident in Sydney's south-west of our chance to compete. It is reflected here in the legislation for international airlines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that Sydney west international airport will not only compete against Kingsford Smith but it will win the competitive battle.

I commend the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) for the amendments to the Air Navigation Act and point out that my constituents are in favour of any move to rationalise aircraft operations. These amendments allow the Australian carriers to comply with international requirements in accordance with our bilateral agreements. They also allow the act to address capacity arrangements in line with a deregulated industry and our bilateral landing rights agreements. I agree with my colleague that it is a pity that the Federal Airports Corporation was not all that interested in a deregulated industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill clearly outlines a definition of what an Australian carrier is and prescribes permissible levels of foreign ownership, safeguarding the growth of our air industry. The airline industry is a growth industry, as the member for Werriwa and other speakers in this debate have pointed out. I take the chance to remind the House that, even with the third runway at Sydney airport, future demands on capacity at that airport are very pressing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Airports Corporation's own projections of future usage of the airport at Sydney envisage a five per cent annual growth of traffic. Authoritative figures that are to hand suggest that in 1993 there were 21,087 landings and there were 4,472 take-offs on the north runway. After the parallel runway is developed the runway will be able to take 15,302 landings and 15,302 take-offs. The important thing to note with that five per cent annual growth is that the landings and take-offs will increase to 21,530 by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the worst case scenario&mdash;which often, the way the FAC does things, becomes the norm&mdash;is that, with particular weather conditions and a heavy load on the day, the north runway, the long runway at Sydney airport, could be in use for over 150 take-offs a day to the north of the airport, which equates to about one take-off every seven minutes. This is take-offs to the north of the airport, when the FAC and all the environmental impact statements and speeches that were made in the discussion over the last 10 years on the use of Sydney airport said that there would be very few take-offs to the north. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I and some of my colleagues, such as the member for Phillip, as she was at the time, now the member for Grayndler (Ms McHugh), the member for Sydney (Mr Baldwin) and Mr Michael Maher, who was the member for Lowe at the time, said that building the third runway and concentrating activities at Sydney airport were going to be a disaster, we were all said to be scaremongering and just saying this for political opportunism. But the FAC's own figures are now showing that, on a day when the weather is bad, we will get one flight every seven minutes taking off over people's homes. That is disgraceful and it puts the lie to all the things that the FAC has said in this debate. Its own worst case scenario is 150 take-offs a day to the north of the airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt the residents of my electorate and the other electorates surrounding the airport will be comforted by the government's statement later today, and the work that the Minister for Transport has done on seeing that we do something for western Sydney.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All through the run-up to the choosing of development at Sydney airport, we had the FAC saying, `Oh yes, we are all in favour of doing something at Badgerys Creek.' But what we find now is that it was doing just what those of us who were interested in this project said it would be doing&mdash;nothing. There was no planning for the road and rail infrastructure that would link Badgerys Creek airport to the city, there was no planning for the expansion of that airport&mdash;there was no planning for Badgerys Creek at all. What the FAC wanted to do was concentrate all its activity at Sydney airport. One would expect that ultimately we would have the only economic case put forward to us that it was interested in, which would be, `Well, Minister, the problem with Sydney airport is that we have got all this infrastructure and investment there and it is only being used 17 hours a day&mdash;we really need to get rid of the curfew.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Minister Brereton has done now in his proposals to have Badgerys Creek connected to the rail and road infrastructure of Sydney and in his proposals to sell off some of the FAC's operations will ensure that Badgerys Creek is able to compete with Sydney airport. As a non-curfewed airport, Badgerys Creek will be successful, in my view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FAC seems to think that Australia should go against the trends of everywhere else in the world. Any member or citizen who has travelled to the other large capitals of the world sees something entirely different from what happens in Sydney. In all the other large capitals there is a smaller 1950s or 1940s airport close to the centre of the city and the large international operator out on the city rim. In London there are two big airports, one at Gatwick and one at Heathrow; Washington has Washington National and Dulles and New York has La Guardia and Kennedy. Any of these large cities has two airports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FAC in its manic attempt to ensure that Sydney had only one airport searched the world to come up with an example of a city where there was a big airport planned by the government on the rim of the city that had failed. Such an airport was found in Canada, so the FAC said, `See, this is not a one-off; this is what happens everywhere.' However, the current official of the FAC is the chairman of the World Airports Association, and I am sure he would not be silly enough to say to the government, `Of course, these large airports on city rims have failed all around the world,' because they know it is absolutely not true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a ridiculous attempt to invent something that does not happen anywhere else in the world and concentrate all the activity on one of the smallest airports in the world. That is just not going to work, and the government and particularly Minister Brereton are going to make sure that that little plot is undone. The infrastructure that will be built to link Badgerys Creek with the city by the rail and road networks will ensure that that airport, if it is freed up from the FAC's grasp, will be able to compete with Sydney airport&mdash;and compete very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has also flagged the idea of selling Tullamarine. The minister really should package Badgerys Creek and Tullamarine together and sell them as a job lot. I think that there would be very great interest from large international operators as well as Australian operators in two airports that can serve the two largest markets in Australia, both of them being non-curfewed airports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is going to kill Sydney airport in the end&mdash;or kill the residents&mdash;is the struggle between the FAC to have the curfew lifted and the residents who want to have some peace and quiet. When you see that its own figures suggest that on bad days there can be a take-off&mdash;not a landing&mdash;every seven minutes over the suburbs of Sydney, that shows just how stupid the planning proposals were&mdash;not just stupid but scandalous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Badgerys Creek is opened up as Sydney's western airport, we will see the development of a very significant freight industry. At present some freight operators bring night freight into Sydney with the government licensing, in most instances, quiet aircraft. One operator bought some quiet aircraft&mdash;Ansett bought BAe146s&mdash;but then Australian Airlines, which is now Qantas, whinged and said, `Of course, we have not got any of those quiet aircraft but we have got some that are not quite so quiet and, in the terms of proper competition, Minister, you should let us fly these aircraft.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sad to say that recently a very stupid decision was made by the government to allow Qantas to fly 737s for night freight operation for a 12-month period. I can say here today that I am going to make sure that, when the 12 months is up, this period will not be extended. It is a disgrace that these people should be allowed to operate such noisy aircraft over the suburbs of Sydney throughout the night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Badgerys Creek is the perfect place for this. A significant freight operation will be able to operate from Badgerys Creek. International freight operators can come to Badgerys Creek in very large aircraft. It needs to be remembered that Badgerys Creek is at the centre of the growth area of Sydney. To be trying to develop all these aviation operations in a very cramped peninsula, 20 minutes from the CBD, is an absolute nonsense. In fact, figures show that Badgerys Creek catchment area will increase the total Sydney passenger market from 21 per cent to 32 per cent by the year 2020. That catchment area will be larger than any area outside the Sydney and Melbourne CBDs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FAC says that we should build an international gateway in Cairns and international airports in Adelaide, Darwin and Perth. But where there is a market that is bigger than all those markets, it wants to put down some little strip that will not even take small jet aircraft. That is a nonsense; it is stupid. It is not going to be sustained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes that Minister Brereton has put forward, and which will come into effect, will ensure that we get a bit of competition in the airport industry in Australia. Surely this other monopoly, the Federal Airports Corporation, should be opened up to competition, if the airlines tell us they are in favour of competition and if the government has told other GBEs that they should be open to competition. It has told Telecom that it should be forced into competition. As part of that forced change, there are some amendments to Telecom's legislation in this bill that are directly related to Telecom having competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is not much better. Its answer is to sell the Federal Airports Corporation; this replaces a public monopoly with a private monopoly. That is just as silly. What we need in this area is proper competition. One of the most competitive regimes that could be put together in Australia would be created if there were one owner for Badgerys Creek and Tullamarine. It could get into competition with this large government business enterprise which has been busy spreading half-truths around the country for so long. We would then see the proper development of Badgerys Creek and the movement of an asset to the people in the industry who can use it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is good enough to have airports in markets that are smaller than that market, it is certainly good enough to have a proper airport that can take international traffic at Badgerys Creek. It will ensure that the airport industry in Australia reacts as it has in the rest of the world, with a smaller, inner city airport, dealing with some international traffic but mostly with domestic traffic, and a bigger international operator out on the city rim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of my electorate and the electorates around the airport have no problem with Sydney airport being involved to a greater extent with domestic traffic. Domestic passengers tend not to want to fly at midnight or at 5.00 a.m., and the curfew can work safely there and not be of detriment to the operators. It can be a positive boon, in fact, to the people who live around the airport. Domestic jets are in the main not as heavy as and are less noisy than those of the international operators that are coming into Sydney airport now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FAC needs to comply with what it said it would do originally, which is have take-offs to the south and few or no take-offs to the north. The way to ensure that happens is to move the big operators out to the city rim. Let us have a decent, proper competitive regime and let us see that we get a bit of balanced development in the west of Sydney&mdash;and some sanity for the people who live around Sydney airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend this legislation to the House and congratulate Minister Brereton on his foresight which will ensure our transport and communications industries are given the scope they require to grow and, in particular, to compete in Australia's more and more internationalised marketplace. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;At the conclusion of this debate I thank the honourable members who have contributed during the morning and into the afternoon. Although this Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill contains mainly machinery measures, honourable members have taken the opportunity to express some fairly strongly held views in a range of areas in which they are, in many ways, quite expert. The preceding speaker, the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), for example, has a distinct and well-developed interest in the operations at Mascot airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I stated in the second reading speech, the bill does not introduce any substantial new policy measures and can be summed up as follows: some amendments to the Air Navigation Act will ensure that Australian airlines that are designated as international carriers under international agreements are substantially controlled and owned by Australian nationals. In fact, they have to continue to be that in order to be the designated national carrier. That comes about through the government's decision to float the ownership of Qantas. It means that Qantas, in fact, must have at least 65 per cent Australian ownership to continue to be described as the national carrier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also contains some amendments to the Telecommunications Act, which simply change the name to reflect the new trading position of Telecom and Telstra&mdash;as it is called in its international operations. There are some amendments to the Navigation Act which tidy up the validity of some exemptions to the act and particularly&mdash;and I think this is a very important one&mdash;give the maritime authority the power to collect the costs of cleaning up the pollution that is caused particularly by foreign vessels operating in Australian waters. We do not have any difficulty through our various schemes in dealing with Australian shipping in Australian waters, but the ability to collect the costs and force contributions to the fund from foreign vessels is tidied up in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a very interesting amendment which enables what we call community service obligations, the requirement of Telecom to make sure that people have access to the phone system and for the payphone system to be extended into the Indian Ocean territories for which Australia has responsibility, in particular, the Cocos and Christmas Islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, it is worth making one correction to the contribution made by the member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) when he was talking about the incident with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daishowa Maru</EMPHASIS> and referred to the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> supplement. It is of significance to note that with that incident there was not actually any oil spilt into the sea and so, while the incident itself was significant and highlights the need for our work in this field, in that particular case it was not one that led to actual marine pollution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the members who have contributed to the debate. I think the legislation takes us all a step further in all of these areas. I appreciate the fact that the opposition has allowed this legislation to pass without dissent on its part, so it is in fact a collaborative arrangement, and that is a good sign for the people who are involved and most particularly the people from the Department of Transport who have put their effort into bringing this legislation together. They too will be pleased to know that the parliament has supported it on both sides of the House. I commend the bill. </PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill makes amendments to a number of acts within the Human Services and Health portfolio. The amendments are largely of a minor procedural nature and are aimed at rectifying a number of drafting anomalies which have arisen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 2 of this bill amends the Disability Services Act 1986 to provide for the recovery of costs incurred by the Commonwealth in the provision of rehabilitation programs. It has been a longstanding practice in the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service to serve notices in relation to the recovery of rehabilitation costs on insurers prior to the settlement or conclusion of litigation between the insurer and the insured person. The amendment will provide legislative backing for notices to be served in time for the debt to the Commonwealth to be considered as part of the negotiations prior to the settlement of the compensation claim. Under current legislation there is no requirement for the party deemed liable to pay compensation to discharge the debt to the Commonwealth before paying the person receiving the compensation. This has led to situations where the Commonwealth has had to recover moneys from its rehabilitation client. The amendment will ensure that the insurer pays the debt to the Commonwealth before award moneys are disbursed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both amendments to section 23 will serve to strengthen legislative support for the recovery of costs by the Commonwealth for rehabilitation programs provided to clients with compensation claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the bill amends section 26 to require decision makers under part III of the Disability Services Act to notify persons affected by their decisions of the making of the decisions and of their rights of appeal. The Administrative Review Council has recently explored ways of improving a client's appeal rights. The council's advice is implemented through this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973, made by part 3 of this bill, are consequential to the Childcare Rebate Act 1993. The Childcare Rebate Act 1993 was another important step to ensure that child care is affordable for all working families. From 1 July 1994, parents using child care while in employment, training, studying or looking for work will be able to claim a cash rebate for part of their child-care expenses. An estimated 230,000 families with 358,000 children will benefit from the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth child-care cash rebate will be administered by the Health Insurance Commission on behalf of the Department of Human Services and Health. The cash rebate will be payable by mail or in person through Medicare offices of the Health Insurance Commission. To enable the Health Insurance Commission to begin preparations for the child-care rebate, the Health Insurance Commission Amendment Act 1993 was passed during the autumn sittings last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 3 of this bill makes further amendments to the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973, to ensure that it makes adequate provision in relation to the child-care cash rebate functions of the commission. Accordingly, the Health Insurance Commission will be required to prepare estimates of receipts and expected expenditure related to the performance of its child-care cash rebate functions, to expend its moneys in relation to those functions only in accordance with approved estimates of expenditure, apportion its assets appropriately, apportion its expenditure appropriately and open bank accounts required to enable it properly to handle its moneys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opportunity has also been taken to make technical and drafting amendments to the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 to facilitate the operation of the financial provisions of the act in relation to functions conferred on the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In part 4, the bill proposes a schedule of amendments to two acts. The schedule makes technical and drafting amendments to the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 and the National Health Act 1953, substantially to cast certain references in inclusive rather than sexist language. I commend this bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill is largely mechanical and the coalition will not be opposing it. However, there are a few points relating to the family and in particular to the many women whose unpaid `work' is largely ignored, especially the raising, nurturing and education of their children at home, which I shall discuss further in my speech. This comes under part 3 of the bill, or those aspects of the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 which are consequential on the passage of the Childcare Rebate Act 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really am very disappointed that the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) is not here. This is, of course, her first bill since she has become a minister and I had hoped that we might have seen her in here to discuss this bill, which has some very important implications for women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 proposes amendments to the Disability Services Act 1986, the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 and the National Health Act 1953. Part 2 of this bill amends the Disability Services Act 1986 by inserting a new subsection 23(5A) to bring the legislation into line with what has developed as common practice over the years in relation to the issue of early notices of intent to recover moneys to the person potentially liable to pay compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsection 23(7) is also to be amended to require the insurer who has been sent a notice under subsection 23(5) advising of the debt due to the Commonwealth relating to the rehabilitation program provided, to pay that debt before any payment is made to the client. Section 26 of the act is also amended by the inclusion of a provision relating to section 27A of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, the effect of which is to require decision makers to notify their decisions to the people affected and to inform them of their review rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service is responsible for the delivery of rehabilitation services to workers compensation authorities. These services account for 32 per cent of CRS service delivery and are revenue raising for the Commonwealth. The Disability Services Act 1986 does not allow for the CRS to claim payment for rehabilitation services prior to service delivery. In the past CRS has encountered problems attempting to recover moneys from workers compensation authorities after services have been rendered. As a result, this has often led to cost recovery from CRS rehabilitation clients rather than from the relevant authority. The amendments before the House today will overcome the past recovery difficulties and administrative delays by allowing CRS to claim funds from workers compensation authorities prior to service delivery for clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports this concept as the outcome will be a step towards better accountability of government revenue. The question of government accountability has, of course, a familiar ring to it. Already in this first week of a new parliamentary sitting we have heard much about the need for greater accountability in relation to the spending of public moneys. Yesterday's matter of public importance debate about the fraudulent use of funds expended under the Department of Employment, Education and Training programs highlighted the government's accountability problems. It is yet another demonstration of the government's inability to monitor programs and account for disbursement of funds. In the last parliamentary sitting it was its famous sports rorts affair. In the spring sittings it is a question of watch this space for the next example of extravagant waste of taxpayers money by a government which has lost the plot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier in my speech, I would like to make particular reference to part 3 of the bill which proposes amendments to the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973, consequential to the Childcare Rebate Act 1993. From 1 July  this year, a $30 allowance will be paid in lieu of the present dependent spouse rebate for those parents who elect to stay home to care for their children. For the 840,000 Australian families where one parent, usually the mother, is caring for children full time in the home, the government's initiative is a case of not all that glitters is gold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Keating government's lack of regard for the contribution made by parents caring for their children at home is demonstrated by the yawning gap between the child-care cash rebate&mdash;which is worth $61.20 per week for two children&mdash;and the home child-care allowance, set at a maximum $60 per fortnight. The 840,000 families across Australia in the latter category have a right to feel cheated. Their caring for their children at home is deemed to have about half the value of child care received by the 230,000 families who will receive the rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women who elect to stay at home to look after their young children no doubt feel demeaned as a result of this Labor government's action. These women are not being adequately recognised for their significant contribution to the family unit and to our society as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has always recognised the need for choice for families when raising their children. Unfortunately, with the cashing out of the dependent spouse rebate, the government has done nothing to extend support to those parents whose family priorities result in one parent staying home to care for their small children. This cashing out of the dependent spouse rebate and turning it into the home child-care allowance will not make a jot of difference to the ability of the average single income family's ability to provide basic necessities and to meet the cost of raising children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Work by the Social Policy Research Centre has demonstrated that families earning between $20,000 and $40,000 a year have been the big losers under Labor. Research by the Department of Social Security has shown that since 1983 when this Labor government was first elected a single income couple with two children on average weekly earnings is now nearly five per cent worse off in real terms. Other research studies have shown that there is no net assistance from government to families with dependent children. These families enjoy a real standard of living about three-fifths that of the rest of the adult working population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The non-means-tested child-care cash rebate makes having two parents in the paid work force, getting their two tax free thresholds and their means test free child-care rebate, the logical&mdash;perhaps essential&mdash;financial option. It may not, however, be the better option for their family's non-financial welfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue of the right of choice keeps recurring. When parents would prefer to have the opportunity of continuous close personal contact and interaction with their young children, watching over their developmental stages as they grow but are deprived from doing so because government financial policies impact on them, Australia's families are not being well served. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Keating government discriminates against families with one income compared with those families who have both parents in the work force and who are eligible to receive a child-care rebate of up to $61 per week for their children in external child care. It is a monstrous inequity which demonstrates no regard for those parents who sacrifice their income and financial independence to stay home to nurture their children at a critical time of their children's development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the home child-care allowance is also income tested. An at-home parent cannot have income of more than $282 a year before losing this new benefit at a rate of $1 for every $4 of income. So a second-income parent who earns $282 a day or $282 an hour is eligible for $61 per week child-care rebate but a full-time parent will start to lose the home child-care allowance with an income of a miserable 78c per day. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The message back in the late 1960s and early 1970s was one of the right of choice for women of not being put into a particular mould, of rejecting the assumption that once they married they must have children and they must stay at home and look after those children full time or else they were unnatural women. The situation now seems to be a 180-degree turn which indicates that the arguments that were being put forward in those days have never been understood in all the intervening years. We have it encapsulated by those child-care financial provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make it absolutely crystal clear that the coalition stands for free choice. It is not opposed to the child-care cash rebate. In fact, it advocated it in the 1984 federal election and has done so in every election since. It would make fascinating reading indeed to go back over the statements of various Labor Party ministers and private members in the intervening years to find out why there could be no rebate where there were two parents in employment.

She is on the record time and again, particularly as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, as saying why one could not have a rebate for child-care costs when those child-care costs were related to earning an income. The statements are legion. Those statements are, of course, now flicked aside and not referred to at all by the government. There is no attempt at justification of why it has taken over 10 years for this government to recognise that child-care costs can be a necessary expense of earning an income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat, the coalition has long since recognised that need in its policies and went to the election 10 years ago on policies to that effect. So we are not opposed to the rebate. What we are opposed to is the situation the woman who chooses the other option&mdash;which was the so-called traditional option&mdash;is now put into, and how she is treated in contrast to the career woman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things this bill does is fix up some sexist language and makes the language in the acts gender neutral. I thoroughly approve of that, let me make that very clear. I was very careful in the earlier stages of this speech to be gender neutral in my language. I am now not being gender neutral because in most cases the parent staying at home is the mother and I am presently focusing on that fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is highly relevant that we have this debate at the moment, because there is a lot of debate also going on about the subject of women in politics. I have really been itching for the opportunity to say this. The trouble we have with the subject of affirmative action or encouraging women into parliament is that, to this very day, the contribution of the full-time wife and mother is still regarded as zero by this community. That is the problem that women have at preselection councils. One of the government members opposite is nodding her head in agreement; it is the honourable member for Bass (Mrs Silvia Smith). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were to look at the profile of the women in this parliament, we would find the following facts. A number of those women are not married and have no children. A number are married and have no children. A number of the rest married, had children, and&mdash;when their children were of a certain age, an age of independence&mdash;came into parliament. That tells you something. I came in comparatively young, and childless. All the women who have come in here at an age on a par with men have come in childless. The honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Ros Kelly) is the exception: she had children after she became a member. A profile of the women in parliament will also show that very few of them came in here without having subsequently pursued a professional career of some kind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing that irks me, despite my being a non-traditional woman, and irks those women who are, is that the political parties pay absolutely no regard to the abilities that are demonstrated by the woman who is the full-time homemaker, rearing children and keeping house. This is indeed the real struggle. Such women are not regarded as professional people by their political parties. Their backgrounds are considered to be irrelevant in terms of a recommendation for service in the nation's parliament. That is the issue that the parties must address, whether through quotas&mdash;in the Labor Party's case&mdash;or through the leader's support, in the Liberal Party's case. It is an issue, furthermore, that society must also address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The really sad thing about this child-care funding change is that it has only taken the step of recognising that caring for children is important in our community. If a decision to work means that children must be put into paid child care, then it certainly should be recognised that that expense is a necessary part of that parent's going to work and it is recognised through the child-care cash rebate. However, what it still has not recognised is that child care by a parent, usually the mother, is as valuable to society. Until that is done, then none of us women, whatever our background&mdash;whether professional women, childless, or whatever&mdash;has made real pro</PARA>
<PARA>gress. That must be recognised. That is the bottom line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, what women were reacting against, starting in the 1960s and through into the 1970s, was being shoved into a mould where a woman was not considered normal if she did not marry and have children, and then stay home and look after them full time. We pushed for the right of choice and we said that, in the case of certain families, the option of the second parent&mdash;the mother&mdash;going to work could be better for a family, and that each family had the right of choice. What I have objected to here today is the financial penalty when the family decides that the better decision is for the second parent&mdash;usually the mother&mdash;to stay at home and look after the children, but does not then have the equivalent financial support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This principle was established some time ago. Back in 1977 or 1978, the Fraser government abolished the child endowment payment which went to the mother, and replaced it with the family allowance, a very much upgraded and higher income for the mother. At the same time, it abolished the dependent child rebate. The rationale was perfect: the dependent child rebate had been paid to the parent who did not have prime responsibility for the rearing of the family's children; it went to the taxpayer, the father. Abolishing it, and moving it across to the family's child rearer&mdash;cashing it out, as it were&mdash;to supersede the child endowment payment meant that the parent who was doing the child caring and rearing got the benefit of that rebate thereafter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill, of course, cashes out the dependent spouse rebate with the same rationale. I have no difficulty with that rationale. The rationale is the same. But in the previous process&mdash;of cashing out the dependent child rebate&mdash;a couple of important things happened, and they were stated at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the big winners were those on low incomes because the actual amount paid to them was not linked to income. It was the same for all families. People were not rebated according to their rate of taxation; they were rebated a set amount. So there was some financial equity there. The benefit paid did not depend on the amount of income earned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point of equity was that the family allowance recognised the economic contribution to this nation of child rearing. In those days, children were looked after much more in the home than through the child care arrangements that we have these days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are very important principles. They are principles that were broken by the Hawke government when it means tested the family allowance. I objected to that means testing at the time, as did the opposition. Family allowance thus became the only benefit&mdash;other than Austudy&mdash;that was means tested according to the income of somebody other than the person receiving the benefit. It was an offensive principle. The wife's payment&mdash;the mother's payment&mdash;was means tested according to the husband's income. As I said, the only other case where that happens is Austudy, which necessarily incorporates principles of dependency. The Fraser government's family allowance never incorporated principles of dependency. It was a principle of contribution. It acknowledged the principle of doing something worthwhile&mdash;child rearing&mdash;being recognised through the government revenue system. The Labor government means tested it, however. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask all honourable members in this parliament, particularly the female members: how would they feel if their salary was set according to what their husband's salary was? How would the men here feel if their salaries were set according to what their wives' salaries might be outside parliament? It is not a principle any one of us accepts as individuals. We all expect to receive remuneration according to the job we are doing and by an objective measure, and that is what the family allowance used to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, Labor means tested it and decided that, because some women had husbands of an income of a certain level, those women's contribution in the full-time mothering role was to no longer be recognised, or was to receive less recognition. That is utterly obnoxious on principle. Family allowance was never a welfare payment under a Liberal government. I repeat that it was a cashing out of the dependent child rebate, a transfer of child endowment into what was at the time stated, in words of one syllable, as a recognition of the value of the child-rearing role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, if a parent wanted to then put the children into child care&mdash;the family allowance was not paid only to people who were full-time parents&mdash;and use that money to pay for child care, that was their choice. And that was the correct principle. All speeches by Liberal, Labor and National party parliamentarians at the time recognised and supported that principle. It was the Hawke government that moved away from it and got us into this real muddle of principles that we have at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The family allowance has gone. It is now the family assistance supplement, which is means tested, and goes only to families in need. I have no problem with special payments to families in need. The Fraser government brought in the family income support payment, which was additional to family allowances, to assist low income families. That payment was also put into the family assistance supplement. We no longer have the family allowance. We no longer have a recognition that child rearing benefits everyone, and should be supported by this community. That recognition has gone under Labor. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead we have a child-care rebate, which we support, and the cashing out of yet another rebate&mdash;the dependent spouse rebate&mdash;for the home child-care allowance, which is not good enough. Whilst I take no objection to government members, men or women, saying nice things about the child-care cash rebate&mdash;we support it and it should be supported&mdash;it is incumbent on members of the government, particularly women members, to go back to the government and ask, `Are we fair dinkum about the importance of child care? Why is it so much more important when someone other than a parent does it? Why is it that we will give this sort of recognition to someone who is paid to do it as a job, yet we give such puny recognition to a parent who does it? Is child care of value or is it not? If it is of value, why is it financially downgraded when it is done&mdash;usually&mdash;by the mother?' Let us face it, 90 per cent of the time the value of what we do in our community is measured in money. The contribution we are making for the work we do is measured by the financial return we get. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat: a parent who stays at home to look after the children and who gets an income&mdash;not necessarily earns it&mdash;from, say, shares or a savings account starts to be financially penalised when that income exceeds 78c per day. Either the job they are doing is of value and is therefore financially recognised, without a means test, or it is of no value. The child-care rebate to parents who work outside the home is not means tested. I would certainly support neither of the payments being means tested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the beginning, the coalition supports the bill because it approves of what is happening in the area of rehabilitation in terms of proper financial administration and recoupment of government expenses, and approves of the child-care rebate. However, we differ on some very significant points which go to the principle and the detail of the government's child-care provisions&mdash;not least how they reflect on the real status of women in Australian society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to participate in this debate and to support the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill. I am also pleased to have the opportunity to follow the comments made by the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), some of which I agreed with, some of which I will disagree with. I will reiterate the main points in this legislation and then turn to some specific parts of it and respond to some of the comments that were made by the honourable member for Moncrieff.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation will amend two or three acts. Firstly, it will amend the Disability Services Act 1986 where it talks about recovery of costs of rehabilitation programs provided by the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service. The amendment to section 23 of the act will cover the capacity of the Commonwealth to recover compensation. The amendment to section 26 of the act relates to a client's right to have a decision reviewed by the secretary and to the right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An amendment to section 23(5) brings this legislation into line with what has been common practice in the government for many years. It has been the practice to serve notices in relation to the recovery of rehabilitation costs on insurers prior to the settlement of the litigation between the insurer and the insured person on the basis that the insurer is the person liable to pay compensation referred to in the act. It is accepted that no payment would be received until the court case has been settled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legal advice indicates that, under section 23(5) of the act, notices should not be served until it has been determined by a court or by agreement between the parties that the insurer is liable to pay compensation. The Attorney-General's Department has been consulted in the formulation of this amendment. Its advice supports the need for this legislative amendment. A number of other amendments are outlined in this amendment bill to the Disability Services Act that achieve tidying up changes and bring the legislation into line with the accepted practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other major section of the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill relates to administrative changes to the financial provisions of the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973, which enables the Health Insurance Commission to be involved in the payment of the child-care cash rebate system. These amendments are complementary to the Childcare Rebate Act 1993, which introduced this new payment. It is within this context that I would like to make most of my comments this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I will respond to some of the points made by the honourable member for Moncrieff. Once more, she has been guilty in her comments of only selectively outlining some of the provisions of the Commonwealth in support of families. She has indicated that she feels there is a yawning discrepancy between what we are paying in the home child-care allowance, which is a $30 per week payment, to the spouse remaining at home for the care of children and what we will be paying in the child-care cash rebate system, which is up to a maximum of $61. She claims that this shows a huge discrepancy and discrimination against those families where one spouse remains at home and cares for the family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> However, the honourable member failed to talk about all the other components of the government's comprehensive program of support for families. There is a great discrepancy in her argument because she failed to talk about what we provide to families in recognition of the important role played by the spouses who remain at home and care for children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The government recognises the important contribution to society and to the economy of the unpaid work undertaken by those people who remain at home caring for children. It is recognised that in the vast majority of cases those people are mothers. The government also acknowledges that the skills of women with work force experience are also extremely valuable in an economy dependent upon the training and flexibility of the work force. So it is a question of getting the correct balance between the two competing needs within our economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In properly assessing the impact of Commonwealth assistance for families, it is important to consider all of the allowances that we provide to families. The honourable member for Moncrieff talked about the home child-care allowance. What she has outlined is correct: it replaces and increases the dependent spouse rebate for families where one parent is caring for the children. Instead of the previous tax rebate being a tax concession that goes to the working partner, the taxpayer, we have now changed it to being a weekly payment to the carer of the child or children in the home. It will assist those families whose tax liability was previously too low to get the full value of the dependent spouse rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The home child-care allowance and the Commonwealth child-care cash rebate, which we are ensuring is implemented through this amendment today, will assist families with children, whatever their employment status. They respond to work force participation patterns, which suggest that today most women will spend some time in the paid work force and some time at home caring for their children. The child-care cash rebate will be of great assistance to many women seeking to re-enter the work force through retraining or education. The home child-care allowance will be claimed by women leaving the paid work force to have children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1983 the government has substantially improved assistance to low income families with children, including single income families. For example, between 1983 and 1993 additional family payments for children in low income families increased in real terms by 75 per cent for a child under 13 years and 147 per cent for a child aged between 13 and 15. Rent assistance has also been extended to low income working families. In particular, these payments go to those families where there is a single income. They are very much a direct cash contribution and cash support to those families where one member of the partnership has remained at home to care for children. This support is paid to families with incomes under $60,000, with greater assistance targeted to lower income families with incomes less than $25,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All family payments are now indexed automatically to account for changes in the cost of living. A large number of families receiving the additional family payment are single income couples. Many of these have previously been on higher incomes. They now receive additional assistance when one partner leaves the paid work force to care for a child and, therefore, has a reduction in income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us examine a family earning $35,000, with both partners working&mdash;one earning $20,000 and one earning $15,000&mdash;renting privately and caring for one child under 13. If that family had another child and the partner earning $15,000 withdrew from the work force, that family would receive nearly $123 per week in tax-free family payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite incorrect for the honourable member for Moncrieff to make out that the only payment that this government makes to those families where one partner withdraws from the work force to remain at home caring for children is the $30 a week home child-care allowance. A much larger amount of money is paid through the family payment system. In addition to that $30 a week home child-care allowance, these families would qualify for $123 in family payment, making a total of $153 per week, tax free, in child related assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The home child-care allowance is expected to assist 840,000 families, at a total cost of $1.13 billion, which is $230 million more than we currently pay through the dependent spouse rebate. That is an additional $230 million a year that the Commonwealth will be providing to support those families where one partner remains at home to care for children. About 55,000 families who were not eligible to receive the dependent spouse rebate will now be eligible to receive the $60 per fortnight payment of the home child-care allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The home child-care allowance is also much more responsive to families whose circumstances change during the year, since it is based on current income rather than on income in the previous financial year, which was the way in which the dependent spouse rebate worked. This flexibility is expected to assist up to 120,000 families whose circumstances change within any given year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When combined with the home child-care allowance, family payments make up a comprehensive package of support for families with children. The government will continue to provide access to child care for parents out of the paid work force for respite and occasional care. In addition, the government has increased child-care assistance, formerly known as fee relief, for occasional care. These forms of care are an essential service for women caring for children, as they allow them time to go shopping, to involve themselves in community organisations, or to attend to important family commitments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will also provide an additional $1.5 million over the next three years to support the establishment of some 3,000 new playgroups, which will benefit an additional 50,000 families&mdash;all of those being families where one partner remains at home to care for children. Some single income families will also be eligible to receive this new child-care cash rebate from 1 July in circumstances where dependent spouses are paying for child care to enable them to study, train or look for work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In her comments this afternoon, the honourable member for Moncrieff claimed that the government is restricting choice for women and that we are discriminating&mdash;she used that term and a lot of other emotive language to describe our actions in introducing the home child-care allowance and the child-care cash rebate&mdash;in favour of those families where both partners work, and that we are discriminating against those families where one person remains at home to care for children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She says that, during her formative years in politics when she was actively involved in the women's movement, she sought to assert the right of women to have a choice. That is certainly the position of this government. But we are trying to achieve effective choice where, if people wish to re-enter the work force, we assist them in doing that. We are doing that in a whole range of measures, not just in the support that we provide in our child-care programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Moncrieff failed to outline that, all through the 1950s, the 1960s, the 1970s and the early part of the 1980s, it was largely coalition governments that were in power. They had the opportunity to introduce some of these measures and failed to do so. From 1949 to 1983, apart from three years of Labor government, coalition governments were in power. They did not move to introduce any of these alleged new major improvements, as coalition members are now urging the government to do, to support families in the home. That is the direction that we are taking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member has some hide coming into this place and attacking the Labor government for the introduction of the programs that we have put in place that support both kinds of families&mdash;families where one partner stays at home and those where both partners are at work&mdash;when her party, which was in government for 31 out of 34 years, failed to take any such action to support them and has failed to demonstrate any capacity to deliver the types of support for families in the home that she is now urging this government to undertake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Moncrieff also expressed her strong disagreement with the government's policy of introducing a means test on family payments. She made much of the fact that she believes family payments should go to all families regardless of their income because, by introducing a means test, we are making the carer&mdash;the partner who has no formal source of income&mdash;answerable to the partner who has a source of income when the carer seeks to get family support payments from the government. She is suggesting that we should not put a means test on family payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Family payments are designed to assist families in meeting the additional costs of bearing children and raising them to adulthood. They are designed to bring about some equality between those families which have no children and those that have children, and to assist them with the additional costs of raising children. But, as a government, we have not got an unlimited pool of money and we cannot provide those family payments to every family regardless of their source of income. If we did that, we would have to raise taxation levels, which would impact negatively on low and middle income families and take away a lot of the benefit that we gain from family allowance payments. It is a nonsense to suggest that families that earn $100,000, $200,000 or $300,000 a year in income should be eligible for family allowance payments. Family allowance payments are designed to assist families that do not have sufficient income to meet the needs of raising children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an absolute nonsense for the honourable member for Moncrieff to suggest that we should have no means test whatsoever on family payments. It is a particular nonsense when she has been the one to lead the coalition charge in attacking us because we did not put a means test on the child-care cash rebate. I wish the honourable member would work out exactly what her position is on this matter. When we introduced the child-care cash rebate, she attacked us for not putting a means test on it because it is a much more limited program targeted at a much more restrictive audience. We did not impose a means test on that, but she is now saying that it is wrong for us to impose a means test on family payments. So I do not know what she expects us to do. She attacks a means test in one area and then says that we should have imposed a means test in another area, both concerning family payments and designed to support families in the costs of raising children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initiatives outlined by the government in the area of child care have been major. This government has been responsible for significant improvements in offering women a real choice as to whether they wish to remain in the home or enter the work force. I agree with the honourable member for Moncrieff that this community does not give sufficient recognition to the contribution women make in unpaid work in both the home and the community. I believe it is long overdue for us as a community to give much greater recognition to that. The home child-care rebate will go some way towards achieving that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly support the belief of the honourable member for Moncrieff that, within the preselection processes which parties go through in determining the eligibility of people to stand for election to local, state and federal governments, political parties should give much greater recognition to the unpaid contribution that women make in the home and the community and that unpaid work should be given equal, if not greater, value to that of paid employment when determining the contribution women make in our community and, therefore, determining their eligibility for selection as candidates for the various political parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments to the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 that we are discussing today are important. I am pleased that the coalition is supporting the whole of the bill. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me a great deal of pleasure to support my colleague the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) today. Any study of Australian families today shows that there has been a significant dramatic difference compared with the families of twenty years ago. Many more women are in the work force. They are either part-time or full-time employees or running their own businesses. Women today are much more orientated towards a career that will take them through their full working lives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past five years, the growth in women's labour force participation has been about 4.5 per cent. Now more than 50 per cent of women with young children are in the work force. More importantly, the future growth of the Australian economy and the living standards of Australians will benefit from women's participation in the labour force. However, most women have different work force patterns from men. They can expect to have periods of their lives where they are out of the paid work force or working part time. Many women also need time to retrain or upgrade their skills because the nature of our work force changes as industrial needs change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The stress of combining changing patterns of work and family and community responsibility is falling heavily on women. Women are reshaping their lives and the government must respond to their needs. Child care is essential to give women choices as to how they combine work and family responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the facts to be taken into consideration is that child care is now a common experience for large numbers of Australian children. Some can expect to spend up to 12,000 hours of their early years in paid, formal child care&mdash;as much as all the time they spend in primary education. That is why it is absolutely vital that children receive quality care in these important formative years and that parents do not have to worry about how their child is being cared for. </PARA>

This government believes it has a responsibility to parents to ensure that this quality, affordable child care is available. It is a point of pride that the child-care policy of this government is the most comprehensive and integrated ever adopted in the history of Australia. Its focus is on helping relieve work and family pressures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the national child-care strategy we have made a solid commitment to meeting the demand for child-care places by the year 2000. An extra 29,000 new child-care places were funded in 1993-94 and the number of child-care places has quadrupled, from 46,000 in 1983 to almost 200,000 today. A target of 300,000 places has been set, to be reached by 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government's record in building new child-care places is outstanding. It is important that the pace of growth is continued so that women have the confidence that they can find a child-care place when they need it. The government has also introduced a generous fee relief system which now assists two-thirds of families who use Commonwealth child-care centres. It is appropriately targeted to lower income families. We have a needs based planning system to make sure new child-care places go where they are needed most. Over three years $5.3 million dollars is being allocated to support an industry based national accreditation scheme for child-care centres. When this is fully operational, extra funding will be available for training and resource centres participating in the scheme. There are also initiatives which encourage employers to assist with the child-care needs of working families. The government already provides child-care assistance to almost 10,000 employer sponsored child places and existing tax benefits have encouraged the provision of many more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Research shows that children are likely to be sick as often as nine or 10 times a year, with the period of illness usually ranging from three days to a week or more. This load falls particularly on working mothers. The provision of child care for employers supports demonstrable productivity benefits, including the reduction of absenteeism and the retention of skilled staff. Employers are thus the major beneficiaries of child care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has also expanded services for children with special needs, whether they are from non-English speaking backgrounds or with disabilities or simply live in remote or isolated areas. The family day care system has been expanded with new centres set up and existing establishments expanded. Family day care is a wonderful choice for those parents who want flexibility to arrange hours of care which best suit their individual needs. The secure, home-like environment is ideal for babies and young children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The children's services program has also identified the need for out of school hours care to meet the growing need for child care among school aged children. Quality outside school care enables parents with school aged children to remain in or re-enter the work force to increase their skills through further education. An innovative new neighbourhood occasional care concept has also been introduced. This will provide parents who look after their children at home with more opportunities to take a break to attend appointments, such as visiting a doctor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own electorate hundreds of working families have benefited from this range of excellent programs. Our government also recognises that the cost of child care is a legitimate expense for women earning an income. That is why the child-care cash rebate is a great initiative. It will help families with the cost of child care associated with employment, training, education or job search. A feature of this support is that it is not income tested and will provide up to $61.20 per week for two or more children. Unlike a tax concession, the cash rebate is claimed as the cost is incurred, rather than up to 18 months later. That is why it is a fundamentally fairer system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Transport. How does the minister reconcile the maintenance of Australia's high air safety record with the fact there were no regulations covering the charter flight of the DC3 routed to Norfolk Island and which ditched in Botany Bay on 24 April 1994? Will he acknowledge that the lack of air safety regulations covering this flight contributed to the crash and that it was only the fortunate proximity of private fishing vessels that rescued the 26 passengers and the skill of the pilot which avoided what could have been the worst air disaster in Australia's history? What action has the minister taken to review the regulations relating to air charter flights to ensure that no such event can happen again?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member has asked this question of someone who has had to live all his life under the flight paths of the Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport and in the shadow of air disaster. My most vivid memories are of attending the scene of a DC3 which crashed into the lakes system at the Lakes Golf Club when I was a small boy. I was one of the first people present at the scene of that accident. As a state member of parliament, immediately after the crash of the King Air aircraft in 1980 I stood and witnessed the most horrific carnage that I have ever experienced. I had never seen disaster on such a scale. I have had this job as Minister for Transport now for four months, and I will tell honourable members this: no-one will put more energy into guaranteeing the high standards of aviation safety in this country than I.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of major air transport, Australia has an enviable safety record&mdash;indeed, it is the envy of the whole of the rest of the world; no-one does better&mdash;and the opposition should acknowledge that. But, whilst our performance with major aircraft safety is better than world best, our performance in charter operations and general aviation is no better than the rest of the world. That is something that should concern all of us, and I know it certainly concerns the honourable member for Hume who spoke in this parliament only yesterday on the issue of the Monarch Air disaster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was appalled to learn that it is alleged&mdash;we have to await the outcome of the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation report before this is through&mdash;that because a plane was 50 years old it could undertake a seven-hour journey across the Tasman Sea which would not have been allowed had that aircraft been built after 1963. If that is the case, then clearly the regulations are defective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the opposition, I will not be prejudging that issue. The fact is that we have had a series of accidents. There was one on the weekend which I think anyone watching television would have been horrified by. The scene reminiscent of the great Waldo Pepper involving a couple of people being incinerated in a light aircraft I know shocked and appalled everyone who saw it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken to the chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority. I put to the House that we in Australia are very fortunate to have had as the leader of the Civil Aviation Authority since last year General Peter Gration. No-one has served Australia better and no-one is more capable of giving leadership in respect of the Civil Aviation Authority and the very important work that it must pursue. I have spoken to General Gration in respect of these incidents and, indeed, in respect of the action that must be taken, and must be taken immediately, after the interim report of BASI into the Monarch Air disaster is available. I expect that report to come to me within the next 24 hours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was in anticipation of that and following upon the 25 passengers landing in the water in Botany Bay that I personally contacted General Gration. I have his assurance that he will do everything in these areas necessary to guarantee the highest standards. I trust him and I trust the task that he undoubtedly will complete.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had the good fortune last week to spend a number of days in Western Australia. Indeed, the honourable member for Perth was able to accompany me at a number of functions I was able to attend. I can say that the views expressed to me by the business community of Perth certainly do not coincide with that being expressed by the Western Australian Premier in terms of the acceptance and support of the Australian Securities Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fair to say that Western Australia joined the national corporations scheme of all the Australian jurisdictions I suppose with most reluctance and with most concern as to how the ASC would operate. I am pleased to be able to say that in the almost three years since the ASC has been an active operation in Western Australia it has built up a great deal of confidence in the local business community. The regional commissioner there, Murray Allen, I think has a good reputation amongst the local business community. That initial point should be made: the ASC is held in high regard among the users of the organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the allegation that not enough has been done to prosecute outstanding offences flowing from the excesses of the 1980s, again the facts do not coincide with what the Premier's allegations are. Since 1 July 1991, in Western Australia alone there have been 13 successful prosecutions in major criminal matters. Some 19 major civil actions are currently before the court. There have been some 41 prosecutions of major criminal matters and three prosecutions of major civil actions. Obviously, this does not include far more numerous more minor matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, some investigations are still under way involving activities in Western Australia. We await with interest the outcome of those investigations. The reality of the situation in the west indicates that the ASC is operating effectively. It is well respected by the business community there. Premier Court's utterances can be dismissed for what they are&mdash;the simple rantings of someone who goes on with state rights rhetoric on any issue. He just pulls out the next page. It does not matter what the heading is; he just goes on with exactly the same line. It is not supported by the users of the organisation in Western Australia.</PARA>

Why has no action been taken, 11 months after the crash of a Monarch Air aircraft in Young last year, to bring to account those Civil Aviation Authority senior managers who defied the obvious and allowed Monarch to continue to fly so that seven people were killed on 11 June last year on a Monarch aircraft that had had the autopilot removed and several instruments rendered inoperative that were vital to the safe operation of the aircraft, particularly when, on two separate occasions, airworthiness inspectors within the Civil Aviation Authority had recommended that Monarch be grounded and, in particular, after the managing director of the airline had admitted to fraudulently altering the registration of an aircraft to make it suitable for regular public transport?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is absolutely untrue to say that there has been no action by the CAA. A great deal of work has been done by the Civil Aviation Authority and the BASI investigators during the months that have elapsed since that accident last year. I know the emotion of the honourable member and I know the relationship that he has with his constituents in that close-knit community. He is not the only person in this House who had personal friendships with people who died on that occasion. My wife lost two friends in the process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Civil Aviation Authority is well advanced in a range of reforms that resulted from the report of the Terrell inquiry into air safety and the CAA's management of air safety which was brought down last year. Of the 58 recommendations of the Terrell inquiry, 38 have now been adopted and put in place. As late as the last 24 hours, I have received an assurance from the Civil Aviation Authority that it is proceeding with absolute haste to guarantee that the remaining 20 recommendations&mdash;bringing it to 58, that is the total number of recommendations&mdash;are implemented by the end of June this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the honourable member to say that there has been a tardiness on the part of the Civil Aviation Authority, I think is incorrect. To suggest, as he has, or to go further than to suggest, to declare the guilt of officers of the Civil Aviation Authority, as he did in the House last night and as he has repeated today, I think is also premature. For my part, I will await the BASI report that I will receive within the next 24 to 48 hours. Immediately I have it, I will make it available to the honourable member for him to study. I think that is entirely appropriate. I will also await the outcome of the coronial inquiry, which will be conducted later on this year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Reid for his question and for giving me the opportunity of informing the House that more than one million Australians working under federal awards are now covered by workplace agreements under the Federal Industrial Relations Act&mdash;one million Australian workers. That represents 2,000 workplace agreements finalised before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, and all of them finalised since October 1991. Indeed, this year the rate has picked up and half of those 2,000 agreements have been registered in the last 12 months.

In New South Wales all they have managed is 579 agreements covering 43,000 workers, that is, 11 per cent of all of the New South Wales workers covered under state awards. This is the much vaunted New South Wales system. We have achieved 45 per cent penetration; they are back at 11 per cent.

Yet we continue to hear from the states how well they are going and how poorly they regard the federal system. The fact is that the federal system under the existing legislation saw us run rings around them all. Of course that was before the amendments that have come into effect in the last month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, 90 per cent of all businesses with 500 or more employees in the federal system now have workplace agreements. But we are interested in picking up the rest. We are particularly interested in looking at the non-union or lightly unionised sector. That was one of the principal purposes of the Industrial Relations Reform Act. Already in its first four weeks of operation we have seen the first agreements put forward. Indeed, we have seen agreements registered without union involvement in terms of the arrangements that prevailed up until this year.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the safety net that we provide through the social security system is the key instrument for poverty avoidance and alleviation in this country. Our system has been reformed and improved over the course of the 1980s and the 1990s. We now have a system which has been carefully studied and found to be highly effective and efficient at its poverty alleviation and avoidance objective, to the point that around 90 per cent in net terms of payments made through the social security system goes to people who would otherwise be in poverty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This sharpening up of the targeting is a very major achievement of this government and is a crucial element in our efforts to keep fiscal policy in reasonable shape.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The evidence is that major improvements have been made over the course of the last decade. For example, very substantial improvements in family payments and rental assistance have meant that payments to an unemployed couple with two dependent children under the age of 13 have doubled in real terms over that period. A sole parent with two dependent children renting privately at the beginning of this government's term of office was nine per cent below the poverty line. That person would now be four per cent above the poverty line. A single pensioner renting privately is now 15 per cent above the poverty line. Pensioners who own their own home are 49 per cent above the poverty line. A pensioner couple who own their own home are 62 per cent above the poverty line. In all these areas, there have been marked and major improvements against the Henderson poverty line, which itself has increased by 16 per cent over that period. So the increase in absolute terms is even more substantial against the increase in the Henderson poverty line.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an enormous achievement. In addition to those payment improvements, the measures we have taken to extend occupational superannuation and to have a more effective child support scheme have meant that many of our clients are receiving substantial sources of income over and above the social security payments that they receive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area we tried to address in the last budget, which is the remaining area of concern, is single people on unemployment payments. At the time we came into office, they were 36 per cent below the poverty line. I regret to say that they are still somewhat below the poverty line, but we have made a huge improvement in that time. In last year's budget, we prioritised them by making a real increase over and above the inflation rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, across the board, I think our achievements in this area are real and substantial. The claims by some that they are not are clearly false.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a feature of Australian political debate at the moment, particularly since opposition members junked their Fightback document with a cheerful air&mdash;a plethora of them threatened to resign if it was not implemented in detail and to the letter, and another plethora of them said that it represented their profoundest convictions about the future needs of Australia&mdash;that all discipline seems to have been lost on the part of the opposition. On the one hand, the opposition spokesman on the Treasury is absolutely demanding massive cuts in public outlays. On the other hand, in just about any conceivable area of government policy one would care to think of, as a problem arises, a suggestion is made that more resources ought to be devoted to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most recent example of that is the opposition spokesman on foreign affairs, the honourable member for Kooyong, who called on the Prime Minister to intervene in the budget process to have Australia's overseas aid budget increased. In the last election he ran on a policy of reducing by $200 million over the next two years the amount devoted to Australia's foreign aid. He is one of those who appear to have been liberated so that one side of the opposition can perambulate about the place talking about the need for budget discipline and another section of the opposition can stand up and perorate on the need for more expenditure in particular areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As it happens, of course, the public generally, and members of this House, will know what the government intends to devote to the area of foreign aid when the budget is announced, but I think it is worth pointing out these facts. Australia has a better record, in terms of the percentage of our GDP assigned to foreign aid, than the United Kingdom, Portugal, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Austria, Spain, New Zealand, the United States and Ireland. It is in pretty good company, looking through the bulk of those nations. There is a very substantial number of respectable countries among them, including some who are noted for a degree of generosity in the area of foreign aid, such as the United States and Japan; and the United Kingdom has not been regarded over time as niggardly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might point out one or two other things about these nations. We have about 38 per cent of our GDP in the public sector. All of those nations which have a better performance in percentage GDP terms in foreign aid than Australia have much higher percentages of their GDP in the public sector. They include the Scandinavian countries. They do come up with very good figures on foreign aid&mdash;such as 0.7, 0.8 and one per cent of GDP&mdash;but, for example, something like 72 per cent of Sweden's GDP is in the public sector. It is obviously in a position where, devoted to government attention each time its budget is considered, there is a very considerable amount more resources available for disbursement for any particular purpose, including foreign aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think there is any country with a public sector the size of ours&mdash;and there are only about two with a public sector smaller than ours, including the United States and Japan&mdash;that does better on foreign aid.

The sorts of figures that you are talking about sound, off the top of my head, roughly of the appropriate dimensions. It has to be said that those propositions in the better cities program are basically aimed at ensuring that we optimise the use of public utilities to ensure that our cities, which have a very substantial tendency to spread expansively, have that process somewhat corrected. It is natural, in those circumstances, that where there are the greatest centres of population there is likely to be a strong tendency in the program to recognise them.

It is a report of the Victorian parliament. I understand that he has an interest in the construction industry and has been following that report. We now have a report which contributes nothing to reform in the construction industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is a sad thing, because the Victorian parliament's own report into the construction industry flies in the face of the Victorian government's cooperation with the Commonwealth government over reform of the construction industry. That is the most disappointing aspect. So under the Commonwealth process&mdash;where we have the Construction Industry Development Agency&mdash;the Victorian government, along with other conservative governments, has seen the light and the need for cooperation in order to improve the construction industry. But not so the conservative elements of the Victorian parliament. That is the most objectionable part of the report that was handed down yesterday and, as I say, brought to my attention by the honourable member for Corio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the so-called important conclusions of the Victorian report is `the Victorian building and construction industry is critically divided on what the basic productivity objectives are and how to achieve such objectives.' That ignores the fact that there are dozens of enterprise agreements in the construction industry which themselves define productivity and which themselves have produced greater productivity in the construction industry. So the report is outdated and does not understand the sorts of processes that are taking place now between construction agents and the building unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also flies in the face of real live facts like the fact that, as a result of reforms in the construction industry, the Great Southern Stand at the MCG&mdash;as I have mentioned here before and which was a $130 million project&mdash;was built four months ahead of schedule. So the Victorian parliament, or at least the conservatives in it, are unaware that their own Great Southern Stand was built four months ahead of schedule.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They appear to be unaware that, in the years between 1989 and 1992&mdash;for which we have figures&mdash;on the aspect of industrial disputes, for instance, an average of 38 days were lost on projects started in 1989 compared with 17.1 days lost for projects commenced in 1992. In a recent survey of 50 projects in the construction industry, 85 per cent of those projects met or bettered their cost targets. So here it is: the conservative elements of the Victorian parliament are at loggerheads with their own Victorian government, which has cooperated in our process in the reform of the construction industry, and have ignored the very practical processes of reform in that industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was asked a question earlier on, and a note from the Minister for Foreign Affairs has been handed to me. He says that the Australian Embassy in Phnom Penh, together with the British Embassy, has been working closely on this issue with the Cambodian government, which has primary responsibility for achieving the release of Miss Wilkinson and her British companions. The trio has been held by the Khmer Rouge since 11 April 1994. He is satisfied that the Cambodian government is fully committed to gaining the group's safe release. The minister is similarly satisfied that every possible effort has been made by Australian officials in Cambodia to assist both local authorities and members of Miss Wilkinson's family. Both my colleague Senator Bolkus and the secretary to the department of the Minister for Foreign Affairs were recently in Cambodia and discussed with Cambodian ministers and officials our concerns for the safety of the group.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek leave to make a ministerial statement relating to the white paper on employment, industry and regional development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This white paper reflects the collective concern of Australians and their collective ambition. Their concern for their fellow Australians, their ambition to make this a good society and a great and successful country. It is a statement about the two imperatives of a decent society&mdash;compassion and strength. About the bonds which exist between all Australians&mdash;and the premium this country places on the talent and energy of every individual. It is about the desire to extend the safety net and basic services which expand equality of opportunity and go to make a truly civilised society&mdash;and the ability to pay for them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a white paper for the times we live in: an era of unprecedented change and equally unprecedented national opportunity. It is also an era in which hundreds of thousands of Australians, through no fault of their own, are bearing the  burden of that change and are denied their share of opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment is without question the greatest problem we face. Unemployment saps the confidence and self-esteem of our fellow Australians&mdash;which in turn saps the nation's. It damages the social fabric. It has profound consequences for our social cohesion. As we have seen in other countries, ignored and neglected as a social problem, left to a fate to be decided solely by `market forces', unemployment threatens to create a permanent underclass. It threatens to create the conditions for social decay. We are not alone among nations in this&mdash;it is endemic to the Western developed countries. This government for one is determined to deal with the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said on election night last year that we will not leave the unemployed behind. And I said on Australia Day this year that this recovery must be shared by all of us. The white paper I present to the House today, entitled Working Nation, delivers on those two commitments. But success will not come easily: with this white paper we cannot say that the battle has been won, but we can say that it has been joined, and we sincerely hope not just by the Commonwealth government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has to be understood that success here depends upon all Australians joining the effort. That means business and trade unions and communities. It means all tiers of government. If we do want to reach the point where we can say that every Australian who wants a job can have one, it will require a conscious and concerted national effort. So we do not say that this white paper will wipe away the problem at a stroke, but we do say that Australia will not leave people neglected and forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through this document, Australia says to those who are out of work: we believe you are entitled to the benefits of recovery and a chance to contribute to it. If you do not have the appropriate skills, we will help you get them. If you are young, we will see that you are trained. If you have been a long time out of work, we will offer you employment and training, if that is what you need. It says we will do all we can to help make you ready for a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The means of giving concrete expression to our intentions constitute the most profound reform of Australia's labour market and social security provisions since World War II. The new provisions are tailored to meet the needs of the unemployed in the modern Australian economy. They will serve Australia for many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper is a statement of policy on employment and growth. It takes the view&mdash;the incontestable view&mdash;that economic growth is the key to employment growth. The evidence is very plainly there in this recovery&mdash;we have already seen 230,000 new jobs created in the past 12 months. That is why a substantial part of the white paper addresses itself to the means by which Australia can achieve higher levels of competitiveness. One of our great goals in these last years of the century must be economic efficiency, and the micro-economic reform and other measures described in this paper are no less important than the training, labour market and social security reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government believes that Australia can sustain or improve upon the present rate of low inflation growth through to the end of the decade. The period will be characterised by a continuation of the trend towards successful small and medium size enterprises producing sophisticated manufactures for export. It will also see continued growth in sophisticated services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian business and industry will need to be increasingly flexible, innovative and responsive to customer needs. It will need these qualities to succeed in the increasingly competitive markets of the world. As these companies grow, jobs will grow with them. But we know from the experience of the 1980s that very largely these new jobs will go to new entrants to the labour market and not to the long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the green paper indicated, even with strong economic growth, without intervention of the kind we have decided to undertake in this white paper, by mid-1998 there would still be some 290,000 people in the pool of long-term unemployed. This is not only profoundly unfair, it is profoundly inefficient. It is a waste of our greatest resource&mdash;the talent and energy of our people. Returning the long-term unemployed to the productive process of the nation not only returns them to the income, social interaction and creativity which work provides, it taps their potential for the good of Australia. As the white paper says, when we employ these otherwise wasted human resources we are made stronger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Large numbers of long-term unemployed people demand large outlays on social security and other assistance. Furthermore, having so many people effectively disqualified from the work force reduces the efficiency of the labour market. In this recovery the complement to skill formation in the labour market is not going to come from migration. This time it has to come from training our own people, including those who are presently unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The details of the government's policy reforms are spelt out in the second volume of the white paper. The measures I am announcing today will cost $1.7 billion in their first full year. Those who may question the cost of these measures should ask themselves what are the costs of doing nothing. The cost of failing to introduce the major efficiency and equity benefits to the labour market, industry and the regions that this package describes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that we have been able to accomplish these fundamental reforms consistent with our target of a deficit of around one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. For the information of honourable members, I will concentrate on only the most substantial of the new measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Central to the government's strategy for getting the long-term unemployed back into work is the job compact. The job compact puts new obligations on both the government and those receiving unemployment benefits. The government will provide to those who have been on unemployment benefits for 18 months or more individual case management, training and support and the offer of a job for six to 12 months. Individuals will be expected to take the job or lose their benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will also introduce measures to identify people at risk of becoming long-term unemployed. Together with those who have been continuously unemployed for 12 months, these people will be given individual case management, including remedial action in such areas as literacy, numeracy, language and vocational training and access to relevant labour market programs. It is expected that over half a million people will receive individual case management each year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a radical program, a qualitative change in the way we approach labour market problems. The objective is to make long-term unemployed people ready for a job, and break forever the pattern in which the long-term unemployed become steadily more dispirited and unqualified for employment, while employers become steadily less inclined to consider them employable. In other words, the purpose of the job compact is principally to see that a substantial proportion of the new jobs in the recovery go to long-term unemployed Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A new training wage will be introduced to provide employers with extra incentives to hire long-term unemployed workers and invest in their training. The training wage encourages employers to provide training places in two ways. The award wage will be discounted for accredited training and the employer will receive a wage subsidy from the government at a level above what it would be if no training were involved. This represents a substantial incentive for employers to play their part in the national effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An in-principle agreement on the training wage has been reached with a high level ACTU committee which will be recommending its adoption to the ACTU executive. The government will also be consulting with employers on the details of the training wage. To deliver case management and job placement services, the government will radically change the labour market by engaging community and private sector agencies. Job seekers will have a choice between these and the CES, with the competition between them regulated and encouraged by a new authority&mdash;the Employment Service Regulatory Agency, ESRA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CES will be revitalised to meet the greater responsibilities placed upon it by the job compact and other initiatives. Additional resources, extra training of staff, external recruitment and improved information technology will be brought to the operations of the service. The emphasis will be on closer relations with employers, greater skills and efficient delivery through more sophisticated technology and coordination. For instance, job boards and job cards in CES offices will be replaced with computerised vacancy systems featuring user-friendly technology to encourage self-help job searches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the white paper says, we are never going to return to a world where large numbers of full-time jobs are available  for unskilled young workers. As the keys to a successful modern economy are skills, ideas and innovation, the keys to employment are education and training. It cannot be stressed too much&mdash;in the modern economy skills are our greatest competitive advantage. Whether it is in global enterprises or local small businesses, it is on the ability of our people to add value that our standard of living depends. It is on skills that every individual's standard of living increasingly depends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past decade, the number of young people completing year 12 or an initial post-school qualification has dramatically increased. However we are still below the average for the OECD and well short of the goal that all Australian governments have set&mdash;namely, 95 per cent of 19-year-olds by 2001. The white paper describes the government's program for building the skills of young Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The three principal elements of new government policy are: first, the government aims to encourage young people to stay in education and training by giving them appropriate financial support and more relevant courses run jointly by schools and industry. Second, we will be increasing the number and range of entry level training places for young people&mdash;by an estimated 50,000 by 1995-96. And thirdly, we will be introducing as a major policy change a youth training initiative for unemployed young people. The key to success is to provide help at an early stage in  the unemployment cycle, which means with the least possible delay after leaving school. The principal features of the youth training initiative are:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">intensive case management, with an initial assessment of skills and knowledge, for all unemployed people under the age of eighteen</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">a doubling of the number of labour market and vocational training places for young people</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">assistance in finding a job, and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">reformed income support arrangements to help keep young people in education or training. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the youth training initiative&mdash;in the clearest possible signal that every young Australian should be in education, training or employment&mdash;unemployment benefits&mdash;or the jobsearch allowance will be replaced by a youth training allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Investing in skills of Australians, particularly young Australians, is the best investment we can make. This is recognised well beyond the realms of government. Industry is increasingly recognising it and increasingly indicating its desire to play a part. We are very well aware of industry's concerns about the relevance of current training and for this reason we are anxious to engage industry in both the design and delivery of courses. In future, Australian vocational training will be available through traineeships based in schools, TAFE, industry and labour market programs and will be available to adults as well. A training wage which offers a much simpler alternative to the multiple industry-specific rates currently applying will be available to employers who provide entry-level training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The social safety net was a term first used in the 1940s by Ben Chifley. He thought of it as the net under a trapeze artist, `to break the fall towards destitution and sustain a man and his family while they help him climb the ladder of opportunity again'. The basic principle of the safety net remains the same&mdash;and so does the basic necessity in a decent society to maintain it. But circumstances have changed and so must the way we design the net. The most fundamental difference is that no longer do families depend on the man alone to bring in the income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general, the present social security system continues to assume that only one member of a couple, in most cases the husband, will be actively looking for work while the other will be a dependant. This ignores the increase in employment for women. It means that unemployed couples have not been encouraged to take advantage of the opportunities in the labour market. Over the last 10 years, the gap between income support for a married couple and income from lower paid jobs has also narrowed and the incentive to find work has been greatly diminished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In another basic structural reform of our income support system, young unemployed couples without children will need to qualify for unemployment payments in their own right and the joint income test for unemployed couples will be abolished. The effect of this will be to encourage both partners to seek work. It also means that many low income working families will gain extra income support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the current social security income test, after a modest level of income, for every dollar of income earned, a dollar of income support is lost. From July next year the dollar-for-dollar taper will be replaced with a 70c in the dollar taper which will mean that people will always be better off from working because work will always increase their total income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In another radical initiative, a parenting allowance will be introduced to provide an independent source of income for parents in low income families who care for dependent children under 16 years of age. The parenting allowance will effectively provide a payment for one parent free of any obligation to seek work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will also be a more generous income test for those who wish to combine parenting with paid work. By any measure, this is a major reform. The simplest measure is this&mdash;it will mean an extra $59 per week on average for nearly 120,000 low income families. The parenting allowance signals a new approach to income support based on the right of people to be paid as individuals, rather than as dependent partners. In this, and in the fact that it constitutes greater recognition of women's role in the work force and the growth in part-time and casual employment, the parenting allowance is consistent with the changes to income testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we do not take remedial action, the long-term unemployed and many young Australians at risk of joining their ranks will be relegated to the margins of our national life and miss out on the opportunities offered by the present recovery. The same can be said of many of the regions of Australia. The white paper presents a new Commonwealth approach to regional development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to make the most of all our national resources, including the skills and energy of our people, we need to ensure that the regions of Australia are given the opportunity to flourish&mdash;that they become partners in Australia's growth. As the white paper says, to neglect the regions is to neglect not only a great many Australians and all that they have to give this country, but to pass up the opportunity to build a stronger and more diverse economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three reports on regional development have been received by the government in recent times&mdash;the Kelty task force report, the McKinsey report and the report of the Industry Commission. The principal lessons to be learned are that the regions, though presently enjoying very different degrees of success, have in common an abundance of energy and commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government takes the view, with Kelty and McKinsey, that the most effective approach for the Commonwealth is to provide strategic assistance of a kind that will help the regions to make the most of their human and physical resources. More often than not, this will require them to integrate their local economies with the national and international economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper instances some remarkable achievements and some other places where major obstacles have yet to be overcome. The uneven performance of our regions in large part flows from an uneven quality of organisation and leadership. The white paper details the way in which the Commonwealth government will support the formation and functioning of regional groupings and provide assistance to regions so that they can develop and implement effective strategic plans, with an emphasis on international best practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will also be significantly modifying the tax treatment of infrastructure bonds and taking other steps to encourage private sector investment in regional Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper nominates two regional development projects the government will support which may be taken as models for other regions in Australia. The Goulburn Valley and the Sunraysia have developed plans for ecologically sustainable, highly productive, self-funding, irrigated agriculture which will repair the environment and greatly increase the contribution to GDP. The Sunraysia is expected to double output in the next two decades. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as it is essential that we do not allow the long-term unemployed to become cut off from the mainstream of society, it is equally important that we take steps to see that regions of Australia are not left to drift out of the nation's economic and social life. These reforms and initiatives necessarily depend on continuing economic growth. They depend on the ability of Australian enterprise to flourish and carve out a future in the world economy and especially the Asia-Pacific. For that reason the white paper contains a statement of the government's industry policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the thrust of government policy is towards globalisation, competitiveness and productivity. We are seeing major success from measures already taken: a dramatic increase in exports, the rise of dynamic small and medium sized businesses which have been born of the export culture developed in the last decade&mdash;`born global' in other words&mdash;the growth of manufactured exports to rank now with agriculture and mining as a proportion of GDP and the rapid growth in exports of sophisticated manufactures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no question that our policies, including our tariff policy, are enabling Australia to be a competitive player in the regional and world economy. There is equally no question that we have no choice but to continue the process of reform which alone will keep us in the race. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper contains a broad statement of the principles governing our industry policy and a number of specific measures consistent with those principles. The process of micro-economic reform will continue. A consistent goal of the next few years must be economic efficiency. The principles of best practice, which many Australian companies have adopted, must be adopted by the nation itself. In this, as in all the measures described in this white paper, much depends on other tiers of government, on trade unions, business, communities, the people of Australia themselves. It demands a continuation of the great cultural shift which has occurred in the past decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government sees its proper role as creating a competitive environment for industry and, by strategic intervention, helping to create competitive companies. As the paper says, our policy must be to harness the power of markets, while recognising that, left to themselves, markets will not always give us the best possible results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are measures described in this white paper to remove impediments to business efficiency, to facilitate exports, to encourage research and development, to make access to finance for small and medium sized business easier, to remove regulation and lower business costs and, among the latter, the white paper announces the suspension of the training guarantee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One significant initiative will be the establishment of a body to improve coordination and delivery of government programs for business. The body, to be called Ausindustry, will be within the portfolio of the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology and will be guided by a board comprising people with experience in all aspects of business, from research and development to international trade. The establishment of Ausindustry is a direct response to two recent studies by McKinsey which found that business was often confused about the range of services available under government programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our success will also depend on the capacity and willingness of Australians to strike productivity bargains in the nation's workplaces. The Industrial Relations Reform Act introduced last year provides the framework for this process to rapidly proceed. Much now depends on the willingness of employers and employees to strike the kinds of bargains which will be mutually rewarding to them, and rewarding also to Australia's economic future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen in a very short time a sea change, not just in the shape of the Australian economy, not just in its orientation and in the way we do business, but in the way we think about our business practice. We understand both the need for, and the principles of, competitiveness. We understand the need for cooperation in the workplace. We understand the need for skills and creativity. We know that we must be a nation which makes things and sells things in the international markets of the world. We know these things principally because we know that not to do them will mean to fail as a nation. It will mean a lower standard of living for this and for future generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major reforms announced in this white paper should be seen in this context. We do not accept that we can raise the standard of living of Australians by allowing a large number of people to drift permanently out of the system. We do not accept that we can afford to waste their potential. Nor do we accept that the only way to maintain our standard of living is to lower the wages of Australian workers. The white paper is underpinned by the belief that Australia must and can be a high wage and a high productivity country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A hundred years ago, the Australian colonies federated into a nation which numbered among its watchwords `the social laboratory of the world'. The Australia of a hundred years ago prided itself on advanced social policy. Just 50 years ago, with the white paper on full employment, another Australian Labor government codified and consolidated social policies which together formed the basis of the Australian social welfare system. That was a document of its times&mdash;in some essential ways, a much more modest document than this one. This white paper is a document for these times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These social programs, together with those introduced in recent years, mean that in this decade we should take pride in the fact that, faithful to previous generations of Australians, we have made this one of the most sophisticated social democracies in the world. It would be no bad thing if, in this decade, we also developed pride in the great changes we have made to our economy. We should be proud that we now compete in areas we once thought beyond our capacity. It would be a very good thing if, at the end of the century, we defined ourselves as one of the very fair societies in the world and one of the most creative.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that they have been horrified by the exposes undertaken by the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) into the crash of the Monarch aircraft. I am sure that they have been horrified by the crash of the Dove aeroplane a few months ago at Essendon. I am sure that they were horrified to hear the answers that were given by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) in this House today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that over the last five or six years the administration of aviation in Australia has become an absolute disaster zone. To give the House an indication of just how bad things are becoming, not only in the operations but in the administration, I will quote from the minister himself. He was asked a question in the Senate a few weeks ago and gave this answer on 14 March. The question concerned how many accidents and incidents had been reported in Australia in the three-year period to the end of November 1993. The minister answered that 10,000 accidents and incidents were reported in Australia for the three-year period to the end of November 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> While it is true that some of them would not be regarded as major issues, the facts of the matter are that the second and third tiers of aircraft operation in Australia are areas of very great concern. In the 12 months from November 1990 to November 1991, 24 accidents were classified in category 2&mdash;namely, regional airline operations&mdash;and 22 incidents. From November 1991 to November 1992, there were 20 accidents and 10 incidents. From November 1992 to November 1993, there were seven accidents and one incident. Thank goodness that there have been no category 1 disasters and that our major carriers at least have a very safe level of operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The plain facts are that Australia's skies are not as safe as they once were or how people think they may be. Much of this has come about because of the government's failure to control the development of safe aviation in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I remind the House of some things that have happened in recent years. There was an absolute debacle concerning the radar contracts. We remember the tremendous efforts of Senator MacGibbon in the other place and the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) here in making sure that that was all exposed. Hundreds of thousands of dollars were wasted by the Civil Aviation Authority because it had to go back and redo the whole radar contract system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Remember the debacle, which is still going on, over the new provisions for airspace management around Australia. We were supposed to go into this new system last November, but there were such objections, concerns and fears raised in the aviation industry that the implementation date has been put back. Perhaps we will see it happening a little later this year. There was utter confusion within the aviation industry as to what many of those changes were all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I suppose that nothing better exemplifies this than the report that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on Friday, 29 April 1994. The headline read `Row erupts over air safety'. Two different departments&mdash;the Civil Aviation Authority and the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation&mdash;had a go at each other because they disagreed with the violations of controlled airspace over a five-year period. BASI brought to everyone's attention the real dangers that were starting to exist in air space management. As usual, the CAA said, `Everything will probably be all right.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We have been through another situation. The department has insisted&mdash;probably rightly so&mdash;that beacons be installed in all operating aircraft. A row then developed as to what sort of beacon it should be. They should have been in place by now, but, once again, because of the dithering of this government, that project has been delayed. We will not see the introduction of those beacons until the middle of this year. It does not matter where you look in all the rows about safety, people are concerned at the obvious decline in safety standards in Australian aviation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> On 28 April, a report from Australian Associated Press indicated that a Worksafe report had found that proposed changes to work hours for pilots might compromise pilot and passenger safety. The Australian International Pilots Association, one of the most responsible unions in the aviation industry, released a summary of the report which it will use to argue against a Civil Aviation Authority proposal to increase the maximum duty period for flight crews from 16 to 22 hours per day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The association is concerned that there is no other country that has those particular provisions. For some reason the Civil Aviation Authority has decided that they should be examined as a real proposition. The government is yet to make a determination on what is going to happen there. I think one of the great tragedies is that, while we can still proudly boast one of the safest aviation systems in the world, the plain fact is that it has been more and more challenged. It is being challenged because we have seen a decline in the capacity of governments and departments to administer safety standards in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In question time today I was interested to hear the minister say that, as a result of the issues that were raised yesterday by the honourable member for Hume and me, he actually rang the chairman of the CAA this morning. He has only been the minister for four months; we cannot expect him to get onto these things too soon&mdash;especially when it comes to aviation safety. What an absolute disaster!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great criticisms of this minister that I get from all sections of the aviation industry is that they can never get in to see him. The General Aviation Association and the airports people are all saying that it is physically impossible to make an appointment to discuss these matters of great moment with this particular minister. In the meantime we have a Civil Aviation Authority that has been charged with raising so much revenue that it would almost seem that that is its prime responsibility rather than determining the safety standards and regulations of Australia. We do have some very dedicated and very good people in those departments, but they are frustrated now to the point where the morale in the Civil Aviation Authority is at an absolute low. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am surprised that, when the minister rang this morning and suggested that something should be done, he did not say, `Why hasn't something been done over the past several years by the CAA board to bring this whole administration into shape?' Obviously, at the end of the day, even with independent statutory bodies of the government, the minister has the ultimate responsibility to make sure that it has that capacity and, in fact, delivers on producing the best aviation safety standards so that all Australians have the capacity to fly around Australia knowing that they will arrive at their destinations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the administration of civil aviation in Australia and all its facets over the last several years, we see that it is a disaster. Let us look at the operations of the Federal Airports Corporation. I was fascinated in the white paper from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to see that we got a one line mention. The one line mention is the allocation of $73 million for some work to be done on the Badgerys Creek airport west of Sydney in the financial years 1995-96 and 1996-97. It is hoped that it might all be finished by then. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, additional money, but two hours before that we had the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) and the chief government whip in this House giving long tirades on the necessity for the development of Badgerys Creek airport. Of course, they were absolutely right. But does the minister honestly believe that the present allocations plus these additional allocations that have come in on this white paper have the capacity to present a full international facility for the people of western Sydney? The answer is obviously no. If I were the honourable member for Werriwa, after my commitment to making sure we were going to get the development of Badgerys Creek airport, I probably would have to go outside this place and either resign my seat or slash my wrists as a result of those statements in the government white paper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Badgerys Creek is essential for the proper development of airport infrastructure in Australia. We need only look around Australia to see this. We had a question today about the state of Adelaide airport. We know the confinement that the length of that runway is having on the international operations there and the requirement for its extension for the development of proper freight facilities in that part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know the absolute disaster of the construction of the new terminal at the Brisbane international airport. It was promised for years and years. Finally it decided to build it. Already, according to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> reports, industry representatives are saying that it is too small and that already it is going to have to start looking towards some more extensions on that edifice that is being built. Brisbane international airport is going to be the second busiest airport in Australia by 1998. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To go a little bit further, we can go around the regional areas of Australia and see the difficulties that are being experienced in many of the remote areas of Australia in terms of being able to maintain airstrips as a result of the government's decision under the airport local ownership plan to willy-nilly hand over the airports to those operations and expect them to operate them profitably. With the regional disasters that we have around Australia, and the recession, and the droughts, it is virtually impossible for people to provide that infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a little bit like a Demtel television commercial: `If you want more, we've got more.' Let us look at the International Air Services Commission. There is some magnificent stuff going on there. At the moment we have a fight going on between Qantas and Ansett. The government, in its wisdom, decided to introduce a second carrier on international rights. Quite properly, the IASC awarded Ansett a number of international services. It is picking up the Osaka service and the Hong Kong service, and it is operating the Bali service. But it has rights to Malaysia&mdash;a huge source of tourism to Australia&mdash;that it is not going to pick up, and it is not going to pick up its rights over the New Zealand route. Qantas has rights that it has not used. On many of these services we have been asked to provide more capacity because the full development of Australian tourism is being wound down because of the lack of availability of seats on those routes at certain times of the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the great initiative that the government had about the common aviation market between Australia and New Zealand. That was supposed to all be in place at the end of last year. We have got no further on that. We have put question after question on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. We never get a response from the minister. Who knows what is going to happen there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation where an air carrier has been given rights to China, but it does not look as though it has the capacity to raise the money to buy an aircraft to operate the services. In the meantime, Qantas is terribly concerned about that, and we have the Chinese wondering what the devil is happening. The potential in and out of China is absolutely enormous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Late last year we had bilateral brawls between Australia and the United States in terms of the North West Airlines services over Osaka and the absolute debacle that happened there. In the end Australia won absolutely nothing, North West Airlines walked away, and we looked like absolute fools. I guess we will have another fight pretty soon, when United Airlines decides that it is going to try to claim those rights. What will the government do then? Back down as usual&mdash;no problems at all.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have just had a situation where Qantas applied for extra capacity over Thailand. What happened? The Thais said, `The deal is not good enough for us. You cannot come in.' Qantas has said, very reluctantly, that now it is going to switch its services to Singapore because the government has not had the capacity to negotiate those air rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have problems; it does not matter whether we look into the administration of the safety aspects of Australian aviation or at the independent statutory corporations such as the Federal Airports Corporation. After all, the FAC is supposed to be a commercial entity. It could pay $1 1/2 million for a share in a fresh food service at Sydney and Brisbane airports, and in the first year of operation it managed to lose about $277,000. One has to question some of its commercial capacity. It does not matter whether we look into that whole area of air rights; we have problems there as well. The plain fact is that the decade of the 1990s has ended up an absolute disaster in terms of the administration of Australian aviation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My good advice to the minister, seeing as he has only been in the chair for four months, is to start to kick a few heads; look at the composition of the board of the CAA and see what he can do to improve it; look at the composition of the Federal Airports Corporation; and look at the composition of his department. Australia's public will not accept second-rate standards in any of these areas. He owes it to the Australian population to provide a safe, secure and viable aviation industry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member gave us a diatribe starting with air safety, which is, of course, the matter of the moment, but then he ranged off in one direction or another to deal with the Federal Airports Corporation, its alleged shortcomings, the question of airport expansion the length and breadth of Australia&mdash;from Adelaide to God only knows where&mdash;and the development of Badgerys Creek. He commented upon debates earlier in the House today, he dealt with the International Air Services Commission and the question of Ansett flights to Bali and non-flights to Malaysia, and the fact that it is not taking up all the rights awarded to it. He mentioned the common aviation market as well as air rights to China itself, not to mention the North West Airlines flights via Osaka. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the real question before the House is none of these things; it is the question of what do we need to do additional to what is already being done to guarantee the highest standards of air safety in this country, to guarantee that we can continue to proudly boast, in the words of the honourable member, `the safest system in the world.' I am reasonably well qualified to speak in this debate because for 24 1/2 years I have represented, at both the state and federal level, constituents who live directly under the flight paths to the biggest and busiest airport in this nation. We have lived with aircraft every minute of every day, except when the curfew was in place, and even then we have lived with those curfew flights, whether propeller-driven or jet, that have been allowed into Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated in the House today, as someone who has personally witnessed crashes and seen the carnage involved, who, as a boy, marvelled at the ability of a DC3 to float for some time before it sank into the Lakes golf course pond in the mid-1950s and who later witnessed what I said was the worst carnage and the most horrific accident that I ever thought could occur, being the crash of the Advance Airlines King Air in 1980, I feel a particular responsibility to pursue with all my vigour the question of air safety and to ensure that we do everything in our power in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Fadden misrepresented me today when he suggested that I have only just&mdash;in the last 24 hours&mdash;contacted General Gration and the CAA in regard to air traffic safety. The honourable member should be aware that I have been in regular contact with the CAA from the moment I took up my duties as Minister for Transport. I have met with representatives of the CAA several times, I have spoken with them on the phone on numerous occasions and, as I confirmed to the House, I spoke again with General Gration this morning to make sure that he and I are on exactly the one wavelength in terms of pursuing these issues of great concern. I am pleased to report to the House today that we are. He indicated to me that he agreed with me completely that we should put all our energy into doing everything possible to see a complete response to the matters of concern regarding air safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I indicated to the House earlier today that, of the 58 identified recommendations of the Terrell report into air safety last year, 38 have already been put into place by the Civil Aviation Authority. General Gration was able to guarantee that the remaining 20 recommendations&mdash;bringing it up to the full quota of 58&mdash;will be in place by the end of June this year. I was pleased to obtain that assurance. We were able to talk further and to discuss this very question raised in the last few weeks about the circumstances in which a DC3 aircraft was allowed to take off&mdash;it did not get very far&mdash;and fly for seven hours across the Tasman Sea carrying no fewer than 25 people, the majority being the children who comprise the Scots College school band. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is true, as has been suggested in press reports, that had that aircraft been built after 1963 it would not have been allowed to undertake that flight, I think there is something seriously wrong with the regulations. I have asked General Gration to make sure that that is addressed as a matter of absolute urgency. Let us not wait for any BASI inquiries into that crash; let us get on and tackle it now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the matters that have been of great concern to the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp), there is one big issue that I think requires attention over and above what we know of the circumstances of the accident to date&mdash;that is, the question of companies which might be in some financial difficulties, and whether there should not be a system of credit watch adopted by the Civil Aviation Authority where it is on a sort of red alert, as it were, to pay particular attention to companies that are fairly close to that viability line. I am not sure how we would go about that, but it is one of the things that I have asked General Gration to pay particular attention to, and I am hopeful that we can devise a system that will allow a lot more attention to be paid to airlines that fly in the future whose financial circumstances are similar to those sad days leading to the awful disaster of Monarch's aeroplane in June last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am able to assure the House that we are concerned about this issue and we are intent on doing everything within our power to pursue a series of regulations and recommendations that will leave Australia absolutely confident in the quality of our air safety. But I will not go out and pre-judge these issues. I know that, in the emotion of the moment when a member is representing an electorate where people have been touched by a great tragedy; where a community has been enormously affected by an accident such as the King Air, there is a tendency to race out and say, `This one is to blame and that one is to blame.' I will not be in on that. What I will do is pursue recommendations as they come from the appropriate authorities to make sure it cannot happen again and to make sure that, if those recommendations suggest that actions of a criminal or disciplinary nature should be taken against particular officers, that is pursued and pursued with all vigour. But I will not come out and act as judge, jury and executioner in this process. That will be for the proper authorities. But I will be&mdash;and this government will be&mdash;the facilitator of making sure that attention is paid by those authorities to all these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the opposition has been at sixes and sevens about the question of the powers of the Civil Aviation Authority. There is no better way of illustrating that than to look at the various quotations of the honourable member for Fadden or, alternatively, the honourable member for Hume or, going to the other place, none other than our friend Senator MacGibbon. If honourable members read the things they have said&mdash;and I have had a chance to do so&mdash;they will see that they take a very different attitude as to how the Civil Aviation Authority should pursue its role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no ambiguity about the position of the honourable member for Hume. He is on the record as saying that the Civil Aviation Authority's role is to be the policeman for all air services in Australia. He is quite clear in his mind as to how the Civil Aviation Authority should function and how it should pursue its duties. On the other hand, the honourable member for Fadden has been a</PARA>
<PARA>touch more circumspect, or he certainly was on 27 October when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no problems with deregulation of the airline industry at all. In fact, deregulation does not mean, and it should not mean, the lowering of safety standards. I hope we can find that this&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he was talking about an accident&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">was an isolated incident rather than one of laxity by the department in allowing some of those standards to slip. I am sure that the latter was not the case.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member believed that the standards could not slip. On the basis of these comments, he has a great deal of confidence in the Civil Aviation Authority. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, I would hope that we would not be going into a frenzy regarding the reintroduction of a fully regulated airline industry when there are obviously so many savings that can be made in a deregulated environment. Perhaps I should not say any more than that until such time as the full report from the Civil Aviation Authority is released regarding this particular accident in Young.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the Monarch airline accident. I agree with the honourable member that we should wait until we have that report. I have indicated that it will be available very shortly. I will then share it with the honourable member for Hume and we will pursue its recommendations. But the opposition's position does not run from that point to the other. It goes a long way further in the utterances of Senator MacGibbon, who is on the record as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We certainly need a cooperative approach from the Civil Aviation Authority . . . We have to get a civil aviation authority that wants to work with, not against, the aviation industry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once upon a time the department of civil aviation worked in cooperation with the industry. It led by example, it counselled people and it advised them.</PARA>
<PARA>So there are a diversity of views in the opposition. Some believe that the CAA should be the policeman. Others believe that we should wait and see. Others believe that the CAA should take a hands-off approach with a full commitment to self-regulation. We have to get the balance right. We have to make sure that there are appropriate rules and regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I see an old aircraft carrying a lot of kids crash into Botany Bay, I am enormously thankful that not a life was lost. But I ask myself: what steps should we be taking to make sure that this cannot happen again? When I see tragically a couple of people burnt to death as a result of a wing-walking stunt exercise on the weekend, which I know horrified every television viewer who unfortunately saw it, I say, `Why are we still doing this? Didn't this cease with Robert Redford and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Great Waldo Pepper</EMPHASIS> all those years ago?' That is one area, along with the question of old aeroplanes operating over the ocean for long distances, which I have asked General Gration to address as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat to the House that I have the greatest of confidence in General Gration. I consider him to be one of the finest Australians that this nation has ever produced. I think we are enormously fortunate to have such an outstanding Australian available in the leadership role of the Civil Aviation Authority. He has told me that 38 of the 58 recommendations of Terrell have been implemented, and I know that is the case. He has told me that he is pursuing the remainder. He has told me that these other issues, such as wing-walking and old aircraft, will be pursued by him with all his vigour and that he will do everything possible to tighten up the internal affairs of the Civil Aviation Authority as a result of the Monarch accident and the lessons learnt from the Monarch accident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may take some months before we have the final recommendations of BASI. We will certainly have an interim report either today, tomorrow or before the end of this week. I hope it contains some things which we can proceed to implement immediately. But we will not be able to attribute blame until such time as we have final recommendations and the results of the coronial inquiry. I implore the honourable member for Hume, in spite of the high emotion he feels on behalf of his constituents who have been so dramatically and tragically affected, to wait and see before we act as judge and jury against the officers of the Civil Aviation Authority, the pilots, the owners of Monarch Air or any other party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the recommendations are available and the determination of the coronial inquiry is before me, he and the House may rest assured that we will do everything possible&mdash;indeed, everything necessary&mdash;to guarantee that we can proudly say that we still boast the highest record of safety anywhere in the world.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was interested to hear the remarks of the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) both in this matter of public importance and in question time earlier today. His response was interesting. For example, he mentioned the viability or credit watch of the airlines around Australia that provide a service to the travelling public. I think this is a critical issue. Had it been in place in Australia, as it is in the UK or the US, Monarch simply would not have been operating much beyond 1991, for the simple reason that Monarch was technically bankrupt at the time. The importance of this, which is learnt from investigating incidents such as the Monarch crash, is that, if an airline is not operating profitably, the first thing it does is cut corners. The corners that it cuts involve things such as maintenance and flying operation procedures. In my view, that ultimately helped contribute to the tragic loss of those seven lives at Young on 11 June last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also interested to hear that the minister will pursue this matter as far as he possibly can. I was very pleased to hear that. But I will give the minister a little bit of an idea of the tiger that he will have to wrestle with. Over the years the CAA has run quite out of control. I have many examples of this, and I will talk about a couple of them today. The Monarch accident is one. This airline was technically bankrupt. The aircraft were not being properly maintained. Indeed, the aircraft that crashed had had the autopilot removed and several vital instruments had been made inoperable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can highlight other instances. I draw to the attention of the House the incident involving Western Airlines that operated out of Wagga. That airline was a standing joke, particularly in Canberra. The joke was that, when a Western Airlines aircraft pulled up, drip trays had to be put under the aircraft to stop the oil spilling all over the apron. In Wagga the airworthiness inspector proposed to his senior managers in the CAA that that airline have its AOC, air operator's certificate, withdrawn and that the aircraft be grounded. Do honourable members know what ended up happening? The senior managers did investigate the claims made by the airworthiness inspector. They were all found to be correct. But, instead of punishing Western Airlines, they punished the airworthiness inspector. He was sidelined. His career is now doomed. But Western Airlines continues to fly. That is the sort of attitude that prevails within the Civil Aviation Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give another example. Seaview Lord Howe Island Pty Ltd operates a Navaho that flies between Norfolk Island and Lord Howe Island. The Navaho can take nine passengers but, because of the length of the strip at Lord Howe Island and the 480-odd nautical miles that has to be flown between the two places, this Navaho is licensed to carry only six passengers because it has to carry a full load of fuel, taking off on a short runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chief pilot of Seaview Aviation reported to the Civil Aviation Authority that he was being forced by his employer to carry nine passengers, against the licensed regulations imposed on that aircraft operating that service. The end result was that the chief pilot was sacked by the airline. The airworthiness inspector recommended that the aircraft and the airline be grounded. What happened? The airline continued to fly. The guy who blew the whistle was punished by being sacked and the airline that was breaking the law continued to fly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was not the only thing it was doing. The airline was operating a scheduled service and yet it was not licensed to provide regular public transport. It was breaking the law because it was carrying more people than it was licensed to carry. It was breaking the law because it was providing an RPT service when it was not licensed to do so. It was also breaking the law because life vests and life rafts were not carried when aircraft were flying over water. Yet this airline which was operating so dangerously and which was putting people's lives at risk continued to fly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have many other examples. I have a list as long as your arm that I could have given yesterday in my speech, but I am afraid that time did not permit me to do so. There are other examples of things going on in the Civil Aviation Authority that should concern the minister. Yesterday I mentioned the possibility of corruption. I cited the instance of flying operations inspectors, who are pilots, who are able to finesse a problem that air operators have on the basis and the understanding that, if they do it, there is plenty of free flying time for them in that airline company's aircraft. This has been suggested. I cited a particular example of it yesterday. But there are more problems than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another activity that occurs with flying operations inspectors and it is called line flying: the CAA's flying operations inspectors fly with airlines. This is designed to give those pilots who work for the CAA flying experience to keep their licences up to scratch, and it also saves the CAA money. But many of those flying operations inspectors are abusing that system. One inspector in particular dons the uniform of one particular airline and flies every fortnight. As a result of this the people who are supposed to be administering, regulating or policing the law&mdash;whichever way we want to describe it&mdash;are working with and alongside the people that they are supposed to be regulating, resulting in a club-like matey arrangement. That is part of the problem because it is the flying operations inspectors who are overriding the recommendations of the airworthiness inspectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give another example. A CAA district officer recommended to the Director of Public Prosecutions that a particular airline operator be charged. The Director of Public Prosecutions looked into the matter and found that a prima facie case existed, so charges were laid. A flying operations officer based here in Canberra, who was at the time acting in what is described as a very senior position, intervened in this matter, spoke to the officer in charge of that district office where the original complaints had come from and demanded that those complaints be withdrawn. However, the DPP had taken those complaints to the point where they could not be withdrawn. But had that flying operations officer been successful, that case would never have gone forward. As it was the case did go forward and the air operator was found guilty of the charge. That would never have happened if that flying operations officer based here in Canberra had had his way. There is something awfully wrong with the way the Civil Aviation Authority is operating. If the minister is going to do what he says he is going to do, he has a big task ahead of him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another critical aspect to all of this which the Monarch Air crash and another crash that took place in Victoria down near Seymour two years ago highlight&mdash;that is, the matter of insurance. People are staggered when they realise that insurance for these types of airlines is not compulsory; it is an optional extra. That is absolutely wrong. I guarantee that all passengers who get in commercial airline aircraft in Australia would believe they are properly insured, but it is not the case. Many of the third level airlines do insure even though it is not required. But even if they do, as was the case in Victoria and has now proven to be the case with Monarch Air, the insurance company claims immediately there was a breach of the Air Navigation Act therefore the policy is voided, therefore there is no liability, and therefore there is no insurance for the victims' families. That is usually what happens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But if the insurance companies do not do that and they do pay out, there is a maximum payout of up to $180,000. If the Minister for Transport were driving his car, had a crash and was made a quadriplegic, he would expect to get $3 million or $4 million in compensation. But if the minister were flying in one of these aircraft, it crashed and he was made a quadriplegic, he could expect to get only up to $180,000&mdash;that is, if the insurance company ever paid up. That is downright unfair. It is inequitable and it has to be addressed. What the minister also has to do in the months ahead of him, as he fulfils the promise that he has given this House today, is to fix the problems of the Civil Aviation Authority and the aviation industry here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope he does live up to what he says. It is terribly important that he does because the lives of many Australians swing on his ability to turn the rhetoric that he has expressed here in this House today into action. If he does not then there will be many more Australians go to their graves as those 25 boys from Scots College nearly did the other day and as some of my constituents did on 11 June last year at Young in an accident that really should never have happened. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a debate like this and with a topic as significant as aviation administration there ought to be a both reasoned and considered form of debate that takes place between us. The Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) was what I would call very measured in his discussion of this topic, and I think that the contributions made by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) and the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) were in the same vein. I am not sure that it is the kind of topic that ought to be brought on in an MPI, but here it is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The starting point in this debate has to be the issue of general air safety in Australia. At the top level is the question of world envy of the fact that Australia has such an excellent air safety record, particularly with regard to the major commercial airlines and the major passenger traffic. There are lots of reasons for that, not the least being the very heavy and intense effort put in over many years by the Civil Aviation Authority and its predecessors requiring those standards, and the requirements instituted under the old two-airline agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the opening up of aviation to competition, and in this current climate of user pays and more and more intense pressure on the dollar in all industries, there are many more planes flying than was the case in the past. They are flying on much tighter margins and governments are under pressure from the industry, from taxpayers, from everyone, to minimise the bureaucratic costs involved with regulation and supervision. At the same time operators are under cost pressures that can lead to short cuts. Those short cuts can often be in the field of safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing in the performance of the airlines or the statistics to date that gives us any reason to believe that this situation is any worse than it has been in the past. But that is not to say that we should not be seriously cognisant of it. I have to say to the honourable members for Hume and Fadden that in the kinds of policies they were coming forward with at the last election there was one little policy complication they got themselves into and have not yet, at this point anyway, jettisoned. In their Fightback proposals they were proposing that this industry bear the full cost of air safety charges: in other words, total user pays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government maintains a regime whereby we finance the operations of the CAA in the field, and there is a subsidy involved because we believe in our commitment. Had that policy come into effect not only would the opposition have been adding a GST to the airline prices but it would also have been removing some of the assistance that is given in a financial way to the supervision of safety; in other words, there would have been a further direct squeeze on this issue of air safety. It is a little puzzling that too much is made of this issue in that context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard the honourable member for Hume on radio this morning. People often ask me, `What's he like?' and all that sort of stuff and I say, `I've known him for a few years. We came into this place together. He's very articulate and he delivers his views, but he is prone to stretch the point a bit and in fact is not always absolutely accurate.' That is a nice way to put it. On the radio this morning in respect of the Monarch incident&mdash;and I fully understand his close interest in and concern about this matter&mdash;I heard him say, `Here it is. It happened all this time ago and nothing has happened.' I do not believe that he really thought that nothing had been done. I hope that he is reassured by the answer given in question time today by the minister, who indicated that there has been extensive investigation undertaken in respect of that accident and there are a number of recommendations being brought forward right now. It is not true to publicly paint a picture that it happened and has been ignored or forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also fair to say that the government shares some of the concerns about the capacity of the CAA, in the form that it was in, to deal with this air safety issue. That is why significant action has been taken to provide some restructuring and some separation of issues, such as the airworthiness section and the licensing section. It is my understanding that the structural changes that bring about those separations are already in place. If that is so, the honourable member for Hume was giving examples on radio this morning and again in this parliament about practices that no longer exist. They are colourful illustrations of the point, but the point needs to be made that they are no longer in existence. So, to the extent that that is the case, it is worth my making that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I share the minister's acknowledgment of the regard in which everybody holds Peter Gration, who has been appointed to the position of chairman of the CAA. He has a track record of getting things done, and he has put this matter at the top of his priority list. I think we can expect some very prompt implementation of changes or assurances that a number of these matters that may cause concern are being and will be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said those things, let me flag in this discussion something about which I think we all have to do some thinking. While we may have had these wonderful safety procedures and records, the fact of the matter is that flying around Australia is not all that difficult by world standards. It is basically a flat country and most of the major airports are on flat land near the seaboard. Whether it is by good management, good luck, good geography or whatever, we have enjoyed an enviable safety record, and the world acknowledges that. But the number of aircraft flying around in the skies over Australia is increasing. With population shifts and increasing wealth, lots of changes are taking place in commuter patterns and the pressure on airports is increasing. It is incumbent upon government and the industry to ensure that the infrastructure and the standards are in place, be they improvements in airports, in air traffic control, in training of the people involved or a higher degree of safety and responsibility on the part of the operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I happened to be in south-west Tasmania last week and I flew back from a remote airfield to Hobart airport. As we approached the airfield, I had headphones on and was listening to the air traffic discussion between my pilot and air traffic controllers. As we were flying over Hobart, there were several aircraft in the sky. The pilot was told where they were and to keep his eye out for them. He was looking around everywhere, and so was I. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the point is that maybe that is not satisfactory over time. Perhaps relying on pilots doing visuals under 3,000 feet will not be satisfactory in time, particularly if the equipment in the aircraft is not up to that. I think a lot of work needs to be done, as there are more and more of these aircraft flying around, to ensure that these standards are developed and maintained. I do not think the MPI is of substance, but I am happy to make that contribution. </PARA>

The estimated cost of the proposed refurbishment is $10.5 million at July 1993 prices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report mentions that the existing college building, although partially extended and later renovated, is nearly 50 years old and the standard of living-in accommodation and training facilities reflects this.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AFP examined a number of options, including the use of a surplus school and the integration of the college with a new AFP headquarters.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's report concludes that the extent of the proposed refurbishment is necessary due to the age and condition of the building and a requirement to provide a modern, integrated training establishment offering facilities consistent with contemporary standards and expectations. Therefore, the standard of accommodation proposed is consistent with a need to cater for the diversity of personnel attending training courses. Similarly, the extent of the proposed upgrading of building services reflects the requirement to repair and maintain deficiencies in existing systems and to modernise them, where necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has made recommendations concerning a number of design and consultative matters. On the question of fire safety, the committee recommends that the involvement of the ACT Fire Brigade should continue throughout the design and delivery of the completed project. The committee also recommends that an energy audit of the college should be carried out 12 months after completion of the project. The committee recommends that the Australian Council for the Rehabilitation of the Disabled should be involved in the design of refurbishment work relating to access and other facilities for the disabled. The committee recommends that the AFP should formalise arrangements with child-care centres aimed at providing certainty about the availability of child-care places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said at the outset that the committee's recommendation that the work should proceed is conditional. This conditional approval stems from the impact of the law enforcement review, now completed, on the structure and functions of Commonwealth law enforcement agencies. The review had not been finalised at the time of the committee's consideration of the proposed work. We were very conscious of a case where a completed work previously examined by the committee was not required as a consequence of organisational changes occurring during construction. I am sure that the parliament would not wish to see a repeat of this type of debacle. The committee therefore recommends that the project should proceed, subject to impacts associated with the law enforcement review having no significant bearing on the scope of the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second report which I have tabled deals with the partial relocation of the environmental test facility from its current location in the Defence Science and Technology Organisation complex at Salisbury to Port Wakefield, north of Adelaide.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this place we all understand stress; indeed, it is an occupational hazard for us. But, for the benefit of honourable members, I will try to explain what environmental stress testing is all about. It involves subjecting items of ordnance to a variety of tests which simulate their handling, transport and storage. At present, this testing is carried out at Salisbury. The transportation of environmentally stressed ordnance from Salisbury to the proof and experimental establishment at Port Wakefield poses risks to the public and Defence personnel which could be avoided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scope of the proposed work examined by the committee involves the construction of 12 test laboratory buildings, control and administrative buildings, four storage magazines and associated infrastructure. The estimated cost of the proposed work is $8 million. The committee has recommended that the proposal proceed. In arriving at this recommendation, the committee considered that environmental stress testing of explosive ordnance is essential to ensure the safety of defence personnel required to transport it and to ultimately operate the weapons system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also concluded that there is a need for the stress testing to be undertaken at a safer location, preferably in close proximity to a proofing range. Defence examined a number of possible locations and concluded that Port Wakefield is the best one. I must say that, having inspected the proof and experimental establishment there, the committee agreed with this assessment. The committee concluded that the extent of the proposed work could be justified on the basis of the specialised functions which need to be carried out by or in the various buildings proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee sought assurances from Defence on a number of safety and environmental issues. The committee was assured that the location and size of the proposed site provides adequate clearance and room for expansion. Preliminary engineering investigations have indicated that the site is suitable for constructing the buildings proposed. There will be no significant deleterious environmental impacts from the proposed facility. There will be no additional firing and associated noise from the proof and experimental establishment as a consequence of the relocation of the ordnance environmental stress facility to Port Wakefield. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, the committee sought assurances about the long-term viability of the proposed facility in the light of possible future policy changes. Based on the evidence presented to it, the committee concluded that, in the event of policy changes occurring in the future which may place the responsibility for all or some environmental stress testing of ordnance on Australian manufacturers, need for and the use of the proposed facility will remain. In terms of revenue from testing ordnance, the committee concluded that provision of a new purpose-built facility will provide considerable scope for Defence to undertake additional commercial work without the need for additional staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A feature of the construction of the new facility will be the involvement of army engineers as the primary construction agency. The decision to use army engineers was made on the basis of the relatively remote site, the benefits to be gained from training and value for money. Army engineers are presently involved in the construction of RAAF base Scherger, near Weipa in Queensland. From all reports that I have received, it is proving to be a very successful exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I mention that the proposal has considerable local government support and, indeed, strong support from the local federal member. The proof and experimental establishment has been at Port Wakefield since 1928 and considerable goodwill exists between civilian and military authorities there. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;As the member for Wakefield, I welcome this particular work. I should, however, indicate to the House that I am also a member of the Joint Statutory Committee on Public Works. As such, it could be said that I have a vested interest in this work proceeding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), has, in his usual generous manner, indicated my enthusiasm for the project, but I should point out to the House that, following the public works committee hearing into the relocation of the proof and experimental testing facility from Salisbury to Port Wakefield, something of a local controversy has erupted. It is for that reason that I would like to participate in the submission to the House and indicate to the House just what the work will do and why I welcome it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two issues currently before the House on the question of testing ordnance. The first is that there exists at Port Wakefield, which is at the top of the Gulf of St Vincent, a proof and experimental establishment. It has been there since 1928. The proof and experimental establishment is there simply so that all of the service arms of the Australian Defence Force can test ordnances by firing them down the gulf. It may seem a little odd that anyone should choose to fire from Port Wakefield down the gulf towards the city of Adelaide, but Port Wakefield is in fact located at least 90 kilometres from the city of Adelaide. Even though the proofing range takes up about 30 kilometres of that stretch, the simple reality is that the firing occurs there because the Gulf of St Vincent is unique in world terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The gulf is unique in world terms in that it has lengthy and wide, sandy beaches and a huge tidal movement so it is possible for the proof and experimental establishment to fire from its location just south of Port Wakefield down the east coast of the Gulf of St Vincent and to have the projectiles land in what will be about two metres of water. They will then safely and without sustaining damage sink to the bottom. The tide goes out and the proof and experimental people retrieve the projectile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole object of the proof and experimental range is to be able to take that projectile and, having tested it with radars and having tested its trajectory, determine whether or not, since it has not been damaged in the landing process, it is distorted in any way as a result of the firing. This procedure has gone on since 1928. Since 1928 it has been possible for Defence to test its barrels, its shells, the shell casings and the projectiles in this manner. So successful has this testing been that we have now attracted work from around the globe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally, the firing process in itself causes a good deal of noise and some angst to the local community. Many members of the community are accustomed to it as it has gone on since 1928. During World War II the range was extensively used and the extensive use of the range in wartime conditions, when there was an urgency for all types of tests to occur, meant that there were occasions when ordnances that ought to have exploded failed to explode on impact and so sat on the bottom of the beach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a South Australian I must confess that the beaches now occupied by some unexploded ordnances resulting from World War II testing are beaches that South Australians would like to use for crayfishing. Just to the south of the range, in fact, there is quite a vigorous little crayfishing port called Parham. It simply will not be possible, I regret, for South Australians to occupy this east coast of the Gulf of St Vincent because since World War II there has been all of this extensive testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The controversy that has erupted over the relocation of the Salisbury facility to Port Wakefield is that there are people who believe it will result in additional firings from Port Wakefield. I want to pick up the point made by the chairman when he said that the committee was assured that `there will be no additional firing and associated noise from the Proof and Experimental Establishment as a consequence of the relocation of the ordnance environmental stress test facility to Port Wakefield.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ordnance environmental stress test facility&mdash;it may seem a little odd to have an environmental testing facility involved with munitions&mdash;is a facility that exists at Salisbury and will be relocated to Port Wakefield. Prior to its relocation, all of the testing done on ordnances in Salisbury were nothing more than environmental testing, hence the name. That is, the ordnances were either frozen or heated as the case may be. As the chairman and members of the committee and I witnessed, they are dropped off pallets to simulate what would happen if in the loading of a vessel, for example, the forklift or the pallet slipped and these munitions then fell onto the deck of the ship. Clearly it is in the interests of the Australian Defence Force and of all personnel that they explode in the barrel of a gun and not on the deck of a ship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This sort of test goes on and it goes on at Salisbury in what is now a metropolitan area. Having been tested at Salisbury, the ordnances are then carted to Port Wakefield for firing. The public works committee has endorsed the proposal to transfer the testing that happens at Salisbury to Port Wakefield and then fire the ordnances. So there is no additional firing involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the chairman has indicated, the committee has endorsed a proposal that says we are prepared to spend a total of $6 million in building the necessary laboratories so that conditions can be simulated in which the munitions can be either frozen, heated or exposed to abrasive circumstances, vibrated&mdash;as they would be on road or rail transport&mdash;and generally treated to ensure that they are stable. I just want to put on record in the parliament the simple reassurance that I offer those few people who have since become apprehensive about this work: there is no proposal, nor is there any need for additional firing from Port Wakefield. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, I point out to any South Australians who might perchance pick up the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> that the facility that now exists at Port Wakefield is generating export income for Australia and for South Australia. I regret that some people have been inconvenienced by it. I restate that the area is already, as it were, polluted by World War II firings. No pollution occurs now, since the projectile and the trajectory are always monitored when it is fired. Defence knows precisely where the projectile has landed. It can be marked on the map so it is easy to locate or at least Defence knows the general area where it is if it cannot be located. Currently, because we have guns that now fire over a much larger distance, some firing occurs from the west coast of the Gulf of St Vincent across to the east coast. I know that has caused some dislocation, some concern to Defence and some concern to my constituents over the past two weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is regrettable that this extended firing to do a particular job for Defence occurred with the announcement of this proposed change to the Port Wakefield range. As a result of that, some of my constituents are certain that their federal member deceived them in his comments to the public inquiry into the location of the proof and experimental station. Mr Deputy Speaker, I can assure them, as I assure you, that there will be no additional firing and there will be an opportunity for additional export income as a result of this work. As a South Australian, I welcome it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time the debate was suspended I was in the middle of explaining why the child-care cash rebate is such a great initiative. This initiative will help families with the cost of child care associated with employment, training, education or job search. A feature of this support is that it will not be income tested. It will provide up to $61.20 per week for two or more children. Unlike a tax concession, the cash rebate is claimed as the cost is incurred rather than up to 18 months later. That is why it is fundamentally fairer than a tax concession. It does not favour high income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cash rebate will make sure that women with low incomes also benefit, including women in part-time work or studying who have no taxable income. It will not force low income women unnecessarily into the work force. An estimated 230,000 families will benefit at a cost of $149 million a year over the next four years. The child-care rebate legislation which establishes the child-care cash rebate was not opposed by the opposition. I thank the opposition for that. I urge honourable members to support this current legislation, which will implement changes to the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill so that the child-care cash rebate scheme can be administered by the Health Insurance Commission. </PARA>

I was also very pleased to hear the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) say that some very good points are contained in this legislation. I commend her for those comments. But as is often the case, the honourable member for Moncrieff was rather selective in some of her comments. At one point the honourable member for Moncrieff actually claimed that she had been misrepresented by the honourable member for Moreton. I would like to take up that issue.

<PARA>The honourable member for Moncrieff said that she had been misrepresented in that she supposedly led the charge. In my book, if you lead the charge you are obviously the one in front. Back in 1993, on 20 October, the honourable member was the first person to speak for the coalition&mdash;therefore leading the coalition discussion&mdash;in demanding that a means test be imposed on the child-care cash rebate. She was, I reiterate, the first speaker from the coalition on this bill and therefore in the lead. I would like to quote a couple of passages from that speech on 20 October 1993. The honourable member for Moncrieff stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition will not oppose the bill but will move to amend it, to cap the payment of child-care rebate, to remove the child-care for millionaires element. Furthermore, under the coalition's proposed scheme, a rebate would not have been payable beyond a combined income of $60,000, with payment of a rebate tapering out between $50,000 and $60,000.</PARA>
<PARA>The speech goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>being the honourable member for Moncrieff&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">point out that the coalition supports capping the level of income able to be earned in order to be eligible. For many years there has been increasing community recognition of the expense and the inequity of open-ended government assistance and the desirability of targeting those in most need. The coalition believes that this approach would be an appalling misuse of scarce public resources and unnecessarily limits the capacity of government to provide adequate assistance to those in genuine need. </PARA>
<PARA>We are talking about assisting those in genuine need. The amendments here that we are discussing today are largely, as we have heard, of a minor procedural nature. They provide for the recovery of costs incurred by the Commonwealth in the provision of rehabilitation programs. The amendments in section 23, as we have heard, will serve to strengthen legislative support for the recovery of costs by the Commonwealth for rehabilitation programs provided to clients with compensation. The bill further goes on to require decision makers under part 3 of the Disability Services Act to notify persons affected by their decisions of the making of those decisions and of the right of appeal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 3 of the bill relating to the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 is consequential on the passage of the Child Care Rebate Act of 1993. The amendments will provide that, consistent with the existing scheme of operation of part 5 of the HIC Act 1973, part 5 makes adequate provision in relation to the child-care cash rebate functions of the commission. Part 5 of the Health Insurance Commission Act deals with financial matters. So accordingly the HIC will be required to prepare estimates of receipts and expected expenditures related to the performance of its child-care cash rebate functions; to expend its moneys in relation to those functions only in accordance with approved estimates of expenditure; to apportion its assets and expenditure appropriately and to open bank accounts required to enable it to properly handle its moneys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is most noteworthy about this bill is that the Labor government has recognised that it is difficult for women to participate on an active basis in the workplace. We have had that come to our attention on many occasions. Women are often constrained by access to affordable child care. I reiterate here something that has been often stated by the women members of this parliament: women are over 50 per cent of the population and have a diversity of skills and abilities to offer which are extremely valuable to the economy. Yet, in many instances we are unable to make use of that incredible pool of knowledge. The limited access in the past to affordable child care has been part of the problem. The cash rebate will substantially increase the ability and the affordable opportunities of women who wish to work or undertake further education and/or participate in training programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us be realistic. This legislation now allows many more women to contribute their great talents and capabilities to our national growth and future prosperity. We have to forget tagging child care as a welfare issue. It is not a welfare issue any more. It is a vital part of this government's approach to building and rebuilding a well skilled and capable work force in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The child-care rebate forms part of the Labor government's child-care policy, which is an extremely comprehensive package that recognises that most parents, at some stage of their working lives, will require affordable access to quality child care. In 1983, when this government was elected, there were approximately 46,000 child-care places available. By the end of the 1993-94 financial year&mdash;10 years later&mdash;that will have increased to approximately 237,000 places. This government promised to meet all demand for work related child care by the year 2001. From the results to date, and with the implementation of the child-care rebate scheme on 1 July 1994, this promise is well on target. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Investing in the nation</EMPHASIS> that the child-care rebate recognises that the cost of child care is a legitimate expense for parents earning an income. As with other expenses incurred when earning an income, it will not be means tested. The introduction of this scheme recognises at long last the costs that are borne by parents&mdash;I reiterate `parents'&mdash;and particularly mothers in earning an income. This bill recognises that all working families are entitled to some form of recompense for the cost of work related child care. However, to ensure that this recompense was equitable and that benefits flowed to lower income families, a decision was made to introduce a cash rebate so that families could claim as the expense was incurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will outline the main features of the child-care rebate scheme. The rebate will be payable by mail or in person through Medicare offices of the Health Insurance Commission with effect from 1 July 1994. The rebate will be available to parents who are employed, studying, training or looking for work. It will be paid for any work related child-care expenses for children under 13 years of age. After the first $16 of weekly child-care costs, families can claim 30 per cent of their costs up to a ceiling of $110 per week for one child in care and $220 per week for two or more. The maximum weekly rebate will be $28 per week for one child in care and $61.20 per week for two or more children in care. The rebate will be payable over and above child-care assistance and it will not be income tested. All work related child care in the formal child-care sector will be eligible&mdash;long-day care and occasional care centres, family day care, outside school hours care and vacation care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Informal child care is defined as child care that is not currently eligible for Commonwealth and/or state funding. It can be either in the child's home or in another person's home. In the informal child-care sector, carers have to be 18 years old or over. Parents are excluded from claiming for the cost of caring for their own children. Carers can be a child's stepbrother or stepsister or other relative. Informal carers must meet state or territory regulations relating to informal care where they apply. Eligible child-care expenses must be directly associated with the provision of work related care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To participate in the Commonwealth child-care cash rebate scheme, families will need to register with the Health Insurance Commission, and it is expected that that is now well under way. To be eligible to claim the rebate families will have to satisfy some criteria. The cash rebate will be available for child-care expenses for the care of children under 13 years of age incurred by families where both parents are engaged in one or more of the following: full-time or part-time work, study, training, or looking for work. In the case of sole parent families, only the custodial parent needs to meet one of these criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Families will be required to substantiate their work force status and the birth dates of the children they wish to register. Families will have the option of allowing the Health Insurance Commission to use Medicare enrolment details to verify birth dates of children. In order to be eligible for the cash rebate, families must be Australian residents as defined under the Social Security Act; that is, they must be Australian citizens, or have a valid entry permit, or a return endorsement, or a resident's return visa. Some categories of non-residents will also be eligible: Australian government sponsored overseas students and hardship cases. Registered families who meet these criteria will be able to claim the child-care cash rebate by presenting receipts for work related child-care expenses incurred with a registered child-care provider from 1 July 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is to be commended. It has opened great, positive initiatives, not only for the working women of Australia, those who wish to become working women and those who are training, but for families, no matter how they are made up.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill. This bill proposes amendments to the Disability Services Act 1986, the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 and the National Health Act 1953.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Disability Services Act 1986 relate to the recovery of costs of rehabilitation programs provided by the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service to persons eligible to receive compensation from other sources, such as insurers, for their injuries. Section 26 of the act relates to a client's right to have a decision reviewed by the secretary and to the right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. An amendment to section 23(5) brings the legislation into line with what has been common practice for many years. It has been the practice to serve notices in relation to the recovery of rehabilitation costs on insurers prior to the settlement of litigation between the insurer and the insured person, on the basis that the insurer is `the person liable to pay compensation' referred to in the act. It is accepted that no payment would be received until a court case had been settled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legal advice indicates that, under section 23(5) of the act, notices should not be served until it has been determined by a court, or by agreement between the parties, that the insurer is liable to pay compensation. The Attorney-General's Department has been consulted and its advice supports the need for legislative amendment. If notices were not sent early it would have a serious effect on the recovery of costs of programs provided and consequently on the revenue targets set for the CRS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An amendment to section 23(5) of the act will enable notices to be sent to insurers who are potentially liable to pay compensation well before the matter comes before a court or is settled between the parties. The second amendment to section 23 is to subsection (7) which presently requires an insurer not to pay any moneys awarded to the client until the amount owing for the rehabilitation program has been specified by the Commonwealth. It does not require the insurer to discharge the debt to the Commonwealth before paying the client. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Difficulties are often created for the CRS when the insurer pays the client without regard to the sum owing to the Commonwealth and the CRS is obliged to seek to recover the amount owing from the client. It should be noted that even when the payment is received from the insurer, the client has the right to seek to be released from any liability and could, in special circumstances, have all or part of the moneys paid to the Commonwealth refunded. Advice from the department's legal branch supports the need for a change, and the amendment requires payment of the debt to the Commonwealth before paying the remaining award moneys to the client. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third and final amendment is to section 26(5) of the act where a note has been appended to the subsection to ensure that all clients are advised in writing of their right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal if the review decision made under section 26 affirms the original decision with which the client was dissatisfied. This would bring the act into line with the requirement in a recent amendment to section 27A of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 which requires advice of appeal rights against reviewable decisions to be given in writing, and defines reviewable decisions to include decisions reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and those taken in an internal review procedure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The administrative changes to the financial provisions of the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 also form part of this bill. The amendments in part 3 of this bill are consequential to the Childcare Rebate Act 1993. These amendments aim to ensure that the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 makes adequate provision in relation to the child-care cash rebate functions of the commission. They follow previous amendments to the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 and the Health Insurance Commission Amendment Act of May 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new cash rebate system is a major part of this bill. For the people of Gilmore, the people who I represent, I would like to put it in these terms: the Commonwealth child-care cash rebate will cut child-care costs for working families. Around 230,000 families with about 350,000 children in informal and formal child care are expected to benefit from this new non-means tested payment. From 1 July this year, parents using child care while working, training, studying or looking for a job will be eligible for a 30 per cent rebate on the cost of child care. The rebate will be paid for all work related child-care expenses for children under 13. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The cost of child care is a legitimate expense for parents. Unlike other concessions for expenses incurred in earning an income, the new child-care cash rebate will not be means tested. The introduction of this scheme marks an enormous change in our attitude towards child care. It recognises that child care is an important economic issue and not just a welfare issue. I will go further to suggest that it is not a women's issue; it is a family issue which relates to our whole population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The maximum weekly rebate will be $28.20 per week, or around $1,466 each year, for one child in care. An amount of $61.20 per week, or around $3,182 each year, will be paid for two or more children. Families will pay the first $16 of weekly child-care costs and then be able to claim 30 per cent of their costs up to the fee ceiling of $110 per week for one child in care or $220 per week for two or more children. To ensure the payment of the rebate from 1 July, families and child-care providers are urged to register with Medicare by person or by mail as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because it will be paid for both formal and informal care, the new scheme will also make child care more accessible and affordable. For example, it will be paid for expenses incurred by parents using long day care centres, preschools, family day care, outside school hours care, vacation care, private child care and arrangements including paid care provided in the child's home, although parents may not claim for looking after their own children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The improvements in child care that have been made by this government in its 10 years of office, the recognition that has been given to child care as a major issue in the employment and social spheres of Australian society and the reorganisation of society that has been taking place are truly amazing. The ability of a person of my age and generation to see my male and female contemporaries having more equal opportunities than perhaps my parents did is an indication of the changes that have taken place in Australian society. Those changes have allowed more egalitarianism and a more efficient and progressive use of the human resources in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A woman going out to work was once thought to be an abomination. However, fortune and intelligence have finally broken through to the point where 51 per cent of Australia's population&mdash;that is, the female section of our population&mdash;has equal, if not more, opportunities to expand their intellectual ability than comparative males. The sickly thing is that in the past women have been suppressed. They have been prevented from reaching their economic, employment and academic goals and their intellectual capacity. They have not had the basic right of being able to reach their potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, this is changing. I would not suggest, particularly to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) and the shadow minister at the table, that at any point we have reached equality, because quite clearly we have not. The membership of this chamber is an indication of that. In order to understand the reasons why we have essential division on this issue, one should look at what has happened in the area of child care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that our moves in the area of child care and the freeing of half the population in order to enable it to play a more pro-active role in our community will change women's desire to be in this place. Quite frankly, many of them look at this place, but they do not have a great desire to come here because, in the view of many people, this place is held in low esteem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I support the suggestion of Jim Carlton, the former member for Mackellar, that we should have 50 per cent female representation by legislation. Each seat should have two representatives&mdash;a male and a female. But in order to do that we first have to realise that males and females are human beings that have responsibilities. It is of particular interest for us to realise that we are members of families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the Year of the Family. `Families' is not just a word that can be pulled out every time that, for example, the National Party wants to say something in order to get a warm, glowing feeling. Families are units of individuals. They are an active and dynamic group of relationships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has tended to happen in traditional society, both in the developed and undeveloped world, is that an undue part of the physical work has been taken on by one sex in that relationship, predominantly the female sex. In order to even that up, we need to have a realistic approach to the division of labour within the family and the home. No-one can expect an individual to go out and work a 40-hour week or longer and then come back and do the same thing in the home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, that is exactly what is happening. To the extent that I can possibly do it, I will attempt to alleviate that in my home, because I know that I am also guilty of it. In the last 20 to 25 years, the women in our families have been in the workplace and done their fair share of bringing home the bacon via a pay packet, supplementing the family income or even being the sole income earner. They have also been expected to look after the children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Child care liberates women and enables them to reach their potential in the employment market if they so desire. Their being liberated and not tied to those targets requires financial backing, which comes from the provisions of the new child-care cash rebate scheme in the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill. Its set-up through the use of the existing infrastructure&mdash;that is, Medicare, et cetera&mdash;is most appropriate. It avoids the duplication of infrastructure, which all too often happens, and bureaucracies, which may not be beneficial for the long-term economic efficiency of our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I highlight the fact that this government has really delivered in the areas in which we have promised to deliver. I take a great deal of pride in standing up here as a member of the government. In the March election, I was one person who put our record on child care as one of the reasons why I should be elected. Our promises of continued action in the area of child care is one reason why we should be returned to office again and again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has delivered and continues to deliver on one of the most important issues that faces working families. We have delivered in a way that is fair and equitable. We have delivered in a way so that there is social justice. We have delivered in a way so that the people who need access will obtain access. I suggest that those people who are responsible&mdash;and I see one of them in the chamber, the parliamentary secretary at the table&mdash;are owed a great debt of gratitude by the people of Australia because of the way that they have come forward and put this to the Australian people in such a good and wholesome fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can give an indication of the child-care costs that confront the average family. The arrangements that are made in this case are a little peculiar; nonetheless, this example is relevant. A certain woman I know wished to have significant time with her children, so instead of working five days a week she chose to work three days a week. Her remuneration was such that, after she had paid child care for the three days that she did work, she ended up with $150 a fortnight. These arrangements will substantially change that. I know about that example because that woman happens to be my wife. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that to a woman with intelligence and career objectives there is more to life than just her children. It is not a case of fleeing from those children; it is a case of having conversations with people over the age of three and having interests broader than just the marital home, the garden and the shops. Employment allows these women to have a broader perspective on life. It allows them to have broader interests. It allows them to relieve some of the strain that comes from being a parent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I love my children very much. I hope that the relationship is reciprocal and that it is very loving and close. But I can assure honourable members that 24 hours straight with the little beggars and one starts to climb the walls. There is need for people to have forms of escape. Employment is one of those forms of escape. It is a form of escape which allows people to develop their own interests and further their own intellectual capacities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that these arrangements will enable more people to be involved in our work force and enable us to have a very compassionate attitude towards the new family that is evolving in the Australian social scene. The new family in the Australian social scene involves two people working, whether it be full time or part time, and having broader relationships outside. Hopefully we will be able to tie in with the broader concept of what previously enriched our lives&mdash;that is, the broader family context of grandparents and other family members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the government for its action in this regard. The responsibility has been heavy. There are a lot of competing needs in the community. For this government to recognise that child care is one of the major issues in the last decade of this century puts us in good stead to allow all members of our community and all members of our society to participate at a level commensurate with their ability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this enables women to advance to the higher ranks in business, if this enables women to go forward and take their rightful place in our community, I think that in the longer term, when in the future the history of this nation in this century is told by honest players&mdash;people such as Manning Clark&mdash;we will find that this Labor government will be held up in high esteem as a government that cared about its people, both male and female.

The Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 is an omnibus bill that covers a number of amendments to various pieces of health and human services legislation. In particular, the amendments made by part III of the bill are consequential to the Childcare Rebate Act 1993. That act was another important step to ensure that child care is affordable for all working families. From 1 July this year parents using child care while in employment or while training, studying or looking for work will be able to claim a cash rebate for part of their child-care expenses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An estimated 230,000 families with 358,000 children will benefit from that scheme. It would be good if the honourable member for Moncrieff could take note of these particular statistics. This piece of legislation will help 230,000 families with 358,000 children. That is something that she ought to be a bit interested in rather than nattering about on the side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth cash rebate will be administered by the Health Insurance Commission on behalf of the Department of Human Services and Health, and the cash rebate will be payable by mail or in person through Medicare offices of the Health Insurance Commission. I think that that is a very worthwhile social reform. In fact, I believe that in years to come this government will be remembered for its initiatives focusing on supporting the family unit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my years as a member of the federal parliament, it is hard to remember a more popular initiative than the child-care cash rebate. This fulfils another promise that the government made during the election campaign. I have received hundreds of phone calls from constituents commending the government on this initiative. I think the opposition would be hard put to find one parent who did not believe that he or she needed this assistance. Even among the opposition, only one honourable member has stood in this House today to oppose the legislation, and I think that, in a sense, that might be voting with the constituents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that opposition members are carping that this initiative should be income tested when in the same breath they are telling taxpayers that they want to introduce  income splitting so that well-to-do people earning over $100,000 a year can pay less tax. I do not know where they think there is any equity in that but, then again, faulty thinking is something that in recent years we have come to expect from the opposition on matters such as this. I think that opposition members know that few households with young children earn more than $100,000. In fact, according to the 1991 census, in my electorate parents earning more than $100,000 represented just 0.1 per cent&mdash;about 80 people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that, if the government can look after the rest of those people and provide some assistance, I think that is pretty fair. In fact, I believe all members of this House, be they in government or opposition, would be hard pressed to find, in my electorate or anyone else's, a great number of families in the $100,000 income bracket with children young enough to require child care. Maybe the honourable member for Moncrieff, who represents a very affluent part of the Gold Coast, has a lot of these very high income families in her electorate, but I know that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, representing an electorate in Victoria, and I, from Sydney, do not have a lot of families in our electorates that earn such incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To give some examples of the circumstances in my electorate, recently the Rockdale Council, which covers part of my electorate and part of the electorate of the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch), completed a demographic survey of the municipality. Some very interesting results came out of that, and I would like to share them with the House this evening. Of the 30,400 households, families make up 70 per  cent, and 70 per cent of the families have dependent children. Of those households with dependent children, 6.9 per cent are lone parents and, of those working parents with dependent children, 73 per cent employ the full-time use of child care in one form or another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it should be noted that Rockdale is a rather settled area, and the figures would be relatively low compared with other parts of my electorate. Nearly one quarter of the people who live in Rockdale live alone or are elderly. In the adjacent Hurstville and Canterbury local government areas, for which I have not got any figures available at present, I will hazard a guess that the number of young families with dependent children would be twice the number of Rockdale. There is no doubt in my mind that working families with children are a very significant proportion of our society. I believe, and the government believes, that they deserve the very best we can provide in this, the International Year of the Family. That is what they are receiving from this government&mdash;assistance where they need it and when they need it. It is a pity that the opposition cannot join with us in totally supporting this very worthwhile initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important aspect of this initiative is the recognition of the informal child care sector. In the past, things such as fee relief&mdash;which I will go into shortly&mdash;were available for people in the formal child care area. But for the first time this legislation takes account of the fact that a large number of people have their children cared for by family members or friends. The government is taking account of that and providing assistance in that area. I think that the overwhelmingly larger part of the provision of child care is in that informal area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's record on the provision of child care is unequalled, with record growth in the number of places&mdash;increasing from 46,000 when we came to office to 257,000 by June this year&mdash;and our interim target will be 300,000 places by 1996-97. Nevertheless, that still does not provide enough assistance in the informal child care area. As I said earlier, for the first time&mdash;and only under a Labor government&mdash;the child-care cash rebate acknowledges the work of neighbourhood baby-sitters and of grandparents. This aspect alone is a very big leap forward in assisting working parents and ensuring the provision of child care for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very interesting to note what one might say is the malappropriation of child-care services in Australia; that those parents who come from middle class areas tend to have far greater access to the formal child-care system of preschools, nurseries, family day care, et cetera. For people in working class electorates, who by dint of economic circumstances in many cases have to make a decision for both parents to work, there is far less access to a variety of child-care provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It used to gall me in the past to see those middle class areas in my city of Sydney having a disproportionate amount of child-care centres and people in working class electorates such as mine&mdash;particularly the very working class areas of my electorate such as Campsie and Lakemba&mdash;having access to mostly family day care, neighbourhood friends or relations. With family day care, people got some assistance but, if people had their children being minded in the informal area, there was no assistance at all. I think one of the great provisions of this piece of legislation is a mechanism to allow us to pay people in the informal sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has never been content to rest on its laurels. In addition to the child-care cash rebate, which we are dealing with in this legislation, we have already introduced a home child-care allowance. Today, as announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the white paper on employment and growth, we will be introducing a new parenting allowance. The parenting allowance will provide payment to one parent free of any obligation to seek work. There will be a more generous income test if the person chooses to combine parenting with paid work. It will mean an extra $59 a week for over 120,000 parents. I think that is something that members of the government and the Prime Minister himself, who has taken a very close interest in this area, can be very proud of. I hope that the opposition, in its response to the white paper later on in the week, will show some decency and embrace at least this portion of the white paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This allowance will be paid at the maximum of $132.65 per week when the recipient's income is less than $231 per week, reducing to $30 per week when the partner's income exceeds $378 per week. The home child-care allowance, scheduled for introduction in September this year, will be incorporated into the parenting allowance from July 1995. This will mean that the person receiving the parenting allowance will retain a $30 per week non-taxable payment irrespective of his or her partner's income. This allowance, along with other changes to the payment of social security benefits, including the partner allowance, recognises the right of individuals to be paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In introducing these initiatives which focus on families, the government is recognising that Australia's most valuable resource for the future development of both our economy and our society is our children. Ensuring that our children receive quality care at the beginning of their lives is one of the major priorities of the government. When that is coupled with the government's support for schooling and training after schooling, it shows that the government believes that we should be giving particularly low income families the best chance we can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are things that we can look back on in the future and say that, if we did nothing else in our lives, being part of a government that brought forward proposals such as these was a very important thing to do. These initiatives will be described as an apt response by the government in the International Year of the Family. But I think they represent much more than that. They represent an historic shift in the way we view our society working and rightly recognise the importance of the family unit to the social fabric of our nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, we can look back with pride on a number of very worthwhile initiatives that the government has introduced. It is worth reconsidering those. In 1983, when we came to office, there were 46,000 operational child-care places. There are now more than 220,000 child-care places, which is an increase of 478 per cent. We reached the figure of 220,000 in December last year. The 1993-94 budget provided for the provision of 31,000 new places, bringing the total number of places that we hope to provide by the end of this financial year to just under 240,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also provided over 26,000 places to the children of clients on JET, the jobs, employment and training scheme. This scheme assists sole parents entering or returning to the work force. The overall success rate of JET clients being assisted to find a child-care place is currently running at approximately 96 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth outlays on child care have grown from $65 million in 1983, when we came into power, to over $680 million this financial year. That is an incredible increase which shows the commitment the government has to this area. But we are still some way from meeting all the work related demand for child care. Our 1993 election commitment was to meet all work related child-care demand by the year 2000. The government has set an interim target of 300,000 places by 1996-97, and we are well on track to meet that target. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to a number of other schemes that have been outlined tonight. One of them which I mentioned earlier is child-care assistance, which was formerly called fee relief. That is provided to assist families on low and middle incomes with the cost of child care. It is provided to approximately 175,000 families. The Commonwealth outlays on child-care assistance are approximately $500 million. I think that is also something that we can be very proud of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the beginning of my remarks, there are 344,000 children from 275,000 families using Commonwealth funded child-care services. That is a proud record which the opposition, with all its fuzzy thinking, is unable, unwilling or just too plain mean to appreciate. This government has made child care affordable for ordinary working people. That was our aim and we have met that aim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My wife has worked on and off for most of our married life. I know how hard it has been from time to time for her to have access to child care. I know that the access that young married couples or other people with young families have now is far better than it was when my children were young. In the main, that is because of the activities of this federal Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend this bill to the House. It has been another milestone in the road we have taken to provide equity in our society. I congratulate the minister. I congratulate the Prime Minister, in particular, for the interest he has taken in this very worthwhile program. I think it shows that the government, unlike the opposition, is meeting the goal of the International Year of the Family. I think we can modestly say that we can hold our heads high in this particular regard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) on his contribution to the debate relating to child care.

Since joining this House I have spoken on several occasions on matters to do with health and human services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The health of Australia is a matter that must be very greatly at the forefront of concern of any government of our nation. We are a society and not primarily an economy. Health is not a product; it is a human right. I have always thought that it is a very unfortunate situation that health in Australia is a matter of such contention and that such diametrical hostility exists between the government and opposition on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The support for Medicare and the full range of public medical health is extremely widespread in Australia. The opposition parties do themselves and Australia no good by refusing to commit themselves genuinely and irrevocably to the concept of a public medical system financed by a levy on wages and salaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will be aware that I am here because I defeated the opposition spokesman on health in the seat of Lowe. Health was a major issue. I can assure the House that the fear of the health provisions of Fightback was very real and very widespread. Women especially were concerned that the opposition would in fact have a worse system than it was actually promoting in Fightback. Why does the opposition still cling to this view that health is a product like Coca-Cola or jeans, a product to be sold to those who can buy and be denied to those who cannot? I know that the opposition said that this was not its policy, but I can tell honourable members that people, especially women, were convinced that this would be the real outcome of the opposition's health policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result: major distrust of the opposition on this matter of health. This distrust continues and again, especially amongst women voters, it is a major communication problem for the opposition. Now one may ask why should I be worried if the opposition insists on clinging to a health policy outlook that is poison at the ballot box. I am concerned because I see the genuine fear and worry of many men and women on low income levels at every election. They fear the result which would see Medicare dismantled and they fear the decline in their families' health from such an act. To remove such fear I would suggest that the opposition parties actually have a change of heart and embrace the public health system as exemplified by Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Realistically, I am not too confident that the opposition will take such excellent advice. In urging this I am not saying that there is no place for private health; there is. I am not opposed to private health insurance or private hospitals; they have their place. Australia is a success because we can fit together public and private facilities into one society. By taking this cooperative approach, we include everyone in our vision of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians want to be included and they want to belong. They want security. They want a decent standard of living where they do not have to worry that illness will crush them either financially or socially. We Australians are actually different people from others in the world who speak English. Our society is a serious success because of our peculiar avoidance of the pitfalls of class, race and religious bigotries. How this came about is a good question for historians. I will not pretend to know, but what I do know is that we are different because we look upon each other not as competitors for scarce resources but as cooperators in building a decent place to live. This smooth plain of cooperation is not perfectly smooth. Some Australians still see health and human services as a great field for profit and enrichment. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But clearly we have a situation where child care has gone to two different categories: people who have been needing more facilities and people who have been needing child care not only for employment but for the seeking of employment. Clearly there has been a great need to see a financial commitment by the government to those who pay for child care. Of course, there was the previous situation where people were able to get child care allowances that were means tested. For people who had been using other means of child care, be they private arrangements, nannies, grandparents, et cetera, there was a difference that had to be met. Clearly we now have a situation where the government has met this need by bringing in the new child-care arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to make some reference to AIDS, if I may. I hope this will be in order, Mr Deputy Speaker, with regards to the fullness of this bill. As many members are aware, the AIDS epidemic is spreading across the world. Scientists are losing hope that an effective vaccine will be developed in the foreseeable future. In some African cities one in three of the population is HIV positive. Blood can only be accepted from primary school children. The World Health Organisation estimates that 45 million people will be HIV positive within six years. In Europe and America there are signs that the disease is spreading, especially among the poor. Around the world there are about 15 vaccines under development. However, it may not be possible to find one that protects against all of the strains of the virus. </PARA>

Unfortunately, all the various international agencies agree on these shocking statistics. This is a matter of the gravest concern for Australia and the world. We would be well advised to take this epidemic very seriously and not delude ourselves that this is a matter that only affects a certain group of people and, therefore, the rest of us need not worry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This House has a serious moral duty to the nation to look at this problem in a totally scientific way and not to wrap itself up in smug self-righteous attitudes. Even if we limit ourselves to the most basic level of our economic ties to the rest of the world, I would remind the House that half the world's population in 1994 was to be found in just five countries: China, India, the United States of America, Brazil and Russia. These countries have a major problem with AIDS and not one of these countries is handling the epidemic very well at all. The capacity for destruction by AIDS is unparalleled in modern history. For example, in Brazil, Haiti, Thailand and 13 African countries, the AIDS epidemic will slow growth rates so dramatically that, by 2010, these countries will have 101 million fewer people than had been estimated in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those who smugly suggest that AIDS is just an epidemic amongst homosexual men, the Asian Development Bank has recently written that the AIDS epidemic in Asia will be a higher threat to women than to men. The epidemic is certain to have major socioeconomic implications for Asia and the Pacific. At present, more Asian men than women are infected with HIV. But there is strong evidence that social conditions in Asia, particularly south Asia, may lead to a trend where many more women become infected. The reasons for expected rising infections among women are biological factors: frequent births, which may require blood transfusions; and the low status of women, which inhibits them from acquiring the means to protect themselves from AIDS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia the situation is a lot better than in any other country. Proper scientific approaches to the problem have existed from the beginning. Adequate education, funding and community concern have resulted in a serious assault on this epidemic.

The typical, sensible, bipartisan Australian approach has paid off and I, for one, am most anxious to see that this continues. </PARA>

Australians have a proud record in medical matters. Our predecessor parliaments have always been supporters of medical research, be it for polio, diphtheria or any other communicable disease. I am confident that this 37th parliament can be worthy of its forebears and stay up to the mark on this epidemic of AIDS for as long as necessary. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

But the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) has approved the policies and the legislation, and the department has been involved scrupulously, with the very hard work of our officers, in putting forward the legislation. That point made by the honourable member for Moncrieff was a furphy. She was trying to raise the point as though the minister were not concerned with the issues involved here. The minister is very much concerned with the issues raised here in this bill and with issues that honourable members have raised, including those raised by the honourable member for Moncrieff.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of my colleagues tried to reply to the issues raised by the honourable member for Moncrieff. She took a number of points of order and made a personal explanation because she did not consider that they had properly dealt with her arguments. She accused them of not referring to the right policy. But, of course, one of the problems we have with the opposition is that it appears to consider it is okay to means test some things but not others, without any rationale on its part whatever. I could not follow why she objected last year to the means testing of certain things and then objected when certain other things were not means tested. We seem to have some confusion on the part of the opposition as to this whole issue of what is to be means tested and what is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, it would be good to have a general philosophical position on this, but that is a vain hope, given that the opposition as a whole has very little philosophical position on social issues. It needs to think through some issues. Maybe it could learn some things by talking to some of the conservative parties in other countries that have moved beyond the New Right Thatcherist ideas in economics and have tried to do something on social policy. The opposition might actually develop some social policy and we might be able to have a debate in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) mentioned during question time today, it is no good the opposition simply picking one little piece and saying, `You should spend more money on that or you should spend more money on another little policy' when its key economic spokespersons are saying, `Cut out billions of dollars, $5 billion, $6 billion or $7 billion, from the budget,' which essentially means the social budget. That is what it means and meant in the last election: the social budget. If the opposition were going to cut that money out of the social budget, it cannot come in here and demand all sorts of extra spending. That basically was the argument from the honourable member for Moncrieff. Her argument was that we should spend more money on the parent who is at home, whether the wife or the husband, and looking after the children. </PARA>

What differentiates the Labor Party from the opposition is that we have always been involved in balancing social justice and economic development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The balance between social justice and economic development is the key issue. That is what government is all about in the modern world: finding the right balance, not ignoring social priorities, drastically cutting things and creating an underclass as Mrs Thatcher did in Britain. The British people are still suffering years afterwards and will probably continue to suffer for many years into the future because of the lack of concern for social justice and social policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Moncrieff talked about recognising the role of women or men at home. The government has issued a number of papers talking about the recognition of their role and has actually put into place the home child-care allowance. We had another interesting development today with the presentation of the white paper. What do we see in the white paper? We see a further development of this matter by the government with the introduction of the new parenting allowance, which will further support parents at home. What is most interesting is that this is a clear social justice measure. In particular, 120,000 low income families in Australia will receive an extra $59 a week on average. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about social justice in action. We are not getting up and saying, `This ought to be done,' and then turning around without the money to pay for it because the economic spokespeople are trying to please certain right wing think-tanks around the place by talking about massive cuts to the budget. Those opposite cannot have it both ways. The opposition might have dropped Fightback and it might have dropped all of its policies, but it will not be allowed to get away with the idea that it can talk about big cuts to the budget on the one hand and about social concern and social policies on the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why did the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) issue a statement attacking the central concept of the jobs compact the other day? He attacked that idea. In attacking that idea what was he talking about? He was talking about the central social justice idea to assist unemployed people. He did that because he recognised that if his party were in government it could not afford it. If one looks at the Fightback package, one will see that the coalition was going to significantly reduce spending in these areas. How then would the unemployed, especially the long-term unemployed, have been able to benefit?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When talking about people's choices, as the honourable member for Moncrieff did, especially choices for women, the basic standard of living which we are able to supply is of crucial importance. The choices people face are not abstract; they have to be real. They have to be based in real, concrete, economic and social circumstances. It is no good saying to a person facing abject poverty, `You've got some choices.' That person has to actually be offered concrete assistance to make those choices real. This is what this government is doing in relation to child care and in relation to assistance for women, and in certain cases men, staying at home looking after children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do believe in the right of choice, contrary to what the honourable member for Moncrieff said. But unlike the opposition, which talks about the need for there to be a right of choice while not providing any substance or any money to support social programs, we actually find the money by a difficult balance between economic and social requirements. That is what is most important with respect to those choices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I totally reject the allegations made by the honourable member for Moncrieff. We are doing more all the time to offer those choices. Choices are becoming increasingly available to women who stay at home, who seek opportunities in the work force or who participate in society in other respects. They are becoming increasingly available to them because of the policies of the government in relation to child care on the one hand and to support for those who choose to stay at home on the other. It is not a question of not offering equal choices. Equal choices are being offered and people will be increasingly taking them up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the point I made a moment ago. There is no point talking about choices in the abstract. There has to be a firm, serious commitment to funding. There has to be a firm, serious commitment to working out the bureaucratic arrangements that will deliver these things. That is what government is about. It is not just a question of making pronouncements. These things are never easy. It is difficult to administer these things properly and to make sure that the people who deserve them get them. Of course, we are open to suggestions from the opposition in relation to these matters, but what we have had from most of the spokespeople from the opposition is a refusal to even concentrate on these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Moncrieff talked in her speech about the participation of women in parliament. That is a very distant topic from this bill. However, she managed to talk for five minutes on the participation of women in parliament. We will assume that the debate was wide ranging at that time. She protested about the honourable member for Lowe talking about health on the health bill, yet she talked for about five minutes on the participation of women in parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is a very important matter. The honourable member for Moncrieff made the interesting point that there are few women in parliament who were here at the time when they were actually rearing children. I think that is a matter that needs some attention. With respect to the participation of women in parliament, obviously the provision of significant child care and the provision of allowances and support will be very important in assisting them to participate more fully in society, including in the political process, and therefore be able to take up opportunities when they arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not disagree on that point. I do not think the honourable member should try to make some political point against the government by claiming that it is not interested in supporting women who wish to stay at home. As I have mentioned, the allowances announced today further support that, especially for low income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to refer to some other important matters which are quite relevant to the child-care allowance. It is very important for people to recognise that they can apply for this allowance now, and they should be applying for it. It is clear that the benefit from that allowance will further strengthen families and the participation of women and their role in society. I strongly urge people to become aware that they can apply for the allowance now. We need to do more to encourage people to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by congratulating the government and the ministers involved for putting forward the white paper, especially for what it does for the general issues of social justice that we are discussing here. The white paper makes a tremendous contribution in the area of social justice. It gives a massive $6.5 billion injection to a whole range of programs: programs to assist women, young people in trouble and a whole range of disadvantaged people&mdash;those from non-English speaking backgrounds, Aboriginal people, those with disabilities and the homeless&mdash;and, most importantly, programs to assist the long-term unemployed to get back to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this the International Year of the Family it is very important to realise when we are talking about helping people&mdash;especially women&mdash;that most of us participate in society because of our family circumstances. For example, if in a two person family both people are long-term unemployed, desperation occurs&mdash;a certain sense of inability to participate in and be part of society. The formation of an underclass of people who feel rejected by society is a very serious matter. The white paper has addressed that, which is a very good thing. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it would be appropriate at this point to put a couple of points straight that have arisen in the course of debate. Early in my speech on the second reading I made reference to the fact that I was disappointed that the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) was not here, given that the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill is her first bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health, the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), in his reply said that I was in error. Did I not know that, as parliamentary secretary, he did legislation? He said that the minister approves policy and legislation and then he handles it here. I am well used to the honourable member for Calwell handling legislation for the Minister for Health, but the previous Minister for Health was a senator, and I really did not expect former Senator Richardson to appear in this chamber and handle this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was disappointed that, now that we have a minister who is a member of the House of Representatives, she is not here. This is not meant in any way to denigrate the parliamentary secretary; he knows I would not do that. But I just remind the parliamentary secretary that this arrangement can lead to an unsatisfactory situation. There have been times in debate in the committee stage in this House when certain matters have been raised&mdash;amendments and explanations and so on&mdash;and the parliamentary secretary was not in the best position to reply for the government. Instead, we were given an indication that the government could well consider favourably the amendment but was not capable of doing it here because the minister was in the Senate. So the House had to pass legislation which, it was acknowledged, could be deficient and send it to the Senate to be fixed up. I do not think that is something that any member of this House would like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to knock on the head the idea that, because a minister has a parliamentary secretary, that minister has absolutely no obligation to this House and that the parliamentary secretary has the obligation to be here for legislation. I recommend to the parliamentary secretary at the table that he take a look at the record of, for example, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean). That minister also has a parliamentary secretary, the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon). Nevertheless, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training makes a point of reading his own second reading speeches, of being present for his own debates, of moving his own replies to second readings, and carrying any debate that there may be in the detailed consideration of the bill. I lament the idea that ministers no longer have any sort of obligation to the parliament when it comes to the handling of their own legislation. That is enough on that subject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming to the subject of the debate, the parliamentary secretary seemed to be very proud of the fact that the home child-care allowance is funded. I remind the parliamentary secretary that rebates for child-care costs, where they are costs of employment, and equivalent payments for home child-care allowance were part of Fightback. Those very generous measures were part of the opposition's policy before the last election. It was after we had announced the details of our policy that the government came up with policies that it certainly had never mentioned before but which appeared to be equivalent to the coalition's policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the government did not mention at any stage, of course, was that it was going to fund the home child-care allowance by cashing out the dependent spouse rebate. I have already indicated that there is no problem with that. There have been many reports over the years that show that the dependent spouse rebate was a very poorly targeted benefit and that this is a better way of targeting it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, those who might have been tempted to vote Labor, believing that there was going to be increased support for the family where a parent was full time at home playing the parenting role, have been disappointed because there is a cashing out of the benefit. There is no increased benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish I could share the parliamentary secretary's enthusiasm for the announcement of the parenting allowance today.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since 1 April 1994 amendments to the fringe benefits tax have been implemented which have caused considerable concern throughout the community. Small businessmen and women have been placed in a position where company owned assets previously exempt from the fringe benefits tax now qualify. The concern which has been raised with me has been initiated by an elector within the Cowan electorate, Mr Brian Aitken of Kingsley. He has asked ask me to present his case to the parliament. Needless to say, this is only one example of the many businesses within the electorate of Cowan and throughout Australia that are concerned about these amendments. Mr Aitken writes:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am an insurance broker contracted to a major insurance broking organisation, and my wife and I operate through a proprietary limited company servicing insurance needs for some 500 clients, utilising the facilities, systems and backup of a major insurance broking house. I have an office at home, however by necessity, and convenience, travel to the inner city office where I utilise the computer systems and clerical backup which is provided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is necessary for me to use my car regularly in carrying out my business and to be available on demand to visit any such clients as may require my services from time to time. In addition I need to be mobile to respond to any new business opportunities that may arise. I have chosen to purchase a regular parking spot close to the office (approximately 200 metres). For that I pay $225 per calendar month. Up until 1 April 1994 that cost was a tax deduction as a business expense reasonably incurred in earning my income. From 1 April 1994, with the cynical wave of a pen, the federal government has determined that such an expense is deemed to be a fringe benefit in that the parking paid for my company (as indeed the vehicle is owned by my company) and the company must pay fringe benefits tax on the cost of the parking.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Aitken continues by pointing out the bureaucracy which he is now facing to resolve the issue. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am told that if I can establish that I am absent from my office in town for more than four hours per day I may be exempt from this impost, but as I maintain a regular parking spot this will be difficult to establish. In addition, because of the nature of business, such activity, whilst it may be the case for several days, may not be the case on every day and therefore I will need to prove such absence from the office and apportion a comparative cost accordingly. The clerical and accounting costs involved in such an exercise will be horrendous.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst it may be that some people could obtain a fringe benefit by having an employer pay for parking in an area close to an office, I am not completely convinced of this. I fail to see how it could be deemed that I am obtaining a fringe benefit whatsoever by my company paying for a parking spot which is necessarily required to enable me to carry out my duties as a director of that company and consequently earn my income. I see the cost as merely another cost in running a motor vehicle which is a necessary tool of my trade and of my business. My wife and I own a family car which we use for such family occasions, and rarely is the business car used for such private activities.</PARA>
<PARA>While the amendment to the fringe benefits tax that Mr Aitken is alluding to may have seemed a good idea in theory, it is obvious that it is yet another example of the ineffectiveness in practice. Like the Family Law Act and the Child Support Agency, it seemed like a good idea at the time. It is typical of this Labor government. It has clearly stated the myth again this week that it is supporting small business. I would cite Mr Aitken of Kingsley as an example of the way the Labor government ignores the needs of small business and the business community as a whole in Australia and continues to run rampant through the ever decreasing stock it has with small businesses. I ask that the government, if it is sincere about looking after small business, consider the needs of small business in the fringe benefits tax area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to applaud yet another significant milestone for Central Queensland and for Gladstone, which is rapidly becoming the new age industrial capital of Australia. On 8 March I attended the official opening of Queensland Cement Ltd's $33 million expansion at Fishermans Landing just north of Gladstone in my electorate of Hinkler. QCL, which is owned by the Swiss based Holderbank Group, is Queensland's largest manufacturer and distributor of cement and is one of Australia's major marketers of cement products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The expansion at Fishermans Landing involves the addition of state-of-the-art cement milling, storage, bagging and palletising facilities. The new installations complement the established limestone mine at nearby Mount Larcom, also in my electorate, with its unique slurry transport system and existing clinker production plant at the Fishermans Landing site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those not familiar with cement processing, I will give a quick sketch of what is involved. The first stage of cement manufacture is the production of clinker. The main raw materials in clinker are limestone, silica, iron oxide and alumina. These materials are obtained from QCL's East End mine near Mount Larcom and from sandmining leases near Gladstone. The raw materials are crushed and mixed with water to form a slurry and pumped at the rate of 250 tonnes per hour, 24 kilometres via an underground pipeline to Fishermans Landing. At Fishermans Landing the slurry is dried and then fired in a special kiln to form clinker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To complete the process, the clinker is combined with special amounts of gypsum and limestone and fed into a ball mill that grinds it into a very fine, light grey powder which we commonly know as cement. The cement is conveyed to a 20,000-tonne silo and is ready for dispatch either in bulk or bag form for distribution to Central and North Queensland or for export. The expanded facility has meant that QCL Gladstone can produce and dispatch approximately 600,000 tonnes of cement a year, or approximately 10 per cent of Australia's current consumption. The new additions ensure that QCL Gladstone is an internationally cost competitive cement manufacturing plant, giving the company a competitive edge in marketing cement in Australia, Oceania and South-East Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn briefly to the human face of the company. QCL Gladstone employs around 100 skilled and dedicated people. Recent workplace changes have resulted in the adoption of many innovative work practices, ensuring an effective workplace. The company also has its own environmental policy which provides for the efficient use of natural resources, minimising the creation of wastes and, where possible, the recycling of those wastes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, I see QCL Gladstone as significant for three reasons: firstly, it sources nearly all its raw materials locally; secondly, it is a classic example of value adding, with the company now upgrading its operations to produce both clinker and cement; and, thirdly, the QCL facility at Gladstone is a prime example of regional development at its best. Would to heaven there were more QCL type initiatives in today's lacklustre white paper. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Export access is also unique in its concept as all applicants receive a visit from a project manager to evaluate their potential and suitability for the program. It is a government funded program which goes out to the potential clients. Strong bonds are often formed between the project managers and their clients through the hands-on assistance provided by the account manager concept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fundamental aim of export access is to prepare and train smaller firms to survive and prosper in the international marketplace. Launched in October 1991 as a pilot program to handle 250 firms over three years, export access has received significant funding boosts, initially after its first 12 months in the One Nation statement in 1992, and more recently with a further commitment of $8 million in the 1993-94 Commonwealth budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The $20 million funding allocated to export access will enable 1,400 SMEs to be processed by the end of 1995. The funding supports the operations of 25 project managers located in major industry associations throughout Australia and overseas Australian business offices in St Louis, Osaka and Amsterdam. Four hundred and eighty-five firms have been accepted into the program as at 11 March 1994 and approvals are proceeding at a rate of approximately 50 to 60 a month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Export access has already gained an enviable performance record from the 485 clients who have entered the program. Over 170 firms have now finished the export access program and are completing formal exit questionnaires and evaluation surveys. The first 107 surveyed have shown spectacular results, with 84 per cent of the companies successfully arranging long-term business relationships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst lead times for doing export business can be quite protracted, the 100 firms surveyed have already achieved sales of $7.6 million, a figure which they expect to reach $78 million in the next three years. These firms have demonstrated a commitment to export by appointing new business arrangements through the export access program. It is a great success and it will continue from there.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HV5">Mr WAKELIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many of my colleagues have noted this before. However, I would like to highlight the absurdity again. Simply put, superannuation for many casual employees is a farce. On 17 August 1993 the former Treasurer acknowledged the problem which superannuation poses for casual employees. Mr Dawkins noted then that relatively small amounts of money which had to be contributed on behalf of many casual and itinerant employees could be eroded by the fees and charges applied by their superannuation funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This concern was echoed by Susan Ryan, the executive director of the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia&mdash;she is well known to this place, particularly to the Senate&mdash;on 21 April 1994 in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. Ms Ryan said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are genuine shortcomings in the (superannuation) scheme, particularly as it applies to low-income and casual workers or people not in the paid workforce.</PARA>
<PARA>Our superannuation scheme is geared towards a person who works continuously for many years. Thus, it discriminates against people who are forced to work on a casual basis. It discriminates against many women whose working pattern is often interrupted by childbirth and some years in the home looking after children. It discriminates against rural and itinerant workers, who are forced by the nature of their work to move around the country and to work as the weather permits. It also discriminates against people who only pick up work from time to time, who form a growing group in today's economic climate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had some experience of the problem of superannuation for casual employees after recently employing a person for only a few weeks. Because the employee earned more than $1,000, I was required by law to pay three per cent of her income towards superannuation. As we all know, this money has to be paid into a complying superannuation fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the employee did not already have a superannuation fund. She had to open one specifically for the superannuation. By the time she reaches her retirement years&mdash;in fact, well before&mdash;the superannuation she earned while working in my office will have been eaten up in administration fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not news to the many groups which have lobbied the government to amend our superannuation rules. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation is examining the problem of casual employee superannuation being consumed by administration fees, taxes and other charges. My colleague Senator Watson from Tasmania is the chairman of that committee. He understands the chaos of superannuation as it relates to casual employees. Committee members have already received many representations from casual workers, who are concerned about their superannuation being consumed by fees and charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I note that the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations has made a submission to the Treasurer (Mr Willis) to combat the problem. The federation proposes to establish a central fund to collect superannuation contributions for part-time and casual workers. This central fund would apply to people who have a number of part-time or casual jobs throughout the years and would enable them to pay their superannuation into one account, giving them a greater chance of accumulating something for their retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of part-time and casual employees is growing each year as the structure of our work force changes to combat our high unemployment. Clearly, something needs to be done about the superannuation scheme as it applies to this growing section of the work force. Superannuation is meant to be a reward and a security net for all workers. At the moment, it is simply absurd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In conclusion, the New South Wales Farmers Federation said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the superannuation system at the moment looks as though it was designed by a committee of misdirected people locked away in an air conditioned room in Canberra and totally detached from the real world. It was!</PARA>
<PARA>Until our superannuation system is changed, many workers, particularly women and rural workers, will be at risk of receiving absolutely no benefit from the superannuation scheme which purports to help them. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most moving things that have happened to me for a long time was going through and looking at a place where Australian soldiers from the First World War and the Second World War are lying at rest. To see the graves that contain messages from the families of those people who had fallen was indeed a remarkably moving thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the recurring themes was the ages on those Second World War graves. Most, many, a lot&mdash;whatever word or percentage we would like to put on it&mdash;listed people who were 18 or 19 years of age. I think I saw three or four graves of people who were older than I am today.

But I think one of the things that motivate me in this House, and will always motivate me in this House, in terms of what I do and in terms of conflicts abroad and at home, will be what I saw in Rabaul. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that what the others were all significantly touched by was that, irrespective of the cause of war, the results are pulled out of the community itself. I would like to state in this House that whatever I can do to make sure that this country has a peaceful existence in the future, I will do. I honour those people who have passed before us and who have given their all, and I hope that all parts of this nation will forever honour the service that they have given, the sacrifice that they have made, and the fact that they cannot be back with us in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that maybe some of their people will never see the graves where they lie scattered all around the world is a tragedy. But probably the biggest tragedy is the holes that they have left.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In tonight's adjournment debate I want to raise an issue which is significant to the Greek Cypriot community within Australia. I have had considerable contact with constituents of mine with Grecian heritage over the past few weeks, but it is not my intention to canvass the Macedonian issue tonight. I want to use this time to draw the attention of the House to another issue which is important to Australians of Greek Cypriot heritage. It concerns the fact that Australian citizens of Greek Cypriot heritage are being denied their property ownership rights in the Turkish occupied part of Cyprus. Just over a third of the country of Cyprus has been occupied by the Turks since they invaded in July and August 1974, and it is estimated that some 200,000 people have been displaced as a result of the invasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of those people who were displaced following the Turkish invasion have migrated to Australia, and the latest census figures confirm that there are something like 22,000 people in Australia who were born in Cyprus. It must be remembered that many Cypriots migrated to Australia prior to the Turkish invasion. One estimate I have seen is that 10,000 Cypriots own land in the Turkish occupied part of Cyprus. These people are Australian citizens who have maintained land ownership since migrating from Cyprus or have inherited the property from their parents or grandparents. It is not unreasonable to estimate the value of this property at something between $300 million and $400 million. </PARA>

In February 1993 the then Commonwealth Minister for Land Transport, the Hon Bob Brown MP, and the Victorian Minister for Public Transport announced a revised estimate of $153m, reflecting the decision to build a dedicated freight line to Geelong. Some $118m of the total project amount is to be spent on the Victorian section of the line. National Rail has control of project management over this section. A figure of $118m was therefore given in National Rail's 1992-93 Annual Report as the cost of the project being managed by National Rail in the Melbourne-Adelaide corridor.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) The Government does not intend to amend the tariff rate of customs duty on imported billiard table cloth. The present customs duty rate is General 29%; Developing Countries 24%; Hong Kong, Republic of Korea, Singapore and Taiwan Province 27%; New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Forum Island Countries Free.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b)(i) Cloth which can be used on billiard tables is manufactured in Australia by Macquarie Textiles Pty Ltd. Macquarie Textiles do not manufacture high quality cloth, known as "competition quality" cloth, and a Tariff Concession (providing duty free importation) for such cloth was granted in 1991 but revoked on request from Macquarie on 21 September 1993. The concession legislation operating at that time required that the Comptroller-General should not allow a concession if "goods serving similar functions" were produced or were capable of being produced in Australia in the normal course of business. Locally produced goods did not need to be identical to the imported goods, it was sufficient under the system existing at that time that goods served a similar function.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That revocation decision would have meant that competition billiard cloth was subject to duty but the Government introduced a new concession system on 1 November 1992 with broader requirements than the old system.</PARA>

This contact has continued since that question was asked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia, the United States and other countries have continued their participation in informal consultations taking place under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General to explore the concerns which industrialised countries, particularly the United States, have with the deep seabed mining provisions embodied in Part XI of the Law of the Sea Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the course of these consultations it has been acknowledged by all participants, whether from industrialised countries or developing countries, that global political and economic changes since the adoption of the Law of the Sea Convention in 1982 had raised questions as to the appropriateness of certain aspects of Part XI. The major advance at the most recent consultations has been the development of a text which was put forward by key delegations including Australia, the  United States and other developing and industrialised countries. The text contains a draft agreement which identifies all major questions at issue between industrialised and developing states and which would institute a number of significant revisions to Part XI to bring it into line with current needs. The text has attracted widespread support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the most recent consultations, held from 4-8 April 1994, agreement was reached on the two major outstanding issues relating to Part XI, with all participating delegations generally accepting the resulting text. Negotiations were not, however, formally concluded because of a perception among developing countries that, as a matter of principle, those States which have not participated in the consultations should have the opportunity to study the text and express their views. The final round of the informal consultations will take place from 31 May-4 June 1994, with the first day set aside for </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">country statements on the text and the remaining three days for drafting changes and for the harmonising of language texts. Significantly, all participating delegations have agreed that the agreement will be adopted by a resolution at a resumed session of the General Assembly during the week of 25-29 July 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although some uncertainties remain, the Australian Government considers that an agreement on implementing Part XI of the Law of the Sea Convention is now within reach. This would enable Australia, as well as the United States and other industrialised countries, to give serious consideration to ratifying the Law of the Sea Convention, hence ensuring that it becomes the universally accepted law on the subject. Interdepartmental discussions have already begun the process of considering Australian ratification of the Law of the Sea Convention.</PARA>
