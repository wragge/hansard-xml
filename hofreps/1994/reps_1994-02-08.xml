<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister.  I refer the Prime Minister to statements reported yesterday that the Auditor-General believes that the government and government departments are trying to stymie his overall work. The Auditor-General commented:</PARA></TALK.START>

I ask the Prime Minister to assure the House of the certainty of the future of the audit office under his government and to ensure that the Auditor-General is given full support in the conduct of his duties. Furthermore, Prime Minister, will you instruct your ministers to cooperate fully with the Auditor-General in his inquiries?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am one of those people who think that  an auditor and an audit office are very important parts of government and accountability&mdash;I always have, regardless of who the auditor is from time to time. I think departments should be appropriately accountable to the mandate which the auditor enjoys, but I do not think any questioning by departments of what that mandate is from time to time in relation to particular requests by the auditor diminishes in any way the regard which the government has for the process of audit any more than I believe that the notion of ongoing consultations between the audit office and the Department of Finance about an auditor's resources and the productivity of the audit office should be removed from the processes of the scrutiny of the Public Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years we have seen a very high level of productivity emerge from the Australian Public Service, and there has been an efficiency dividend required of departments. The Department of Finance, which has a fairly ferocious reputation in this respect, bares down quite heavily on departments to see that that efficiency dividend is actually produced. No doubt, in all staffing matters and in the allocation of resources, all agencies of government which have a legitimate task in the service of the public of this country have got to account for their own resources. This is just as true of the auditor and therefore it should not be assumed by him or anybody else that in any way this is a government trying to diminish his resources. In fact, I believe that the Audit Act and the whole process of audit are important to the functioning of government, the resources of the Commonwealth, the allocation of Commonwealth funds and the management of Commonwealth programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the auditor is correctly reported in his remarks that the government's current attitude is to thwart him where possible, I can simply say that he is mistaken. We support the audit process, but we do not believe that the audit office itself should be removed from the process of consultation, staffing reviews and all the other things which every agency of government is subjected to.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2V5">Mr SWAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Assistant Treasurer seen reports in the media today that the government has backed away from fringe benefits tax rules on business entertainment?  What is the government's intention with regard to FBT on entertainment?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="504" SPEAKER="Gear The Hon G." NAMEID="QG4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="CANNING" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QG4">Mr GEAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen an article in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> headed `Backdown on FBT rules means lunch is still on'. This is clearly wrong. In fact, the story is very positive about the way in which the government consults and listens to the business community in designing the detail of its tax laws.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the article, Elsa Payne, a tax partner with Price Waterhouse, is quoted as saying that the reported change was in line with the federal government's recent willingness to modify its fringe benefits legislation in response to legitimate business concerns. I think that is a very favourable reflection on the way in which this government goes about the important business of law making, especially when we are trying to keep compliance costs for businesses to a minimum. The fact of the matter in this case is that there has not been a backdown. To say that there has been suggests that the government is changing or moving away from a policy that it has adopted. This is clearly not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In last year's budget, the government announced that, where an employer paid the entertainment expenses of an employee, the employer could claim an income tax deduction for those expenses and they would be subject to FBT. This change is consistent with our policy that the tax burden should be shared fairly and that all income should be treated equally, whether it is from salary or benefits in kind. We do not want to return to the bad old days of the opposition's tax policies when tax avoidance salary packages were rampant. The government absolutely stands by this policy objective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the way in which the FBT law is structured, the way in which entertainment is paid can make a difference. If the entertainment is paid using a corporate credit card, only that portion of the expense that relates to the employee would be subject to FBT. However, if an employee paid for entertainment using his personal credit card, cash or cheque and then sought reimbursement from his employer, the whole amount of the expense would be subject to FBT even though only part of it related to the employee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, the government never intended that the manner of payment should lead to different tax treatments. It should make no difference to tax liability whether the employee pays cash for the entertainment, gets a receipt and then claims it back from his employer, or whether the employer pays direct by corporate credit card, cheque or any other method. The government has recognised, in listening to the concerns of business, that because of the way the FBT law is structured there is confusion and unnecessary compliance costs in employers ensuring that only the right amount of FBT is paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has no intention of insisting business must provide all employees who are required to entertain clients, no matter how infrequently, with a corporate credit card simply for taxation purposes. Accordingly, the government will be making changes to the FBT rules to eliminate the significance of the mode of payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FBT law will be changed so that reimbursements made by an employer to an employee to cover expenses incurred by the employee in entertaining clients will be exempt from FBT and non-deductible for income tax purposes. However, this exemption will not apply to the costs of entertainment provided to the employee or associates of the employee. This change will ensure equal treatment of the provision of entertainment under the FBT law irrespective of how the entertainment is paid for. The Taxation Office will be monitoring the new rules to make sure there is no abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This case highlights some of the problems inherent in our complex tax system and the government is concerned to make our tax system more efficient, less complex, more certain and fairer to all taxpayers. This change to FBT rules is only one example. On 17 December 1993, the then Treasurer announced a tax law improvement project. This project, headed by Brian Nolan, a former second commissioner of taxation, will modernise the structure and the language of the existing income tax law so that it can be more easily understood and complied with by business and taxpayers in general.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Prime Minister inform the House of the contribution made to Australia's savings by the government's superannuation policies? Does he believe that compulsory employer funded superannuation is necessary to provide a comfortable retirement income for Australian employees? What would be the effect of cancelling scheduled increases in employer funded superannuation?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="505" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BLAXLAND" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the significant developments of the 1980s and early 1990s has been the extension of benefits of superannuation to ordinary Australians. When this government took office, superannuation benefits were exclusively given to those in the upper echelons of the private sector or to employees of the government sector; that is, the great bulk of privately employed Australians had no access to them. They were often in their design a tax dodge so that executives could get very high payments in the last year or two of their service and then go out with a very high tax-free lump sum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's policy changes have resulted in an increase in employer contributions to superannuation funds&mdash;so much so that, in the early 1980s when the government introduced the program, there was $34 billion dollars in superannuation fund assets and today there is $170 billion in superannuation fund assets, around 40 per cent of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the current schedule of increased contributions from employers, superannuation savings in Australia will more than double to well over $300 billion by the end of the decade. In 1993 dollars, the likelihood is that we will see a doubling of the current level to around that figure. In other words, we are creating a savings pool equal to three-quarters of today's national annual output.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that our superannuation policies are making a huge contribution to national savings. They always have the dual aim of complementing national savings and providing a higher income in retirement for Australia's employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appalling fact is that, over the weekend, the Leader of the Opposition threatened to destroy the program if he came to office. He backed down on his tariff policy and on his bulkbilling policy and he has said that he is just as determined now to destroy superannuation for Australian employees as he was in March last year. He said that if he came to office he would end the program of increased contributions&mdash;in other words, they would be stopped at six per cent&mdash;for employees and not go on to nine per cent and then to 12 per cent to a mature contribution, which would give them tax concessions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition in his presentation in this place and in his presentation outside gets increasingly schizophrenic. He sits in this place lecturing us on fiscal responsibility; he walks out of the place and does exactly as he pleases. He has established a pretty strong reputation out there for backing off from positions that he holds with great firmness. For example, we all remember his statement on the GST: `If people move to get rid of the GST from the package they have to remove me'. He got in a bit ahead of them, because the moment he walked out from an electoral defeat and before there was any chance of the Liberal Party meeting on the subject he had decided to abandon the GST position. So he removed the GST before the Liberal Party removed him.</PARA></TALK.START>

What would be the cost of tax deductibility for private health insurance?

According to the opposition, there is an $850 million hole which, on top of all the other elements of that hole, now sits very firmly inside Liberal Party policy, without any offsetting taxation arrangements or any credible cuts in other government outlays added to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what we now have is opposition members endlessly standing up in this place telling us that we have no responsibility in the area of fiscal policy, but when they get themselves into trouble, they get up and say anything at all as far as that is concerned. It is an $850 million hold just like that. It is no wonder that the finance spokesperson of the Liberal Party, the honourable member for Higgins, should apparently get up and, as this article says, express concern about the financial implications of revising opposition health policy. Well might the would-be deputy leader or leader of the Liberal Party express concern about that, because there is much concern that ought to be expressed.</PARA>

I can do no better to find a description of this situation than go to the Marquess of Queensberry rules, which were handed helpfully to me by one of my colleagues the other day. Rule 5 states: `A man hanging on the ropes in a helpless state, with his toes off the ground, shall be considered down'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was here when the McCabe-Lafranchi report was presented. I have a corporate memory of the history of the honourable member for Bennelong. Let me turn to the question of families. Since the government has been in office, we have significantly transformed financial assistance to families. The transformation has occurred because we have focused on the needs of children, particularly children in low income families&mdash;those families in greatest need of financial support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this government, financial assistance for children in low income families has increased in real terms by between 50 per cent and over 100 per cent, depending on the numbers and ages of the children. Family payment for two children in a low income family living in private rental accommodation is now $123 a week. That is $123 a week for two children in a low income family in private rental accommodation! The increase will be maintained as, for the first time ever under this government, all payments for children are being indexed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also followed this policy with a deliberate one of directing financial support for children to the person with primary responsibility for the daily care of the children&mdash;usually the mother. This is critical to ensure that, as far as possible, the money goes to support the children. The government now pays over $5 billion a year in direct payments to the parent caring for the children. The government will do more later in the year when the dependent spouse rebate is cashed out with a new home child-care allowance which will direct a further $1.2 billion a year to parents caring full time for children and provide many women at home with a source of independent income and recognition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition, however, is talking about going the other way with the recycled income splitting policy of the honourable member for Bennelong. Instead of focusing on families most in need, income splitting would give most benefits to families with the highest incomes. The higher the income, the more a person would gain. We have had some work done in the social security department which I think is very interesting because it shows that over a million families, nearly 900,000 of them with incomes less than $30,000, would lose under income splitting, whereas more than 600,000 families, with incomes over $60,000, would gain about $2,000 a year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In 1991 the Law Reform Commission delivered a very comprehensive report on the Australian censorship regime. Since that time, the Commonwealth and state censorship ministers have been discussing the report and the changes needed to bring our censorship system up to date. This discussion will reach a very important point next week when the ministers discuss a new classification system for film, video literature and computer games. The Commonwealth's position on this issue is guided by three basic principles: firstly, that adults are entitled to read, see and hear what they wish; secondly, however, that people should not be offended by unsolicited material; and, thirdly, that our system should afford sufficient protection, particularly to children, from harm from offensive material.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members may be aware of proposals to bring a censorship regime into place for computer games. Hopefully, this will also be finalised next week. It will be broadly along the same lines as that which applies to film and video but with one important difference: the addition of a new classification system&mdash;the G8 system&mdash;designed to cover children aged eight years and younger. That is felt to be of considerable importance in the video game area, given the particular nature of those games. The fact that violent games are now very lifelike in their representation of violence, means that we need to ensure that parents have adequate information at the time of purchasing a game to know what their children will be involved with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Flowing from the examination of computer games was the issue of similar games being available through computer bulletin boards. Evidence is now coming forward to the effect that a range of other illegal and offensive materials is available through these bulletin boards. Apparently the boards have been used to circulate stolen credit card numbers which can then be used by people to access some unfortunate person's account. Clearly, the Commonwealth needs to look at this area. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Accordingly, the minister for communications and his department, in conjunction with the Attorney-General's Department, will set up a joint task force to examine the legal and technical issues involved with bringing in an appropriate regime for computer bulletin boards and computer networks. It is a difficult area given that the technology is such that it makes regulation and any enforcement very problematic. Nonetheless, given the evidence that confronts ministers on this issue, it is incumbent upon the Commonwealth to examine what is hopefully an appropriate response. It is possible that the same model that applies to 0055 telephone services&mdash;a complaints based model&mdash;could apply to computer bulletin boards. This matter will come to a head at the censorship meeting next week and, hopefully flowing from that, Australia will have a modern and up-to-date censorship regime.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member might consider that his aim or model in life, but two better examples would be <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Crocodile Dundee</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strictly Ballroom</EMPHASIS>, which not only were great international successes and earned a lot of export dollars for Australia but also contained a uniquely Australian view of life. The honourable member for Lalor mentioned <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Piano</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Schindler's List</EMPHASIS>, which have Australian participation. They are doing very well internationally and are in the running for the Academy Award nominations, which are announced tomorrow. We hope the Australians and others involved with those two films do well tomorrow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, it is essential that we have an Australian film industry which includes Australian views and attitudes, which helps to create jobs for Australians by being made by Australians and which uses international themes as well as Australian themes. With this goal in mind, the government seeks to foster and develop the film industry in a number of ways. We have the Australian Film, Television and Radio School, which helps to train our filmmakers; the Australian Film Commission, which helps to promote our film industry; and the National Film and Sound Archive, which helps to preserve our film heritage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each of the Commonwealth agencies has international programs which try to assist in exporting our services and which try to ensure that we can sell our films and programs overseas and, in that way, help develop export earnings for the country. Our Film Finance Corporation tries to ensure that films which are being supported by the FFC have sufficient private sector support, and that is usually indicated in a good way by foreign pre-sales or distribution guarantees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One example which might be of interest to the honourable member for Lalor is a recent Australia-Japan co-venture to produce a four-part documentary series called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Heaven's Breath</EMPHASIS>. This four-part documentary series is perhaps the first time an FFC backed documentary has achieved such a high level of foreign backing while retaining Australian creative control. While the British author of the best selling book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Heaven's Breath</EMPHASIS> is a consultant to the project and will also be the narrator, Australian creative control will be maintained. In fact, not only will it be filmed in Australia but also will the post-production take place here in Australia, which is something all of us should be encouraging.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has developed a vibrant film industry&mdash;I believe we can ensure it will continue to foster&mdash;with an outstanding reputation. As some of us saw last Sunday night, Australia can consider itself second to none in many areas of the arts, whether it is in the symphony orchestra, the Chorale in Melbourne or our film industry. In the early part of the second half of this year, I will be delivering the government's cultural policy statement to outline ways in which we can try to foster a better environment for the development of the arts. That will allow us to take advantage of the Prime Minister's decision to amalgamate arts and communications&mdash;something which the honourable member for Lalor has advocated for some time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I had the honour of representing the government at last night's premiere of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Schindler's List</EMPHASIS>, referred to by the honourable member for Lalor. The Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Bennelong were present from this House. Tom Keneally's Booker prize-winning story has been brought to life by Steven Spielberg. With all of its horror and its message of hope, it is a story about this century's darkest days. We should all be proud that an Australian author has played such a role in reminding all of us that we should never forget.</PARA>

The minister pointed out quite rightly to the Australian parliament and the Australian people this year that we had a problem with lead in the environment. This was going to be the minister's great environmental stand. It was going to be what she was going to do to save Australian children as a result of the problems we had. What the minister failed to say was that Australian standards compared with the rest of the world were absolutely abysmal and had been abysmal for 10 years under this government. This government has failed to reach even the minimum standard that other countries have reached in previous years. Let us look at Australia's lead standards compared with other countries&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CU4">Mrs GALLUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are not fixing it; that is what I am coming to. In some parts of Australia we have lead levels of 0.8. What are they in other countries? In Japan and Canada, there is no lead in petrol. In the United States, it is 0.026. In other countries, it is 0.15. But what do we have in Australia? We have lead levels as high as 0.6.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the government's policy. What was decided by the government, as announced by this minister? It was decided that the price of leaded petrol would go up 5c a litre&mdash;that was going to solve the problem. Minister, why do you think the poorer families of Australia actually have older cars? Is it because they prefer to drive a 1983 Commodore or could it be that they just cannot afford to change? That is why the extra 5c a litre was unacceptable to the lower income earners and you were forced to withdraw it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For somebody who cares so much for the people of Australia, how much money did the minister actually put aside in the budget to address the lead problem? Of the $1 billion-odd that she would have got from the increase of 5c per litre in the price of petrol, she allocated $100,000 to develop a lead strategy. It was only when the Senate addressed the same problem that the amount for a lead strategy was raised to $4 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has the minister's answer been since then? The minister has come up with her old strategy of a public education campaign. We had one last year and we have another one this year. Let us have a look at it. How, according to this minister, are we going to solve the lead problem in Australia? We are going to educate the public. The advertisement that I am holding in my hand at the moment is the type of education we are giving the public: telling them that older cars can take unleaded petrol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at this advertisement. What are the makes of the older cars that Australians drive? I believe they would drive Commodores, Kingswoods and Falcons. Would opposition members not agree with my estimation of what people with older cars, and who cannot afford newer ones, drive? Yet this list does not mention the Commodore, the Kingswood or the Falcon because, to put it simply, they cannot take unleaded petrol. If they can take it, why are they not listed in the minister's advertisement?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is something even better, and that is your recommendation that older cars use super-unleaded petrol. That is a joke, is it not, minister? You are asking the person with a Toyota Corona to pay 10c extra per litre. That person might be saying, `I cannot afford the margarine or the bread because I am out of a job, but that's okay. We'll take the old car down and fill it up with petrol that costs 10c a litre extra'. </PARA>

In the 11 months she has been in this House, although her shadow portfolio is the environment, the two questions she has asked me have been about sport. We have never had any major policy initiative from her at all; we have had comments on OECD studies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me tell honourable members something about these reports from the OECD. The Commonwealth has been open and is very proud of its achievements on the provision of data on the environment. We responded with over 30 pages to the OECD, mainly on forests, fauna and protected areas. We came out extremely well on the areas of natural environment because on many occasions over the years this government has acted against the states and against the views of the opposition to protect World Heritage areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite hypocritically stand up here and ask why we do not provide statistics, when our statistics on protection of the natural environment are second to none. Had those opposite been in government, do they think that the Kakadu would have been saved? There would have been logging in the wet tropics of Queensland and the Franklin Dam would have existed&mdash;the Franklin would have been dammed. That is the hypocrisy of the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are doing extremely well internationally and domestically in protecting the natural environment because we have made a stand&mdash;without the support of those opposite on those occasions.

I am very proud of our achievements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter the honourable member raised relates to another area of statistics asked for. She was correct in trying to get information on issues such as waste, water and air. She may not understand that in the history of this country we happen to have states. States have been managing garbage for a very long time. The federal government has not been involved in those areas. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Crosio), who is in the chamber, was Minister for Water Resources when she was in the New South Wales government. The states have looked after the issues of water, air and garbage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think it is good enough for all the states to go their own way and not have standards. The reason for the information coming from Australia being quite disjointed is that each state has to provide the information.

She said that, if Western Australia does not agree to go along with the establishment of a national standards council, forget it. Let the states have a veto. Well, I will not. The difference between those opposite and us is that we will take national leadership and we will not let the states dominate environmental policy in this country. That is the fundamental difference between us and them. At the end of the day, they will kowtow to the states on every occasion. Whether it be on the natural environment, the brown agenda or lead, those opposite will kowtow to the states and we will not.

Nor will I allow it to happen in Western Australia. We are about to get involved in a major dispute with the Western Australian government on the protection of a wetland area called Creery. Has the honourable member for Hindmarsh ever heard of that? What is her view about that? Will she stand up to the Western Australian government? The answer is no. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do try to get cooperation with the states and on the lead strategy we have done that. I am very thankful for the cooperation that I have received from the states. But let me tell honourable members that, if I had not dragged New South Wales in screaming and yelling, we would not have agreement today on a reduction of lead in the atmosphere. The industry, community groups and I sat down at a round table in Parliament House and dragged the states screaming into a lead reduction strategy. It is true that lead levels in Australia are too high. We had to work cooperatively with the oil companies to bring those levels down, and we are doing that. What is the honourable member's policy in relation to this? She says that she is going to pay everybody to get the old cars off the road. I wonder whether the shadow Treasurer actually understands that policy. </PARA>

I agree with the honourable member for Hindmarsh that it is about time that the federal government took a stronger role with the states in relation to water. I will do it. Will she? I do not believe that she will. We try a cooperative approach and I think that is the way we should go. In certain states, particularly Queensland now, I get a lot of cooperation. But I did not get any cooperation from the Bjelke-Petersen government. It does not seem that I am going to get very much cooperation from the Court government in Western Australia. We have seen its attitude on Mabo and we are seeing its attitude on the environment almost on a daily basis. </PARA>

I will use whatever powers we have. Will opposition members? Will they stand up to the states? The answer is no. They have not done before and they will not now. Our record on the environment is a very proud one for me. As I go through the wet tropics of Queensland, I am very proud of the achievement of Labor governments. Sure, there will be battles. This portfolio is full of battles, whether they be in relation to the forests, whether they be in relation to trying to get national standards.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the last month we have heard some very interesting comments from the shadow minister for the environment, but I would just like to take honourable members through some titbits of what the opposition will probably be developing as its policy. First of all, she put out a statement saying they wanted the inclusion of golf courses in the national reserve system. I am sure the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) will enjoy that. The shadow minister wanted special licences to allow four-wheel drivers access to all wilderness areas&mdash;I suppose, she has been talking to the New South Wales Nats about that. She wanted the removal of the sales tax on new cars and the tax on unleaded petrol&mdash;I hope she has discussed that with the shadow Treasurer. She wants legislation to immediately remove lead from petrol and to provide funds for drivers of older cars so that everyone can buy new cars. This is a lovely fairyland. If only we could!

We are trying, but Western Australia said that it does not want to be part of Australia; it wants to go its own way.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we have before the parliament a matter of public importance which is about the total failure of the government to adequately address key environmental issues in Australia. I must say that it is interesting to listen to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) in regard to federal relationships with the states and the role that they play. I want to remind the House that certainly we work within a federal system in Australia but, when the previous Prime Minister, Mr Bob Hawke, was trying to ensure the success of this relationship so that we could have a united approach to environmental matters and a few others, what did this minister say about those attempts to get a better relationship? She said it was crass politics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister said it was crass politics to try to bring a united approach to many of these national affairs. At that stage she was talking with the environmentalists. She said that trying to improve communication within state-federal relationships to get a national approach to many of these issues was crass politics. I remind the House that what she was really interested in at that stage was internal party politics before national policy or national issues. That is typical of this minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During this debate I want to mention a couple of things which are typical of this government and are very well illustrated by this minister. The first thing that is symptomatic of this government is that it hides from public accountability. Secondly, it is a poor manager of taxpayers' funds, particularly sports funds. Today we learn from this report, put out by a group from the United Kingdom, that the government is also a very poor manager of the environment. It is not the coalition or any state government that is saying this; it is an independent OECD report commenting about Australia's achievement in regard to the environment. The report says that, out of the 21 OECD countries, Australia&mdash;after 10 years of this government, which has trumpeted what it has achieved for the environment&mdash;is ranked 18th. This is after 10 years of Labor Party government!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This minister is more interested in outward appearance than in real substance. I remind honourable members of an environmental kit that was put out in mid-1992. First the kit was endorsed by the minister. Then she decided that she had better disown what was in the kit because it was obviously totally unacceptable. Then she said, `I deny it. I don't endorse it'. But what was on the cover? Her signature and her photograph. Of course, the substance did not matter. That is also the situation in regard to the urban environment in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From this OECD report we get a very clear indication that Australia is failing dismally compared with many other countries. To put that into perspective, I note that countries such as Portugal and Spain are doing very well. During this period, not only did we not go ahead; in some of these indicators we went backwards. Who was in government during this time? The Labor Party&mdash;and this minister is responsible for this situation. We have gone backwards since 1985 in regard to several of these indicators. I think we ought to run through them again so that we are clear on where Australia stands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to carbon dioxide emissions, the report said that the United States is the highest emitter, with Canada and Australia also causing high per capita emissions. Under the minister's proposals and policies we have not been able to drop emissions. She said that she had firm environmental policies, but the fact is that they are never put into action. If they are firm policies, why are results not showing up in this independent OECD report? There are no runs on the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, there is a very poor level of public accountability. It is typical of this government that it does not want to account for its policies. Here we see a total lack of accountability with regard to its environmental policies. We already know that the minister is interested only in the outside covers of reports.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ireland and Australia did not provide data to the OECD for several indicators even though such data were officially and quite easily obtainable.</PARA>

Certainly, we did not provide the information. That is not something that the coalition is saying; that is something that the OECD report is saying. It is saying that it was not provided with information that was readily available here in Australia. This minister and her department chose not to provide it.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is going to take a long time, I think, to re-educate almost a whole generation of Australians about the nature of the balance that has got to be struck between the environment and development. It won't be easy, in my position when you visit schools on a regular basis you see just how well entrenched is the green movement, at the level of our children.</PARA>

But where are the facts? Those opposite have had their chance and have not got past first base because they just ain't got it.

<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, firstly, that was a terrific speech by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly). I congratulate her; it was well done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1993-94, together with Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2), which I shall introduce shortly, comprise the additional estimates for 1993-94. In these bills, parliament is asked to appropriate moneys to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures additional to the appropriations made for 1993-94 under Appropriation Acts Nos 1 and 2 and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The additional appropriations in these three bills total $710 million; $542.1 million is sought in Appropriation Bill (No. 3), $165.9 million in Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and $2 million in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2). These amounts are partly offset by savings in the appropriations made by Appropriation Acts Nos 1 and 2 1993-94, reflecting the government's determination to improve the efficiency of continuing programs. The savings in the appropriations, amounting to $545.5 million in gross terms, are detailed under the relevant appropriation headings in the document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Statement of Savings Expected in Annual Appropriations</EMPHASIS>, which has been distributed to honourable members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After allowing for prospective savings, the appropriations sought represent a net increase of $164.5 million in appropriations for 1993-94, an increase of 0.5 per cent on the amounts made available at the time of the 1993-94 budget. This compares with the level of supplementation sought in 1992-93 of $1,185.6 million, an increase of 3.2 per cent on that year's budget appropriations, and is consistent with the downwards revision of outlays growth for 1993-94, as announced recently by the Treasurer (Mr Willis). This lower growth in estimated outlays reflects the continuing strength of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the main areas for which the government seeks additional provisions in the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1993-94 to meet payments for the ordinary annual services of the government. Although the budget figuring made allowance for prospective wage and salary increases, it is not practice to appropriate these amounts at budget time. Funds are now required to meet increases resulting from salary increases. The amount of $150.2 million is included in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) for increased running costs for all departments and agencies, including the costs associated with agreed wage and salary increases. This represents an increase of 1.3 per cent on the funding for running costs included in Appropriation Act (No. 1). Other factors affecting running costs include transfers between financial years and some additional funding for departments associated with various government initiatives which have been previously announced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gross additional estimates of $175.7 million are sought for the defence portfolio in Appropriation Bill (No. 3). This figure includes:</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">$88.6 million for defence facilities, largely due to the payment of the defence capital contribution for the Russell Offices redevelopment; higher than previously anticipated expenditure on the acquisition of accommodation in Sydney; and costs associated with the connection of sewerage systems at Holdsworthy/Moorebank; and</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">$71.7 million for defence housing, reflecting advance rental payments to the Defence Housing Authority, the DHA, and an additional capital subvention for the DHA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increases have been offset by reductions elsewhere in the Defence appropriations, giving a net increase of some $139 million. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) includes provision for:</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">an increase of $49.3 million for labour market program assistance to job seekers and industry, reflecting the government's commitment to assist the long-term unemployed to return to work;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The balance of some $95 million in the amount included in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) is made up of minor variations across a range of programs in most departments and agencies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca). Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3). This is a particularly difficult piece of legislation to deal with, because it is an omnibus bill. It therefore contains a number of provisions which, intellectually, are difficult to link together. I suppose the only common factor is that they all relate to or arise out of the Social Security Act and, therefore, are in one bill. The social security legislation covers a wide range of issues and the provisions that we are dealing with here are therefore equally wide ranging.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In assisting the members of the House to understand the approach that I will take to this bill, I intend to go through a number of the items, particularly those on which we will concur with the government's views, and support the legislation. I will then identify several matters in relation to why we cannot support the proposals and flag that at the committee stage we will be opposing certain parts of the bill. There will be other matters that we will seek to have referred to a committee&mdash;in the Senate, these matters will be referred to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are matters which I think do raise important questions on the application of the Social Security Act in the context of some wider principles in relation to statutory interpretation and the way in which the government might proceed with particular initiatives that are contained in this legislation. I believe it is more important, when we are dealing with issues which are so discrete, that we deal with them as separate items of legislation rather than as an omnibus bill of this sort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first matter that I will address relates to the provisions dealing with the mobility allowance. The explanatory memorandum tells us that, from the day of royal assent, the qualification conditions for a mobility allowance will be extended to allow the mobility allowance to be paid to people with a disability who are unable to use public transport, are undertaking jobsearch activities and are under a competitive employment placement and training program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It becomes apparent that the very reason we are amending this bill in this context, for a benefit which will apply to some 400 people, is that it was largely administrative oversight that led to a situation in which, previously, these people had not been covered. It was clearly intended that they should be covered and that those who were embarking upon training programs to make themselves able to enter competitive employment ought to be covered. Those who were already in employment are so covered. It is quite clear that the mobility allowance was intended to apply. Obviously, we support this initiative&mdash;though it is not an initiative; it is a measure taken as a result of an oversight in that it was intended that these people should have been covered before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another amendment relates to the provisions dealing with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal stay orders. This will amend the way in which the Administrative Appeals Tribunal decisions are dealt with. It reverses a situation which arose where the AAT could order a stay of a decision under review where the Social Security Appeals Tribunal had already affirmed the department's decision. In a situation where a stay is operating, I assume that a person may continue to receive benefits or payments. In some circumstances, the purpose of an appeal could lead to a situation where moneys would continue to be paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment will create a new category of recoverable debt so that debts arising from where a person benefits from a stay that was not justified&mdash;the decision goes against them&mdash;are recoverable by the Crown. It seems to me that that is a proper approach to take where it is clear from the decision of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal that the benefit might not be being paid properly and that one ought not to continue to get the benefit of that by pursuing appeals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills looked at this matter and raised one point of concern, and that was that the way in which the bill was first drafted might have meant that the government could recover debts where an appeal was already under way and the stay had been granted and, therefore, it would have a retrospective effect. With the advice of the Senate committee, the government has come to the view&mdash;the opposition would have supported this advice&mdash;that it should not have a retrospective application. The government will be moving an amendment today. I am glad it is&mdash;it saves me doing so&mdash;and the opposition will support that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal act is to be amended to allow a widow B pension to be payable in circumstances where the person is already a beneficiary. The amendment is obviating the necessity of that person having to make a further proper claim in order to be eligible for the widow B pension. That already happens with the sole supporting parent payments. It seems obvious that those arrangements, which do not require the provision of any additional information but merely the lodgment of a form, should not deny anybody the entitlement from the date it might otherwise have been due simply because a person had failed to lodge a form which would not have provided any new information to the department. Obviously, the opposition will not oppose this amendment. On retirement villages, the explanatory memorandum states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Principal Act will be amended to clarify the existing retirement village definition. This amendment aims at preserving the original intention underlying the definition. It ensures that accommodation primarily intended for persons who are at an age which is more than 55 years is treated in the same way as accommodation primarily intended for persons who are at least 55 years of age, that is, as accommodation in a retirement village.</PARA>
<PARA>That sounds unduly complex, but again the amendment arises because something needed to be clarified. It is only a minor amendment, and we will not be opposing it. It demonstrates that the legislation which first dealt with this matter was deficient. We are now having to come back to make amendments to correct another oversight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can assure the parliamentary secretary that I will not run out of time; we have a committee stage yet. I take the opportunity to deal with the matter of confidentiality. The explanatory memorandum explains that we are extending the definition of `protected information', introducing a new offence relating to the deliberate use of protected information obtained innocently and rationalising related sections. There are some other minor consequential amendments as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without going into any detail in relation to this matter, let me simply say that the opposition will support the confidentiality provisions. They are a move in the right direction. However, it needs to be said that the Department of Social Security has not gone without a good deal of critical comment, particularly from the Auditor-General and the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption, which have identified the department as one place where information has been released for unauthorised purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the Independent Commission Against Corruption, information has been sold by some officers of the department; provided incorrectly to state and local government agencies through a legitimate arrangement known as a client confirmation service; and, in some cases, obtained by deception over the telephone. The Auditor-General made it very clear that there needs to be a strengthening of confidentiality measures. He found the need for a far more effective approach for clients who require enhanced protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General sees considerable risks in a department with some 23,000 staff having access to personal client details. Many of the staff have the capacity to obtain a print-out of those details. The Auditor-General raised a very interesting prospect of trailing the computer system so that the people accessing information can be later identified if it is found that information has been improperly disclosed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me, as it did to the Auditor-General, that audit trailing could provide evidence of unauthorised access to information and could be a powerful deterrent from unauthorised disclosure. He noted that audit trailing has not been reviewed since 1985 and that technological changes may now have made it economically feasible and technologically possible. Those are matters that need to be addressed by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage, we will be supporting this legislation. Although it is really only a token measure for dealing with the major problems identified by the Auditor-General and the Independent Commission Against Corruption, even tokens are welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has given very serious consideration to whether or not the measures dealing with the removal of the 15-day sitting requirement for ministerial determinations on public interest disclosures should be supported but, on balance, we will support the measure. However, I wish to highlight a potential problem which I have already raised in discussions with the parliamentary secretary's officers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The capacity for parliamentary review can be lost if there is a determination to disclose information in a particular case where the parliament considers it inappropriate. As the legislation currently operates, one would be in a position to disclose that information immediately the determination is made, even though at a later time, when disallowance can be looked at, the parliament may regard the disclosure as inappropriate. Essentially having taken this matter on trust, if the opposition finds that there has been some error of judgment in relation to it, we will come back to it at a later date. It is a trust given to ensure that the department acts responsibly and properly, but it needs to be acted upon with appropriate care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move on now to other matters of concern to me. The first relates to the value of assets used in primary production. The explanatory memorandum states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Principal Act will be amended to give effect to the original intention that where a liability exists in relation to an asset that is in any part exempt for the purposes of the assets test, then the apportionment rule will apply. This measure will commence on the day of Royal Assent.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a difficult issue&mdash;I have had some difficulty understanding it myself&mdash;but, put simply, this measure relates to a person who owns a property used for primary production but which may have on it a house not used for primary production. In calculating the value of assets used for primary production, the house is excluded and only the assets used for primary production are taken into account. However, when money is borrowed, it is borrowed on both the house and the assets used for the primary production because the bank says, in effect, `We want the money to be secured against all of the property'. So the financial institutions put those conditions on lending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government now wants to look at the debt and apportion some of it to the assets used for primary production and some to the house. Of course, that will increase the value of the assets used in primary production, thereby excluding some people from obtaining benefits&mdash;which is precisely the purpose of the provision. While I understand the government's intention&mdash;it argues that it was always its intention&mdash;it is rather interesting to note from the explanatory memorandum that the government sees this particular measure as being generous to people involved in primary industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that some of my colleagues in rural seats were surprised to hear that. Colleagues who have taken an interest in these matters find the notion of this being a generous test an extraordinary proposition. They see it as being a very onerous test, particularly in relation to the circumstances in which many farmers have found themselves&mdash;blighted by flood or drought. Some have had to seek assistance from social security and have found these tests very successful in making them ineligible for benefits because they suggest that they are asset rich, even though they may have next to no income as a result of drought or flood. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In that case, the parliamentary secretary may care to support our amendment because, unlike the government, we do not see the current tests as being particularly generous. In fact, we see them creating enormous hardship. In relation to the passage of these particular provisions, the government will not have our cooperation; they will be opposed by the opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the explanatory memorandum makes clear, the government has two other matters that it intends to deal with in the course of these amendments. The first is in relation to certain life interests created by wills. The government wants to treat them as an assessable asset. The explanatory memorandum states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From the day of Royal Assent, the Principal Act will be amended to provide that certain assets are not to be disregarded in calculating the value of a person's assets under the assets test on pensions and benefits. In particular, the value of certain life interests will not be disregarded in calculating the value of a person's assets.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments are intended to ensure that people cannot gain an advantage under the assets test by converting an absolute interest in property to a life interest only.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a second matter relating to investment income. The explanatory memorandum states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Principal Act currently allows the assessable period of a client to be taken into account when the client realises a `saved' non-superannuation investment.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Principal Act will be amended, from the day of Royal Assent to ensure that the assessable period of a non-client partner is also taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me just make the point&mdash;this will not come as a great surprise to the government&mdash;that these amendments will not have our support. It is not that they might not have our support in the context of a thorough review of assets and income testing. As I mentioned yesterday in the debate on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3), a review has been flagged, but the government seems to be going slow on it. While that is happening, there will be no cooperation from this side of the House on the passage of amendments that are designed to enhance, assist or in any way supplement or add to the assets and income testing regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our view is that the regime is deficient particularly in the context of managed investments and the unrealised capital gains test that is applied to shares. Until those matters have been thoroughly investigated and we have a thoroughgoing review of assets and income testing, the opposition will not be cooperating in further modification of legislation on these matters. In the few minutes that I need to deal with other matters I will not traverse that point any further. I will come back to it in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Life interests are the reason we will refer this matter to another place, to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I do not know the basis on which the department's practices are carried out. It may be that they were properly carried out in this matter. The advice in the explanatory memorandum is that the government has already been applying this test on assets even though it is not part of the law. I do not know on what basis that is happening. In my view, we cannot impose a test on people's assets if, at a later point, we come to the parliament and say, `We need now to validate this legislation to ensure that the test we are applying is a proper test'. It is a very serious matter if the department has been applying a test for which there is no proper legislative basis. That is a matter that needs to be more fully investigated and is a matter of very serious moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final matter I will address in the few moments that are left to me relates to the penalty interest charge. The explanatory memorandum states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The administrative charge currently applicable under the Principal Act in relation to certain debts will be abolished. The administrative charge will be replaced with a penalty interest charge that can be applied to any debt owed under the Act if (and only if) the person who owes the debt is not a current client and refuses to enter into an agreement to repay the debt or if, having entered into such an agreement, the person defaults on the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>The government hopes to make quite substantial savings from this measure. In fact, in the context of this bill, it is the one area in which there will be substantial savings which run to almost $2 1/2 million. It is a matter that requires further examination. I would not like to think that we are seeking additional revenue for the Commonwealth from this measure; I would like to think that it is a measure of proper administration in which the penalty interest charge will properly arise. The concern that we have&mdash;I too have this concern&mdash;is that, in relation to the way in which these interest charges will arise where people are given notice by the department, notice will be sent through the mail to their last known address. If there is no reply within a certain period, the penalty will start to occur. The penalty will be a penalty interest rate which the legislation prescribes of 20 per cent, or a lesser amount if prescribed. It will be 20 per cent under this legislation, unless at a later date it is prescribed that it will be a smaller figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The penalty interest will occur if a person has not entered into a contract with the department within those time limits. It may be impossible for some reason to enter into a mutually satisfactory agreement. It may be that a person is perfectly willing to make an offer to the department but that the department says that it was not satisfactory. It may well be that the person had moved innocently and nobody had referred the mail on, so he or she was never given any notice. Mail-outs with the Department of Social Security have been particularly flawed in recent months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs to look at these more detailed arrangements. There might be a way in which these arrangements can be looked at in order to develop a regime that is fairer on the department's clients. Under the proposals before us, it seems to me that the onus is being put very heavily on the department's clients, raising very significant debts, which in certain circumstances could be quite unconscionable. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The legislation before the House is of an omnibus nature and covers a range of issues. As the shadow minister for social security, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), has said, most of the amendments are relatively minor. He listed virtually all of the aspects they cover. It is surprising that, on the one hand, he was suggesting that they were areas of deficiency but, on the other hand, he failed to point out that a number of them had arisen because of interpretations by the court. The Federal Court, in one particular case regarding the definition of a retirement village and the 55 or 60 years of age minimum&mdash;this is quite surprising to me; my not being a lawyer, I suppose, would explain why I am surprised&mdash;said that an aged hostel, where the minimum age is 60, is not a retirement village because the requirement of the retirement village is that the minimum age must be 55. The fact that the age was exceeded disqualified it. I would have thought it would be the opposite. It took the court to interpret that and the Federal Court to say that that needed to be redefined. In other cases, it resulted from interpretations of acts and legislation by tribunals of one form or another.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is quite normal and it does go on. The idea that somehow the acts or the bills of this parliament are drafted perfectly and stay the same in interpretation forever and a day is obviously quite fallacious. As I said, the thrust of the shadow minister's comments were that somehow these were major deficiencies and incompetencies when they are quite simply interpretations by courts. It is quite possible that if a matter went back to a court again with a different judge there might be a different result. We are all used to that and know that that can happen. The response from the government is to clearly define and achieve what the legislation was originally intended to do and what the parliament originally sought. If the legislation fails to do so, then the onus is on the government to act as promptly as possible to correct that. Virtually all the amendments are of that nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer, with some humour, to the point the shadow minister made regarding the Italian and Australian social security update, which is what it is. He was attempting to make some quite unfair imputations on the people involved, which indicates the pedantic, petty nature of the opposition at this stage. Major agreements are being developed by the government&mdash;with Italy, Greece and other countries&mdash;to try to recognise that people do have entitlements in other countries. It took years to negotiate originally. Given the differences in legislation in different countries, they were enormously complex documents. In Italy people pay into a credit system&mdash;there is actually a contribution&mdash;whereas in Australia it is enough to be living in the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a need to normalise and standardise the different languages, taking into account the different systems, so that the terminology is compatible. Every time we change anything in our legislation we will have to revisit the agreements. The agreements are enormously important and enormously complex, but it is very important that they are done well because people who are affected by them deserve to be treated in the same way as any other welfare recipient. The shadow minister is virtually saying that, if a social security case comes up which affects a Western Australian, that person is treated differently from the person covered by the Italian government. We should not talk to the Italian government in the way we talk to the Western Australian government or community. The need to update these agreements on a continuing basis is enormously important. I am disappointed by the pettiness of the opposition in trying to demean that process and in trying to suggest that somehow that updating was improper. Incorporating those amendments into this bill is simply a normal housekeeping process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister took up quite strongly the question of changes in the area of confidentiality. He very clearly made the point that the changes were seen to be token, given the comments of the Independent Commission Against Corruption&mdash;ICAC&mdash;in New South Wales, and the comments of the Auditor-General. The fact is that these amendments redefine the responsibilities of departmental staff. When looking at information from social security, the ICAC inquiry identified the behaviour of individuals as a major issue. The shadow minister is saying that somehow we can legislate so that people will not break the law. That is absolutely foolish and stupid. It demeans the intent of this legislation. It also makes a fool of ICAC, because the ICAC report was not about making sure that every person employed in a Commonwealth department is totally honest and above corruption. ICAC was about making sure that we accurately define privacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I first came into this parliament not all that many years ago, the word `privacy' existed in the dictionary but not in legislation. The concept of privacy did not exist in Commonwealth departments, other than in the taxation department. As a member of parliament I could make inquiries of any department about almost any constituent. Information about people was not seen as being important to protect. This government has pioneered and grafted its way through enormously complex procedures and protocols and legislation to give people rights of protection of their information. It has taken us a long time. It is a continuing process because, as we make those changes, the community's understanding of privacy becomes more demanding and more sophisticated. This is just one more step in the process, with the department clarifying and better defining what is meant by privacy and departmental responsibility. It also applies to people other than the department, but in terms of social security information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, an officer should have a reasonable idea whether or not information is confidential. As the situation stands at the moment, before an officer is guilty of an offence we effectively have to be able to prove that the officer knew that information was confidential. That is what came forward from ICAC. It is the old Barwick bottom-of-the-harbour scheme. With the tax scheme it was a case of proving that the intent was in the person's mind, otherwise the commissioner would lose. That is what happened. It is a similar situation here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a sense, at the moment, the government has to prove that the officer knew that the information was confidential. That is how the current situation can be interpreted. This amendment changes that in a slight but very important way, so that it is now a case of whether it is reasonable to interpret that the officer would have expected it to be confidential. In the current context of training protocols that is relatively easy. But it is a very important legal shift. It is absolutely foolish to suggest that it is token. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect of privacy is to do with the protocols that go with the legislation&mdash;not simply the laws themselves but how they are applied and how the department is managed and how we as governments and as parliamentarians deal with our staff. If a person is going to be corrupt and dishonest and break the laws, it is a matter of how we find that out and how we deal with it. That is not covered. That is not part of the act. It is quite a separate issue which is more to do with the management of the department. If the shadow minister wishes to take that up, then he has done himself no justice in suggesting that these measures are both token and inappropriate in terms of the response to the question of ICAC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the matter of the incorporation of assets or how assets and liabilities are treated and the matter of life interest. These matters have arisen out of interpretations of legislation by other bodies, which puts the onus back on the government. We either redefine or more accurately define or we wear what is seen to be a wrong interpretation. For example, it would surprise many people to realise that it appears to be possible for somebody to will a life interest in a property in which they may have an intrinsic interest and therefore be exempted from application of the assets test. I think that many people would find that a fascinating way of dealing with assets. I suspect that it was no accident that that was done in that way. The incorporation of liabilities against assets, or the treatment of liabilities against assets, particularly for farmers, was very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The more generous treatment of the value of assets for farmers was also an important measure. Most farmers would have accepted that using exempt assets in the same way as non-exempt assets is a bit of double dipping or double-dealing. It is not all that straight. Most farmers that I know are honest and would rather be dealt with in the same way as anybody else. Farmers would not see it as appropriate that a slight loophole might be available to them but not to other people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same thing applies with life interest. The idea that somehow people design wills to leave their partner a life interest in what would likely be a mutual property, so that while that person is alive they are exempted from the assets test, is a bit of clever legalistic footwork. We have a tribunal interpretation of that; clearly, the onus is on the government to define it. If the opposition wants to go around the country and say that it is appropriate, it does smack of bottom-of-the-harbour. The spirit of the act is quite clear about assets. The shadow minister is saying that if a loophole can be found we should leave it open. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past 10 or 11 years I have watched the shift from this House to the other place. In almost every debate that I take part in these days with the shadow minister I hear him talking about the Senate committee, the Senate inquiry, the Senate constitutional committee, or the Senate bills committee. I wonder why he is down here. I thought he would have retired to the other place instead. It seems to be where most of his attention is focused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A comment was made earlier today that many of those opposite appear to have a preference for state parliament because they want to defer the rights of the federal parliament to the states. The shadow minister for social security seems to want to defer all his responsibilities to the other House. I find that passing strange. There is an absence of policy and an absence of clear directions, along with petty, pedantic nit-picking on what are really machinery, straight housekeeping amendments which bring the act back to where it was before some of these tribunals and courts found in the way they have found. Along with modifying the agreement with the Italian government, those are quite straight forward procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought that when Senator BB from next door came down here she would take the social security portfolio, because that is one area where there was a need for a new thrust in policy. The kind of pettifogging that is going on with these amendments does the shadow minister no good service; it does the House no good service. These are straightforward procedural matters that I thought would have enjoyed reasonable bipartisan support because they really do not change the underlying act, the intention of the act, or the spirit of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To suggest that the social security legislation wills assets away through life interest obviously denies the spirit of the legislation. To suggest that not taking into account all assets, exempt or otherwise, in terms of primary industry, is clearly not in the spirit of what was intended in the act. So to correct those anomalies is to obey the spirit of the act. I would have thought that these amendments would have been very straightforward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the opposition wants to go back and start the assets test debate all over again, then let us do that. Some years ago that was part of its federal election policies and the public very clearly said, `No, no way' and it was dropped like a hot potato&mdash;almost as fast as the GST; not quite as fast, but almost. If the opposition is going to put the assets test back on its agenda as an electoral issue, then it should do so. The opposition should not do it through this backdoor way of blocking off corrections to the act&mdash;interpretations of a legalistic nature&mdash;to satisfy the legal jungle and the loophole finders. If the opposition is going to do so, it should do so openly. It should come out in the open and say that it wants the assets test to be removed. It should not try to give assets test privileges to a certain few&mdash;those who can actually arrange their affairs accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments are very straightforward. It is logical to put forward, in this fashion, an omnibus amending bill.

As my colleague the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) said in his contribution, many of the items contained within this bill are not contentious and, therefore, will not be opposed by the coalition. Indeed, the coalition has a proud record on matters of social security and will readily support measures debated in this House which will be of some assistance to people in need. However, the coalition also has a record of objecting to those proposals which will have harmful consequences to those who find themselves on social security payments. It is unfortunate that this government has yet again brought before the House a bill which has such intentions and it will, therefore, come as no surprise that the coalition will be opposing these measures. </PARA>

Equally not surprising is that the most common complaint relates, at the moment, to the government's decision to reduce the family allowance threshold for payments from January 1 this year. The irony in this measure from the government is tragic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let this House remember that the first act of the Keating government in this, the International Year of the Family, was to stop family allowance payments to many Australian families. It did not waste any time in doing so either. On the very first day of the International Year of the Family, many families had this payment stopped. So it comes as no surprise that this fine gesture by this Keating government is the single most common cause of complaint from social security clients&mdash;many of whom are now ex-social security clients, having had their family payment stopped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, another great cause of concern amongst social security recipients in my electorate concerns the treatment of fringe benefits in regard to the payment of social security benefits&mdash;and I underline `benefits'. There is a degree of concern among many recipients of social security payments that the new regulations which take into account certain employer provided fringe benefits within the income test for family payments are unfair.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me first turn to sitting times. It is clear that the time has come to change the hours the House of Representatives sits. As we all know, and as the committee has confirmed, sitting late into the night, night after night, is not a productive or particularly sensible way to conduct our business. Except at the beginning of new sittings and on public holidays, from Monday, 21 February we shall sit Monday to Thursday each sitting week. So far as possible, we will stick to the two-on, two-off pattern; that is, two weeks on and two weeks off. In the other place, the Senate, senators will also be sitting four days a week. It will be convenient for the two houses to have similar patterns of sittings. Our normal starting and finishing times will be:</PARA>

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Questions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea of reforming question time goes back a long way. In an article on question time in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Journal of Public Administration</EMPHASIS> in 1972, a scholar by the name of John Howard&mdash;John H. Howard&mdash;concluded that `new procedures and parliamentary institutions must be implemented. It is no longer acceptable to rely on conventions and precedents that were established over 100 years ago'. The question time he describes sounds remarkably like the one we hear complaints about today. `The modern aim of Question Time', Mr Howard wrote, `appears to be not so much to seek information as to impart it, or establish debating points'. He quoted a senior politician, saying that question time `enlists information to secure a political advantage and to embarrass the Minister concerned'. `The first concern of a member of Parliament when he is in the House', Mr Howard said, `does not lie with the conduct of public administration. It lies with the survival of his party, whether it be in Government or Opposition'. All the same criticisms were there in 1972:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. fewer and fewer questions being asked</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. the practice of so-called dorothy dixers</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">. the intervention of broadcasting and press publicity which are alleged to have encouraged the diversion of question time into dorothy dixers and attempts to score by the opposition</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. the lack of tranquillity in the chamber</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">. the impossibility of enforcing standing orders&mdash;as the Liberal Party Speaker Sir William Aston said, `It is impossible to enforce all the Standing Orders at Question Time. I believe that if I did that, possibly we would have no Question Time at all.'</PARA>
<PARA>I know&mdash;as does the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard)&mdash;that this Mr Howard was describing it accurately, because I was there at the time. And, in fact, Mr Speaker, as you will see in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 18 April 1972, I spoke on the same subject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Question time has always been a great deal less than perfect. As John Uhr wrote in a monograph on the subject a decade ago&mdash;and I think these are particularly correct words:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"It would be wrong to look for some golden age of Australian parliamentary affairs when questions were asked and answered in an exemplary mode of non-partisan public service."</PARA>
<PARA>It has never been perfect; it has always been, to some degree, in need of reform. But the government of which the honourable member for Bennelong was a minister did not reform it. Although in those days much was written about question time, little came of any prospects for change. I am glad to say that this government will now take up that opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government accepts the committee's view that question time can be improved and that the time has come to try some new arrangements. The procedure committee recommended we should have a limited experiment with the rostering of ministers for question time. It proposed that ministers other than the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance should attend Monday question times on a roster based on half-hour segments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, however, has decided that, if change is needed, there is no point in tinkering at the margins. We have decided to institute a fully rostered question time on a trial basis for the remainder of this session. With other ministers, including the Treasurer (Mr Willis), I shall be available for question time on each Monday and Thursday to take questions ranging across the whole spectrum of government. Other ministers will be rostered to answer questions relating to their portfolios and those of the Senate ministers they represent. The Leader of the House will be drawing up the roster and will consult the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Howard) in the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Question time will be at 3.00 p.m. and will last for 45 minutes, as recommended by the committee, with the government nominating a minimum of 14 questions. It should also be remembered that, because on that schedule the House will be sitting at least one extra day in each two-week sittings, there will be an additional 45-minute opportunity for questioning the government. This will mean that more homework will be needed on both sides of the House. Some members of the opposition's long front bench will have to think up some questions on their shadow portfolio responsibilities, probably for the first time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the other Mr Howard said in 1972, `The advantage of the Westminster system is that it makes the questioner have some degree of responsibility as well as the minister who has to provide an answer'. In such a system as I propose, this would probably be more than true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those, like the honourable member for Bennelong, who complain about question time being used for political purposes at the very least ought to have the honesty to admit that the questions are as political as the answers. I am sure that the honourable member for Bennelong does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, our parliamentary system is based on the Westminster system of government. In my view, it is superior to any other. But, as I have said, this does not mean it should forever close itself off from reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality of the way in which our national politics are conducted is vastly different from that which existed when the current arrangements for question time and sitting patterns were instituted decades ago. The advent of television and other new technology, as well as the many points of accountability outside this place, means that more emphasis is now placed on opportunities, appearances and form as much as substance; more often than not it is on the theatrics rather than the seeking and provision of information. </PARA>

Of course, this is nonsense, and a quick perusal of the record of question time bears this out. For instance, last year more questions were asked of me by the government than by the opposition. The Leader of the Opposition asked, on average, one question of me per sitting week.

But did the government of Malcolm Fraser unchoke it? No fear. Malcolm Fraser did not change a thing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contemporary record also shows that vast areas of government responsibility go largely unscrutinised by the opposition. More questions are asked of a broader range of ministers by the government than by the opposition. In 1992, 70 per cent of all opposition questions came from the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party. Seventy per cent of all questions in that year were asked of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer&mdash;of me and the then honourable member for Fremantle. So much for claims of opportunity for scrutiny of other ministers or questions going to opposition backbenchers, or even frontbenchers. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is entirely consistent with our Westminster parliamentary tradition, with its emphasis on collective responsibility, that we should encourage questioning not only of the leading ministers but of all ministers; and not only questions from the opposition leaders and government backbenchers but questions from all backbenchers, including opposition backbenchers. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mark my words, Mr Speaker: no man in the history of this parliament has done more to downgrade, abuse, sabotage, undermine, subvert and threaten the process and procedures of this parliament than the current Prime Minister. His speech has absolutely nothing to do with improving the operation of this parliament. It is all about an accommodation of his arrogant and imperial lifestyle. It has nothing to do with improving the parliament but is about bending the system to suit his own particular ends. It is a massive indulgence. It is emperor Keating in full flight. It is just another attempt by the Prime Minister to work the system to his own advantage at the expense of everybody else involved in the democratic process&mdash;most importantly, the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Never has so fundamental a change been hidden behind such a flimsy veil as in that ridiculous speech just delivered by the Prime Minister. The centrepiece of the remarks by the Prime Minister was the significance of question time. Now, I acknowledge that question time is very important. It is unquestionably the focus of the parliament&mdash;as it should be because it is the one forum in which the government can be held to account for its actions, its policy and its performance. Question time is absolutely fundamental to our democratic process. In fact, question time should be democracy in action. Question time is where the government should be held accountable day by day and where ministers should be subject to scrutiny day by day. In short, question time is the very foundation of our whole democratic system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet this Prime Minister is intent on destroying the essentials of our parliamentary system by further downgrading the significance of question time to suit his own ends. We only need look at the way he has behaved in question time in recent years. He walks out of question time when he is under pressure. When the going gets too tough, somebody pulls the back of his coat and out he goes. He cannot hack the pressure. He has often boasted in the past that question time is an opportunity for robust and vigorous exchanges, but all he has done is turn question time into a session of crude and crass abuse. </PARA>

He has not once set out to answer any of our questions. He has not once set out to take matters seriously&mdash;and his behaviour is not restricted to question time. We have gone through periods where he has denied us the opportunity to debate matters of public importance and to censure the government for bad performance. The Prime Minister did not even attend when I gave my response to the latest budget speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a consistent pattern in his attempt to undermine the very significance of this parliament. The Prime Minister has total contempt for the committee system of this parliament. He stops ministers from appearing before parliamentary committees. He is not interested at all in accountability to them because, as he says, he is not prepared to `slum it' in front of a parliamentary committee.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But way beyond all of that, throughout his parliamentary career, the Prime Minister has attacked our constitution, he has attacked our flag, and he has attacked and rewritten our history. This is the man who today came into this parliament and had the gall to invoke the Westminster system. He had the gall to talk about reform of the parliamentary processes. The veil is a very thin one because it is clear that all of this is about twisting the system to accommodate the Prime Minister and reducing the amount of scrutiny to which he and his ministers are subjected on a daily basis in this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look at the justifications that have been given in recent days for some of these changes. The Prime Minister was very careful in his remarks today not to explain to any significant extent why the changes were made. But those opposite have been actively briefing the press gallery as to why the changes should be made along the lines that the Prime Minister has proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most interesting things that I have seen in recent days in the press was a justification for these changes, in particular the fact that the Prime Minister will only come to question time twice a week. The justification is that he wants to mix it more with the people of Australia. Can honourable members just imagine this man mixing it with average Australians? This is the man who criticised his predecessor for wasting his time tripping over television cables in supermarkets. He now wants to go out and discover the people of Australia&mdash;the people who were lied and cheated to at the last election. He suddenly wants to go out and discover them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can just imagine him going out to one of those Bankstown pubs and sitting down and talking to the people about the vagaries of Thai teak tables. They would be interested in that. They might run home and see if they have any argon lamps like the ones he has in the dining room at the Lodge. The Prime Minister could probably share with them his understanding of how to get a $200,000 extension on a carport. I am sure they would be delighted to hear about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He might even explain to a small businessman how he can get a loan out of the Commonwealth Bank for a piggery venture that has some obviously doubtful characteristics. He could explain to them how one can pay twice the market rate for Gould bird prints for the cabinet room. People will be interested in that&mdash;not to mention their interest in unemployment, not to mention the fact that in some cases their kids may not have got into university or that their aged parents may not be able to get hospital treatment. People would be delighted to be able to have the opportunity to mix it&mdash;or should I say mix it up&mdash;with the Prime Minister on a daily basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other justification the government has been using is that it is picking the eyes out of the best of the Westminster system and the procedures of the British House of Commons and bringing them over to Australia. The government is trying to pick up the idea of rotating the Prime Minister's appearance in the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very interesting to make a comparison between the Australian parliament and the British parliament. The fundamental difference is that the Speaker of the British Parliament would be independent. I will not believe that the Prime Minister is fundamentally interested in the reform of this place until he comes in here and proposes an independent Speaker. He would get a very favourable response from our side if he proposes an independent Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the number of days the British Prime Minister answered questions in 1992. In 1992 this parliament sat for 60 days. What a disgrace! The people of Australia cannot understand that we sit for so few days. We sat for 60 days in 1992 and for 47 days in 1993. By comparison, the British parliament sat for 143 days. So the British Prime Minister, even going in for half the time in the British parliament, had about 62 more days of question time than our Prime Minister did. Yet our Prime Minister is now proposing to reduce the amount of time he spends in the parliament by half. So he would be in here for question time for only 30 days a year. I have heard talk of a 35-hour week, but a 30-day year is a joke for anybody, particularly the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is running from the scrutiny that he knows is inherent in the essence of this parliament. He is twisting the system to match his own imperial lifestyle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the few minutes remaining, let us look at a couple of the other changes that are proposed by the Prime Minister in this very thin and very undetailed report on parliamentary performance and parliamentary standards. I would like to say something about the ministerial roster system. I bet that the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly can hardly wait for the ministerial roster system. It means that, when we get her under pressure on one day, we are not allowed to pursue her the next day. We are not going to be able to ask her questions the second day, we have to wait until she is rostered back on. Does that not make a mockery of ministerial scrutiny and accountability?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here is somebody who has taken $30 million of taxpayers' money and allocated it in a blatantly political way, with the possibility of fraud, without being able to account to the Auditor-General for the way those decisions were made. What an amazing woman that minister really is! What a memory! A total of 2,800 separate applications were reviewed by her and 726 grants were made by her and, apparently, she keeps all the details in her head. She is an amazing person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point about this change is that we will not be able to pursue that minister. All this change will do is hide a minister like Minister Kelly from the scrutiny she should have in this parliament. It makes an absolute mockery of the system. The argument is that more ministers will have the opportunity to be asked questions. Some cracks were made about our side in making that point. The Prime Minister knows that has never been the case; he knows that that is not so. I can remember asking questions of Minister Tickner and Minister Walker at the time of Mabo. Who stood up and answered them? The Prime Minister did. I have seen him answering a question for Minister Kelly. I have seen him answer questions for other ministers as well. That is a fiction. The only thing the Prime Minister is admitting to us is that, on the days he is not here, he will not have to sit there and squirm as these ministers come up and try to answer these questions at the box. Their incompetence is phenomenal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister should look at the incompetence of his ministers over the last nine months. There was not only Dawkins, whom he got rid of after a bad budget, there were also Collins and Beddall and the pay TV debacle. What incompetence! Collins signed off under the law and said, `I didn't know that I had that responsibility. I didn't know what I was signing'. What about Senator Chris Schacht? The fact is that he has divided the science community in Australia and made us the laughing stock of the international and Australian scientific communities. What about Rosemary Crowley and the accreditation of child-care centres?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Good point. There are other examples of ministerial incompetence right here&mdash;Minister Tickner and Minister Walker in the handling of the Mabo debate. The Prime Minister did not let them anywhere near some of the detail of that debate. He has a whole string of incompetent ministers. The only conclusion I can draw is that he is not prepared to sit here and watch them self-destruct under the cross-examination that will undoubtedly come.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The greatest focus on this rostering of ministers is still going to come back to the Prime Minister and the fact that he is prepared to come in here for only two days a week to face questions from the other side. Given that there has not been a significant increase in the number of questions, this is making a mockery of any sense of accountability by the Prime Minister to this parliament and to the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, I could not agree more with the editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> this week, which said that the proposal for the Prime Minister to be rostered on two days per week spits in the face of a sovereign parliament and people. That is precisely what he is doing. He is spitting in the face of a sovereign parliament and the people of Australia in not being prepared to face the scrutiny of this House for four days a week. If we sat four days a week, we would have a 60-day year. It is just ludicrous to imagine that the Prime Minister is so prepared to debase our democratic structure that he is not even prepared to stay. He is institutionalising the fact that he wants to come in here on only a limited basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have said on an earlier occasion that we were interested in parliamentary reform. I thought I heard the Prime Minister say on an earlier occasion in this House that he was genuinely interested in parliamentary reform. It is about time he started to listen to what the people of Australia are saying about parliamentary reform. Let us look at some of the letters to the editor in recent days about the performance of this parliament and the extent to which the people of Australia have downgraded even further their image and their understanding of what we are about.

<PARA>The Prime Minister can laugh. He stood here, as he delivered his speech today, and laughed about the changes. He laughed and joked with his backbench about the way he was undermining the parliament to what he believes to be their benefit. He made a big joke of it. He laughed just then at those two average people in Australia who had taken the trouble to write a letter to the editor because they were concerned. He thinks the whole thing is a joke. He treats the people of Australia with contempt. He treats the whole parliamentary process with contempt. These changes that he has proposed today are nothing more than self-indulgence at the expense of the interests of this parliament, its place in our society and the interests of the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Australia will not be fooled because, as a result of these changes, they will not see any better government, they will not see any greater accountability and they will not see any greater scrutiny.

If we go back over the years, we see that he has made a sustained and deliberate attempt to undermine parliamentary standards to his own benefit.

I do not expect anybody to stay and listen to this speech. I pardon honourable members from the chamber; they may leave with my permission. Members of the Labor Party have already gone. They did not even enjoy the real movement we had today of the leaders of both parties speaking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must confess, before I start my speech again, that I am one of those who believe in reform of this chamber and I welcome the idea of earlier nights. I say that after being here since 1966. The rest is for debate, but we certainly cannot get away from the early sitting times. I just wanted that put on record because I will not get an opportunity to speak in the debate when it comes forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before my speech was interrupted, I was talking about the confidentiality of information in the possession of the Department of Social Security and the care that needs to be taken to protect that confidentiality. I am therefore pleased to see that this legislation makes some attempt to improve the privacy provisions within the act. However, I note with some concern that, whilst the bill widens the scope of the privacy regulations, the penalty for an offence under the act is to remain the same&mdash;two years imprisonment, or a fine or term of imprisonment as determined by a court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of the seriousness of this matter, I take this opportunity to inquire of the minister whether this particular item of legislation has been examined. If it has not, it should be, for I believe that, while it is all very well to be improving the regulations as they relate to privacy, we should also be examining the penalties as they relate to the abuse of privacy regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not traverse the ground covered by the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) regarding the privacy aspects of this bill, especially as they relate to the coalition's efforts in setting up the Senate inquiry into privacy. However, I want to place on record my support for measures which will enhance the privacy of clients of the Department of Social Security and any other government department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other aspects of this omnibus bill will not receive any support from the coalition. Indeed, as I foreshadowed in my opening remarks, the coalition will continue to oppose those measures announced by this government that it regards as iniquitous. For example, the clauses in this bill which provide for life interests being counted as assets and for the apportionment rule to apply to certain primary producing assets are iniquitous. However, what is even more disturbing about these measures is that they pre-empt the findings of the income and assets test review which the government has been forced into by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, it is not my intention to traverse old territory but the simple fact remains that this government has shown a total lack of concern for the well-being of pensioners who have investments in either shares or managed investments. These pensioners appear to be fair game for the Keating government. As if the measures enacted last year regarding these investments were not enough, this government has embarked on measures to further reduce the living standards of older Australians&mdash;and I am close to being one myself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is simply no excuse for this. It is now some three months since the government announced the review of the assets and incomes test and we still do not know the name of the consultant or tribunal that will conduct the inquiry. What we do know is that, due to the government's stalling, there will hardly be sufficient time to conduct a proper review of this most serious matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, the government has no understanding of the degree of concern many pensioners have regarding the conduct of this review. I am sure that, if there were to be an inquiry into ministerial salaries, the Minister for Social Security would be anxious to know the outcome because it would concern his own standard of living. Why then does the minister continue to delay this important inquiry when the standard of living of many pensioners throughout Australia so clearly depends on the findings of this review regarding the assets and income test? I sincerely believe the government does not understand the magnitude of concern that exists among pensioners about these issues. It is therefore very disappointing to see legislation such as this brought before the House, pre-empting the findings of the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally disturbing are the investment income provisions within the bill. It is my understanding that the bill will actually legalise the common practice that the Department of Social Security has been adopting in this area for some time. One has to be very suspicious of the legality of such behaviour. If, as appears to be the case, the department has been adopting this policy without the necessary legislative basis, we must seriously question the legality of the practices of the department. I would be greatly interested to learn from the minister the exact procedure adopted by the department in this regard. Pensioners deserve better. They deserve a better deal than the one they are presently receiving from this government, and they deserve better treatment than the provisions in this bill provide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect of this bill which concerns me relates to the penalty charges which are to be imposed as a replacement for the administrative charge. This bill will abolish the current administrative charge and replace it with a penalty interest charge in circumstances where a person owes money to the Department of Social Security and that person is not currently in receipt of any money from the department. I note that under proposed section 1229B the penalty interest charge is to be set at 20 per cent per annum or at a lower rate which may be determined by the minister under section 2. I suspect that this arbitrary 20 per cent rate is too high in certain circumstances. Given the complexities inherent within the Social Security Act and the changing nature of people's circumstances in relation to eligibility to claim social security benefits, I believe that this penalty is too severe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consider the case of a person who has inadvertently misled the Department of Social Security simply because he or she has not fully understood a form that had to be completed. In such a situation, and according to the act, that person might find himself or herself liable to the penalty for illegally claiming social security benefits. This bill proposes that if, after a 14-day period, the person does not enter into an agreement with the department for repayment of that money, the 20 per cent penalty charge is to apply, assuming the person is no longer a client of the department. I believe there is some danger attached to this and it is quite foreseeable that the plight of an ordinary person who has made an honest mistake may be compounded unduly by this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had similar protests from constituents of mine who have had problems with the Taxation Office. It would seem the tax office is even more draconian in its dealings with people. The tax office imposes a flat rate 25 per cent penalty on the amount of tax which has been deemed by the tax office to have been avoided. It does not matter whether there was any intent to understate the tax liability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, the new policy for social security means that the tax office will impose this flat rate regardless of whether people have made an honest mistake or have deliberately set out to defraud the Commonwealth. I would suspect that, for the most part, both the Department of Social Security and the tax office deal with people on average incomes where the amount of the discrepancy would be relatively minor. To impose an arbitrary charge on these amounts of money, regardless of the intent or lack thereof of the person in question, could cause considerable difficulties for the person concerned. I would, therefore, ask the minister, in the light of the new policy of the tax office, to consider this measure of the penalty charge carefully. Perhaps a little discretion in dealing with matters of debts owed to the Commonwealth would be more helpful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not propose to take up any more time of the House in relation to this bill. I reiterate my concern for pensioners and for the, dare I say, shabby way they have been treated by this government. This bill does nothing to help the plight of those pensioners and it even makes several amendments to further reduce the standard of living of some pensioners. I suspect that we will again be dividing on this issue and it will come as no surprise to see government members voting in this chamber to reduce the living standard of pensioners. That has been the practice of this government for some time now and it is no wonder that the only voice for the aged community in this place comes from the coalition. I thank the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for his offer for me to speak for a further 20 minutes but I decline. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that respect, of course, the government's commitment contrasts greatly with the attitude of the opposition. We have heard some pretty interesting comments already today from the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), in his usual effort to criticise the government on social security matters, and also from the honourable member for Cook. I will turn immediately to his comment criticising this government for its changes to family payments&mdash;changes which came in on New Year's Day in the International Year of the Family. He condemned us for reducing the upper limit for family allowance from $64,000 to $60,000 a year. He seems to have forgotten that under Fightback the opposition was going to slash the upper limit to $55,000. So much for the opposition's concern about family allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the subject of pensioners, whom the honourable member for Cook seems to be so concerned about and whom the opposition alleges are so hard done by, the pension as a percentage of average weekly earnings in February 1983, before this government was elected, was 22.7 per cent and under this government it is now 25.2 per cent. So much for the opposition and its criticism of the government's track record in relation to pensioners and social security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it is this Labor government that is always reforming and always seeking to review the effects of legislation and the operations of government programs and departments in order to make people's quality of life better. We are the ones that are introducing new programs, coming up with new ideas and new social reforms. In contrast the opposition, of course, has no policies, has a do-nothing program and has nothing to offer the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal-Country Party coalition was in office for 23 years, from 1949 to 1972, and did absolutely nothing. They were the Rip Van Winkle years of Menzies and his successors, who, of course, had nothing to offer the Australian people. It is interesting that when Gough Whitlam was elected Prime Minister we suddenly had some significant amendments to social security. I remember that period quite well because in those days I was a fairly junior employee in the Perth office of the Department of Social Security. I can remember the plethora of reform and legislation that came into the Department of Social Security because, after 23 years of neglecting the ordinary Australians who were social security beneficiaries, we suddenly had some amendments and reforms which caused quite a lot of changes&mdash;changes which were long overdue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the introduction of the single parent benefit, which was then called the supporting mothers benefit. Before that, there was no benefit of that nature for single parents. Some members of the opposition do not believe in single parents; they do not believe that single parents should exist. Recently the Acting Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Anderson) made some derogatory comments about children of single parents as opposed to children in other families. I think that is fairly typical of the attitude of those opposite towards single-parent families and towards people on social security. So let us not have this hypocrisy from the other side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, an even greater example of that hypocrisy is in Fightback&mdash;I have already briefly mentioned Fightback&mdash;under which we would have had a $10 billion cut in public sector expenditure, including $2 billion from the social security budget; and $3 an hour wages for youth trainees and $3.50 an hour for other people. It was an absolutely outrageous platform and it was, of course, rejected by the Australian people. So let us not have this nonsense coming from the other side attacking the government over social security. </PARA>

The only analysis that I can come up with is that it is only the government that cares about people; the opposition does not believe in social security, in income support&mdash;it believes in charity. If it had its way we would probably have a Thatcherite system&mdash;a system in which people have to hold out their hands, in which the rich give charity to the poor&mdash;rather than a system in which beneficiaries, the less fortunate in society, can receive with dignity income support from a system which is constantly monitored and reviewed in light of social justice, as this government monitors and reviews our social security system.</PARA></TALK.START>

But I am not going to deal in histrionics about who was right and who was wrong with their policies in that election in March 1993 because I think that the people of Australia will realise by the time we get to March 1996 who was right, who was telling the truth and who was not telling the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will cover some of the measures that have been outlined in this piece of legislation. The opposition will not oppose the proposed change to the mobility allowance. It is a measure that I personally believe is important. The mobility allowance is payable to disabled persons engaged in gainful employment, undertaking training under various programs or engaged in approved charitable work and who are unable to use public transport without substantial assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current rate of the allowance is $51.50 per fortnight. Clause 4 will amend section 1035 of the Social Security Act 1991, which is the principal act, to make disabled persons who cannot use public transport without substantial assistance and who are undertaking jobsearch activities under the competitive employment placement and training program eligible for the mobility allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This begs a further question as far as the criteria that are applied to job seekers in regional and rural areas of Australia are concerned. They have to go along and approach so many employers per fortnight for so many months and then they have to provide documentary evidence that they have done that. In some areas that places an onerous responsibility on people on jobsearch and newstart allowances. I do not know whether the department, the government or the minister has looked at this area but quite a number of constituents in my area have certainly expressed concerns about their ability to meet those requirements and in some circumstances the draconian way that the department has without notice cut off their benefits. We seem to be addressing one area, with this mobility allowance being extended towards disabled persons who are actually seeking a job under the jobsearch allowance, but I think that we should be extending it and looking at different criteria for accountability as far as a lot of the recipients of jobsearch and newstart allowances are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of this amendment bill relates to changes to the AAT stay orders. We support the general direction of this amendment in trying to simplify the stay orders with the appeals process of the Department of Social Security, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. We agree that it is anomalous that two Department of Social Security clients in a similar situation may be treated differently by the law depending on whether the SSAT or the DSS happen to be in agreement or in dispute&mdash;which is crazy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, we are getting away from the human aspect of what we are trying to do with this social security legislation. We are trying to help people who are disadvantaged, people who are in a less fortunate situation than ourselves. We need to get away from the situation that we see so often in our electorates: these people are disadvantaged because of rigid policy guidelines and the way they are enforced by some officers in those departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a retrospective element in the debt recovery section of this amendment. The department has given an assurance that the amendment was not intended to result in retrospective application. Steps will be taken to ensure that this will not occur. Why not take steps now and make an amendment to clarify what has happened? Surely that would be the simplest thing to do, rather than have the possibility of coming back to this House in the future with a further amendment. Therefore, we will not oppose this section of the bill, but we will support the coalition's attempt to move an amendment preventing retrospective application of the stay order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next element of the bill relates to the widow B pension. We propose to support the government amendment to this section. On the mid-north coast of New South Wales&mdash;where my electorate is&mdash;there has been a big problem with what happens when a partner dies. This amendment attempts to address that problem and now places widows in line with sole-parent pensioners. There appears to be no reason why persons who qualify for the widow B pension should be treated differently from sole parent pensioners in similar circumstances. Therefore, we propose to support this aspect of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not oppose changes with respect to the confidentiality amendment. As I understand it, the coalition has been at the forefront of criticising the lack of legislation protecting the confidentiality of client information. The coalition was instrumental in the establishment of the 1991 Senate inquiry in this area and has publicised weaknesses in the department's confidentiality measures. I have some personal concern over the introduction of criminal charges against a person who knowingly releases information. The explanatory memorandum states that this extension might apply:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">if a person happens to find Departmental papers in the street or at the tip (because of defective destruction or cleaning arrangements or because of a fire in Departmental premises); or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">if information is incorrectly released by the Department (eg, because of an incorrectly addressed fax message).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Should the person finding the information know that it is protected information and intentionally record, disclose or otherwise use it, he or she will be committing an offence.</PARA>
<PARA>Surely, the onus should be on the department to destroy records properly and not to send incorrect faxes. If a mistake is made, it should not be covered up by laying criminal charges against innocent individuals. If anything, it is important that the individual does release the information so that departmental accountability is maintained and the public is aware that the department has not destroyed some information properly. The amount of information that these government departments have on every single Australian is absolutely mind-boggling. It is terribly important that this confidentiality aspect is reinforced. This goes part way towards doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next element of the bill relates to the value of assets used in primary production. As has been set out by the shadow minister, we propose to vigorously oppose this element of the bill. The government is trying to amend the legislation so that, where a liability exists in relation to an asset that is in any part exempt for the purposes of the assets test, the apportionment rule should apply. The apportionment rule in this case is that, where a primary production asset whose value is partly exempt for the purpose of the assets test, only that part of the liability relating to the non-exempt asset will be allowed as a deduction. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition policy is to review the assets test in relation to rural property owners. Therefore, we oppose this aspect of the legislation. It is fair to say that rural property owners are in a fairly grey area with regard to the department and assets and income testing. But in these hard times this section of the community should be given all the support it can, instead of the department shutting them off from services. Again, the government is showing a lack of understanding of the difficulties that are faced in rural and regional Australia. Mr Deputy Speaker Newell, coming from the area that you represent, you should understand this quite clearly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This section of the community faces totally different problems than those faced by most other sections of the community. Therefore, the rural community should be given special attention and consideration for the circumstances which it faces from time to time. If this government is serious about trying to nurture, cultivate and help the rural sector of our community grow and maintain that productive base from which this country has become so wealthy in past generations, it should seriously consider the impact of this aspect of this legislation. I urge the government to have another look at this. As I said, the opposition will be opposing this element of the bill.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next element of the bill relates to certain life interests created by wills being an assessable asset. Again, the opposition will be opposing this element of the bill. With the review of the incomes and assets test for pensions imminent&mdash;I say imminent because the government has been dragging its feet on this issue since before Christmas&mdash;it is not timely for legislation of this nature to be introduced until the findings of the review have been released. We should really wait until that happens. The government would be responsible to wait for that review to take place, unless the minister knows something that we do not know&mdash;that the review, or the appointment of the consultant to conduct that review, will take longer than we all originally expected when it was promised before Christmas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment will provide that certain assets are not to be disregarded in calculating the value of a person's assets under the assets test on pensions and benefits&mdash;further scheming by the government with regard to the elderly community. That is a very serious point. A person who has a life interest will not derive any benefit other than the current day income from that benefit, which will become part of the income test anyway. But we are talking about the assets test. That person will never gain any benefit from that life interest other than the income that would ordinarily be considered in the income test aspect of the assets and incomes test. Personally, I believe that it is unfair to introduce this amendment to the bill. We strongly oppose this aspect of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The elderly have already been given harsh treatment with regard to the most ridiculous legislation that I have seen in my short time in parliament, one element of which is the treatment of any unrealised capital gains on shares and managed investments as income. I have spoken three or four times on this particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of the inquiries made of my electorate office relate to this aspect of the social security legislation and the way this government has treated a lot of the people that it coerced into voting for it in March 1993. Labor used a scare campaign of half-truths and untruths relating to what was going to happen to pensions, how it was going to cost more to live under the GST and how people were not going to be looked after as well under Medicare. Yet, immediately on its return to power, this government has attacked them by considering their unrealised capital gains on shares and managed investments as income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are thousands of cases in my electorate of people being affected; people who have been honest in their dealings with government throughout their lives and who were honest in their dealings with the government when they retired. They paid their taxes and were honest when they declared what investments they had. They went along to the Department of Social Security and said, `This is what we've got. What level of pension will we get?'. The Department of Social Security assessed what level of pension they were going to be paid and that was subsequently paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then the government decided to shift the goalposts and there are people who would now have to be considered to be on the breadline and who are absolutely poverty-stricken because of the measures that have been taken. The minister still has not implemented the measures that were promised for conducting a review of assets and income testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a constituent who recently moved to Port Macquarie from Sydney. He moved to Port Macquarie and bought a unit there to live in. At the time, he still owned a property in Sydney. So he had his principal place of residence and another asset&mdash;a property in Sydney. He went along and made all of the necessary declarations to the Department of Social Security. The department wrote to him and said, `This is the pension you are going to be getting'. It was reassessed at the end of last year and Mr Frank Baker was informed that, as of 23 September 1993, his pension was to be increased from $110.90 to $152.30 per fortnight. That was fine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He had declared that he had household contents and personal effects at $3,000 and accounts and cash at $210,000. This was based on the fact that he had sold the property in Sydney. The money was sitting in the bank. He had $210,000 sitting in the bank, a $4,000 motor vehicle and, at the time, $18,000 worth of managed investments&mdash;a total combined asset of $236,542 which entitled him to a pension of $152.30 per fortnight. That is okay. Honourable members should remember that he had $210,000 in the bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He then decided that, as a citizen of Australia, that money was not helping the growth of this country; it was not being used to the benefit of Australia. So he invested it in a managed investment portfolio. He did not invest it all; he invested about $190,000 of it because he bought a car. On 13 January 1994, the department wrote to Mr Baker setting out that his yearly income consisted of bank interest of $960 and, because he had $196,000 invested, income from the managed investment was assessed at $52,526&mdash;a phenomenal return in anybody's language considering where inflation and interest rates are today. This gave him a total income of $53,486 in the eyes of the Department of Social Security. He did not have an income of $53,000 to go and pay for his petrol or to buy his bread and his milk. He did not have an income of $53,000 to buy some meat or pay the rates. That was his assessed income from the income and assets test as far as his pension was concerned. On 13 January he received a letter from the Department of Social Security which stated:</PARA>

Mr Baker is going to sell his units in managed investments and put the proceeds back into the bank, where it is not going to earn any interest, so that he will get his pension again.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a close look at some of the things that those opposite are about in social security and compare them with what we are about. Payments for children of low income families have increased in real terms in the past 10 years by 74 per cent for children under 13 and by 147 per cent for teenagers. That is Labor. That is our policy. That is what we have done. Payments to sole parents with between one and four children have increased by around 22 per cent in real terms and when increases to rent assistance are taken into account they have increased by about 30 per cent. These are not just spurious claims; these are facts. Those opposite do not like it. The people of Australia have seen through those opposite; they have seen what their policies are about. The basic pension rate has increased in real terms by 14 per cent under Labor. Rent assistance has increased by between 81 per cent and 141 per cent, depending on the target group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The alternative under those opposite was that people were supposedly going to be compensated for the GST. Because there was a $6 billion hole in the calculations of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), the opposition's compensation package directed to social security benefits would have been around $2.6 billion. But the consumption tax policies of the Leader of the Opposition would have cut around $2.4 billion off welfare spending. That means that nearly all the compensation given to social security recipients would have been paid for by taking away benefits from other social security recipients. And the honourable member for Lyne has the gall to ask us to remember the election. He has the gall to put his record against ours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition was going to introduce very tough income testing arrangements for the family allowance, including an upper limit of $55,000 for a family with one child. This income test would take the family allowance away from more than 100,000 Australian families&mdash;not individuals, but families. About 90 per cent of families with children are presently eligible for the family allowance. Under the opposition's proposals, only 75 per cent would get the family allowance. Many of these families who lose are not well-off, especially given the costs of raising children. Many two-income families would also lose, even though they have to bear increasing costs of child care or caring for an elderly family member. What provisions did the opposition put forward for that? There was silence from the opposition because there were none. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sole parents were also looked after by us. After the way that the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) denigrated families with one parent, he will be very lucky if a lot of people who are sole parents, through no fault of their own, do not wreak havoc on him. Fancy denigrating people because they do not have either a father or a mother. It is absolutely outrageous. Then he says, `Oh, I am not denigrating you, except that all the statistics show that you are bigger criminals and that your propensity to have a good and happy life is down the tube'. If that is not denigrating people I do not know what is. Robert Hudson, the Executive Director of the Victorian Council of Social Service, criticised the opposition's policies and described the consequences as `horrendous'. In a press release dated 21 November 1991, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sole parents affected will be forced into looking for full time work. This will mean that children in this age group will be left alone without a parent before and after school and for at least twelve weeks during school holiday periods . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for McPherson had the hide to say that members opposite were all about parents being with children. What absolute and total hypocrisy. Mr Robert Hudson further stated:</PARA>

<PARA>This is the Year of the Family&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>Pensioners would have been rorted under the opposition's system of GST; their spending power would have been decimated. The opposition has the gall to suggest that it stands up for them. On the question of disability support, the opposition was planning to make people undergo an annual review in order to maintain their level of benefit. In relation to this, Senator Graham Richardson&mdash;not one of the opposition's biggest fans&mdash;stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A 70% impairment level will very often involve paraplegia. One wonders how we are going to wheel paraplegics in to have annual medical reviews. I find it extraordinary that anyone would even suggest that a saving would be involved, that suddenly the condition would get better and the lame would walk. I only wish they could.</PARA>
<PARA>On the question of targeting the unemployed, I am glad that I have time to quote Professor Dick Weatherby of Washington University, an expert in social security and a visiting fellow at the Australian National University. Professor Weatherby warns against further tightening eligibility for welfare payments such as the unemployment benefit. That is exactly what the opposition was going to do with its nine months off the dole scheme. Professor Weatherby said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the US, for instance, only one-third of the unemployed can qualify for unemployment benefits, so two-thirds don't get anything at all. You're talking about a lot of desperate, hopeless people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The kind of policies about cutting the dole and limiting it to nine months, cutbacks (in other welfare payments) and talk about decentralising to voluntary agencies, that's in the mould of some of the more regressive US policies and it has left us with a legacy of social division and very serious social problems.</PARA>
<PARA>We know what the serious social problems are. American cities are in a state of war. They have tanks on the streets busting doors down to get at drug dens. That is the sort of Australia that the opposition was advocating. Before those opposite start rubbishing this government on its record, they should be honest about what that record is. Before they start standing on high moral ground, they should remind themselves exactly what they were standing for on 13 March 1993. They should remind themselves of what Australia would be like today if they had got their way. I would suggest to those opposite that they have nothing to be proud of and that we have everything to be proud of. This country is in a much better state.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mobility allowance is now to be extended to people with a disability which impedes their use of public transport. This allowance is paid in relation to their involvement in the Jobsearch program. This is an excellent move. The disabled are very upset when society assumes that because a person has disability X that they are therefore useless. In fact, the existence of a disability very often promotes a fierce determination on the part of a person to succeed and to rise above the disability. This determination is vital for their psychological wellbeing. Parliament should give the helping hand to these people who are so determined to help themselves.We still have a long way to go in this field of integrating the disabled into the work force, but I think that all members of parliament should encourage the disabled in every electorate to put in the effort to rejoin the work force. Work by itself is a psychological necessity for every human being, including the disabled. </PARA>

Last week, I spoke of the need for government departments to have administrative flexibility. No set of regulations can possibly encompass the full range of problems and situations that human beings can present. The need for a decisive human involvement is vital. If we reject that view the government may as well have computers decide social security decisions on the basis of straightforward applications and endless regulations. As we do not do this and we do involve people, we have to be sensible and allow these people a certain latitude to use their sensitivity and educated intelligence in solving social security problems. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The needs for confidentiality are well accepted these days and one point that I would bring to the attention of the department is this: all members of parliament have dealings with the Department of Social Security on behalf of their constituents. It would be useful if the department could examine its situation vis-a-vis the privacy of its clients with regard to members of parliament and their staff as authorised agents for the constituents whose problems the members or staff bring before the department. I have encountered difficulties in dealing with the department because it is bound by confidentiality. I have no problem with the general principle, but the particular problem for members of parliament and their staff is one that should be dealt with when next the department looks at this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Labor Party came to office in 1983 the government has attempted to target, even more precisely, the usefulness of the social security dollar. Administration costs have been contained and the front desk processes have been greatly improved. The economic difficulties of the 1980s have had a profound effect on Australian society and we owe a great deal to the succession of very competent ministers for social security, including very much the current Minister for Social Security, my electoral neighbour, the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Baldwin). A key consideration in keeping the Department of Social Security operating properly in the difficult 1980s has been the principle of targeting the social security dollar to where it is actually needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point, I would like to give credit on this matter to the opposition coalition. Generally, the level of cooperation by opposition members in social security matters has been very high. To their credit, they avoided taking the road of cheap populism and instigating an undisciplined approach to social security. Whatever difficulties the coalition has encountered in politics since 1983, it is certainly true that all its leadership over those 11 years, including the current one, have actually tried to be responsible and genuinely concerned for those involved, as clients, with the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government and opposition have, naturally, seen some solutions in different lights. Yet I believe that the opposition has always acted genuinely and out of a real concern for fellow Australians. In this light I support this bill, which prevents some unscrupulous persons from so reorganising their property to present a false image to the department and thus secure benefits to which they are not entitled.</PARA>

The implementation of the agreement needs to be done with a maximum of discretion and sensible flexibility. The department should act on the basis that no agreement can possibly cover all human situations. Flexibility and circumspection need to be emphasised when the rules of the agreement are invoked. I am not asking for a special favour; I am asking that the department develop a positive attitude to solving the unavoidable problems that will arise in connection with this agreement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, he was not speaking to my script; he wrote it all himself. This bill has been called an omnibus bill, but in many respects it is a housekeeping bill. The Social Security Act is a very important and in many ways comprehensive act. I guess that when governments spend the sort of money that we spend on social welfare&mdash;something like $30 billion&mdash;they have to be careful that they get it right. We have to be careful that the payments are properly targeted and that only those people who deserve and need the payments get them. We cannot have it both ways.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that, as usual, my friend the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), the shadow minister for social security, said that this was just another case of our having to fix up legislation that had not been done well in the first place. When dealing with such a comprehensive bill, we will never always get it 100 per cent right. One of the major reasons why we are taking some of the steps included in this bill is that various decisions have made some of the intentions of some of the sections of the bill a bit chancy. All we want to do is make sure that the intention is well known so that in future tribunals will  understand the position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the fact that the opposition will support most aspects of this bill. I will not go through the purposes of it because I think they have been canvassed fairly well. However, I will touch on a number of matters which were mentioned by the honourable member for Berowra. He mentioned the international agreement with Italy. I know that he did not in any way try to denigrate it&mdash;I accept that&mdash;but he did make reference to the fact that a number of officials had visited Italy and that there had been some expense in the renegotiation of this agreement. I had a fair bit to do with the renegotiation during the time that I was the parliamentary secretary to the previous Minister for Social Security, the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett). I went to Rome to start the renegotiation proceedings. The document was signed in October, or perhaps even later last year, by the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The renegotiation of that agreement was a result of the many representations that we received from the many thousands of Italian-Australians who live in this country and are in receipt of pensions from Italy. Without mentioning any figures, I can say that the amount that this country receives by way of foreign exchange from Italy is quite substantial, and that the amount of expense that was incurred in renegotiating this very important agreement was negligible in that context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The patronati are organisations funded by the Italian government that help Italians in this country. Mr Speaker, I am sure that, with the many people of Italian origin in your electorate, you know exactly what I am talking about. I know that the honourable member for Berowra does as well. Those people lobbied us long and hard to try to fix this agreement, and we did that. I wanted to mention that because it is probably one of the best parts of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Berowra quite correctly says that the confidentiality provisions are a sensitive area. In the past, unfortunately and regrettably, there have been some breaches in this area. There is no doubt about that. This provision is just another provision trying to ensure that, where possible, we stop these incidences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The winners from this measure are departmental clients and the general public, who are being further protected from the improper use of information. It is purely a positive measure that will close a loophole that previously allowed certain non-information, such as that a person is not a client of the department or that a client has no partner known to the department, to be recorded, disclosed, solicited or offered for use without an offence being committed. Such behaviour is an unsustainable invasion of privacy. Making it an offence cannot be criticised. I understand that both the Attorney-General's Department and the Privacy Commissioner supported the proposal. I can understand the point made by the honourable member for Berowra, but he can be assured that we are always looking at the question of privacy. When cases of the privacy provisions being violated in any way are brought to our attention, he can rest assured&mdash;and this parliament can be certain&mdash;that we will come down very heavily on the people responsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mention was also made of another provision in this bill with respect to the value of assets used for the purposes of ascertaining liabilities used in primary production. The honourable member for Berowra was concerned about this matter. He said that this was only a revenue raising measure. In fact, according to the information that I have received, the proposal has negligible financial impact. We do not expect to be making any money out of this. We are trying to make sure that it is fair so that certain people on large properties are not able to deduct amounts that obviously have nothing to do with their private residences and the curtilage around them, and that when we value those assets we do so on a fair basis. We are not about allowing deductions for business purposes in so far as they relate to obtaining some sort of pension or benefit from the Department of Social Security. We are very generous in our interpretations of this. In my many and varied travels throughout this country during my four years as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security I have very often appeared on radio programs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am. I often encourage farmers, in particular, and property owners to test their eligibility in the event that they are entitled to any sort of benefit from the Department of Social Security. In fact, in many instances I go so far as to say that farmers who are doing it very tough, and have done it very tough in the past because of droughts and other reasons, should not feel any loss of dignity in approaching the department for help. After all, they are entitled to it. A lot of them, unfortunately, have overinflated ideas of the value of their properties. They do not realise that they can own their own homes and take off liabilities that they might have before their assets are decided. In many instances, they could well have been entitled&mdash;and in many instances could still be entitled&mdash;to the additional family payment.</PARA></TALK.START>

They might be quite surprised to find that, in these days of falling values and very low values in the country&mdash;which hopefully will improve in the future&mdash;their property is not worth as much on the open market as they may have thought. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue that was brought up by the honourable member for Berowra was the question of the pensions income and assets test review. I want to say a few things about that because it is important. I understand that the honourable member has made it very clear that the opposition will not agree to any legislation that impacts in any way on the pensions income side of the equation.

A strategy is in place to encourage and facilitate submissions from as many interested parties as possible. The honourable member for Berowra has been advised that the consultant will not be precluded from examining any aspect of the current operation of the income and assets test. These very broad terms of reference mean that taking care of the process at this stage will pay dividends when the review enters its consultative phase later this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister for social security also claims that pensioners with shares and managed investments will continue to be adversely affected. Only two per cent of pensioners are affected by the new rules on shares.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 22 December 1993, the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) issued a press release whereby he made very clear what was about to take place.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think this is the best opportunity to raise a general matter relating to the social security legislation. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) has just commented that he does not expect there to be any further amendments during this session. That is a matter which causes me some alarm. Amendments to the social security legislation were dealt with in December and related to the arrangements for payment of a mature age allowance. I understand that amendments to the legislation, which were accepted in this place, were designed to ensure that a person who took up temporary employment for a short period of up to 13 weeks, and who then experienced unemployment again, would be able to go back on to the mature age allowance without necessarily having to satisfy a qualifying period of 12 months on the jobsearch benefit, which is a condition precedent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of a view that has been formed as to the adequacy of the drafting, which the parliament presumably has been involved in, I gather that the intention of the amendment, which was clear and accepted, may not have been fully met and that the department now has a view that it cannot allow recipients of the mature age allowance to have short periods in the work force and then go back on the mature age allowance without a qualifying period. That is a matter of some concern to me. I have had it confirmed that that difficulty has arisen. Obviously, it would require some further amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we are discussing the application and commencement of the legislation and amendments in clauses 1 and 2, I thought that this would be the most appropriate place to raise that matter. I would just like to have the parliamentary secretary's assurance that his view that there will be no further amendments required this session will not preclude the basis for remedying that defect being found. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been made aware of that particular problem. When I said that I did not expect there to be further legislation, I did not make it carte blanche. We will not continually be introducing bills and we should try to do everything we can on this bill. My understanding is that the amendment, which I think we accepted, as drafted by the Australian Democrats, did not have the effect that it was supposed to have. We are obviously quite concerned about it. We are looking at ways and means of making sure that somewhere along the line we fix that up. Whether it be in the context of this bill in the Senate or in a subsequent bill not too far down the track is something which I will have to leave in abeyance for the time being.

<PARA>I have tabled the explanatory memorandum for the previous amendments. The amendments in part 7 of the bill are extremely complex and difficult to interpret. Amendment No. 3 will ensure the same policy outcome using a simpler legislative approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 1121 of the Social Security Act allows the value of an individual asset to be reduced by the value of any liability secured against that asset for the purpose of the assets test. It also provides for a situation when a liability is secured over a mixed asset. A mixed asset is one that comprises both assessable and exempt components; for example, land being farmed versus the home and curtilage. Importantly, if the liability is related to a mixed asset, then that part of the liability that relates to the exempt asset is calculated and ignored so that it cannot reduce the value of assessable assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 1121A was inserted in 1991 as a beneficial measure for farmers. It allows primary producers to aggregate their assets and liabilities relating to primary production. For example, if a farmer has a harvester worth $80,000 but the liability secured over it is $100,000, then under section 1121 its value would be nil. However, under section 1121A the $20,000 deficit can be offset against the value of other primary production assets. As is the case with section 1121, an intention of section 1121A was that, if primary production liabilities are related to primary production assets that are mixed assets, then that part of the primary production liabilities relating to exempt assets would be calculated and ignored so that they cannot reduce the value of assessable assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a recent Social Security Appeals Tribunal case, section 1121A was interpreted as not achieving that intention. This interpretation would give farmers unintended advantage. It would mean that the value of assessable primary production assets would be reduced by the value of liabilities associated with exempt assets. Also, this would be inconsistent with the way liabilities related to non-primary production assets are treated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment No. 3 gives effect to that original intention, as did the amendments currently in the bill, in a relatively simple way. Amendment No. 3 achieves the intention primarily by expanding the method statement in subsection 1121A(2). The method statement sets out how to work out the value of a farmer's assessable primary production assets for assets testing purposes. The expanded method statement makes it clear that both exempt primary production assets&mdash;for example, farm, home and curtilage&mdash;and related liabilities will not be included in the value of assessable primary production assets. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understand it, we are seeking, firstly, to address the question of whether clauses 27, 28 and 29, as first proposed, should stand or be omitted. The government will be seeking to have those clauses omitted and it will have our support. The government will then seek to substitute a new clause 27, the question being that the part proposed to be substituted be substituted, and it will face our opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make clear what we are dealing with. The government seeks to give effect to its intention in relation to assets used for primary production purposes. The government wishes to substitute an amendment designed to give effect to what it says was its original intention; that is, where any part of a liability existing in relation to an asset used for primary production is exempt, against which moneys have been borrowed, an apportionment rule should apply to both the asset and the liability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am satisfied with what the government says is its stated intention, that the new clause is simpler and perhaps better achieves the government's purpose than the clauses that were originally drafted. We would not want to hamper the government in any way in proposing the best possible draft to achieve its intention. Our view is that the intention does not deserve support. We think the imposition of the assets test generally on primary productive properties is harsh. I know that does not correspond with the government's view. The government sees its asset test as being generous. I read something to that effect on page 31 of the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) say again tonight that, when he goes on the air and speaks to people about primary producing properties, he will tell them that they are being looked after. I am not sure that all those people who would be stripped of the opportunity of obtaining a benefit in situations such as drought, pestilence, fire and flood, particularly when they have no income, would regard it as particularly generous to be told, `We're terribly sorry; your assets are of such a value that you're not able to obtain a benefit. You ought to realise on those assets or come to some other arrangement to borrow against them in that situation of hardship'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our view has always been that the assets test proposed by the government is harsh and, to that extent, unconscionable. It is our view that it is by no means generous. We did not regard the government's original stated intention as being generous. We do not regard the variation that the government is proposing now as being generous. For that reason, we will oppose it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not alone in our view. The National Farmers Federation does not agree with the government's amendment. It thinks the department has taken a somewhat arbitrary approach on this matter. It believes that the apportionment rules fail the test of equality and practicability. I made this point this afternoon when I was addressing the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) during the second reading debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arbitrary nature of this arises when we consider that the test as to what we include when we are borrowing money as security is imposed by the lending institution. I imagine that there are situations in which primary producers are not seeking to have their home, which is separate from the primary producing property, included in the security. But the parliamentary secretary knows the nature of financial institutions; they are not prepared to let any security go. They want to include it all for the purposes of securing their liabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, apportioning the debt in that way, rather than treating it as a debt raised in relation to the primary income producing asset, is a fair and proper way to deal with it. The government has told us what its intention was, but obviously the government's tribunal did not understand its intention. It came to another view about the way in which these provisions, as drafted, should be interpreted, and it gave effect to that view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier in the day the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) likened these particular provisions to tax avoidance arrangements&mdash;bottom of the harbour arrangements&mdash;and suggested that the farming community was involved in some scheme to undermine the fabric of the social security regime. I reject that view in its entirety. This is a situation wherein primary producers are entitled to look at the law and to apply it, as it has been drafted, to their particular circumstances. One should not be drawing inferences about their conduct because the law has been drafted in a particular way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is prepared to allow the law to remain as it has been interpreted by the government tribunals that deal with these matters. The opposition is prepared to oppose the amendments, both those that were originally put forward and those that were substituted, because it sees the status quo as being a small advance on the present situation. It is the opposition's position that the government's assets test regime, in any of its amended forms, is not the appropriate one to apply to assets involved in earning primary production income. For that reason the opposition will be opposing this particular measure. </PARA>

It may be that this provision provides relief for perhaps one or two dozen people. Maybe, compared with the figures we normally think of, the amounts are not large. But, as far as I am concerned, if it applies to one or two dozen, then it is valid and the point I have made is valid. It has to apply to only one person for it to be valid. If the parliamentary secretary is right in saying that the amendment has no effect, then, for heavens sake, I would not bother pressing for it and I would not waste the time of the parliament with it.

Whilst the government is appropriately acting to ensure that those who have assets utilise them for the benefit of their retirement, there are limits to a nominal shareholding in the Commonwealth Bank being deemed as 50 per cent income.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The provisions we are now dealing with are in part 8 and part 9 of the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3). They relate to assets and income testing. Part 8 deals with life interests created by a person's deceased partner, which are to be included as an assessable asset. Part 9 deals with modification of the assessable period in relation to investment income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I make it clear that, in relation to each of these matters, the opposition will not agree to any further amendments to social security legislation or veterans affairs legislation which seek to amend, enhance, develop or modify in any way whatsoever the income and assets testing regime until the independent inquiry&mdash;commissioned, I might say, by this government under duress&mdash;has been undertaken, completed and its report presented to parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All honourable members would be aware that the government made its announcement in relation to this matter last year. The terms of reference were settled. It was to take the heat off the government in relation to the unconscionable provisions relating to shares and the treatment of unrealised capital gains on shares as income for the purpose of income testing. It was also arranged to take the heat off the government in relation to the large numbers of people who were receiving modifications to their pension as a result of the provisions dealing with the treatment of managed investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government wanted the pensioner community to believe that it was embarking upon a genuine inquiry designed to address all of these matters. Earlier in this debate, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) told us that no matter was beyond the purview of this inquiry. So it was very clear that the matters that could be looked at would include not just assets testing and income testing generally, but also these very specific issues which have hurt many people in the community in ways which I find quite unbelievable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had thousands of complaints. My colleagues have had large numbers of complaints. We are all aware of pensioners with very modest investments&mdash;very often set aside in order to pay for their funerals, to have the house painted, to carry out some minor plumbing repairs or whatever&mdash;which have come back to haunt them and have led to their receiving very substantial reductions in their income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently the government has been lauding the huge increases in share prices as a result of the increase in the all ordinaries index. The government has been saying, `Isn't this great for Australia?'. But I can tell honourable members that if they were pensioners who had some money in shares acquired since August 1992, or if they had a modest amount of money invested in a managed investment where some of those investments might well be shares, when these adjustments were taking place they would have been looking at a downward adjustment of their pensions. People have been left with amounts as small as $90 a fortnight on which to live where previously they were receiving the full pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a situation that needs to be addressed quickly. Instead, we find the government foreshadowing an inquiry to be undertaken by a consultant that it is yet to engage. The consultant is to be assisted by a reference group. The parliamentary secretary tonight introduced us to the reference group. In it were people whom I suggested to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin). I have no problem with the fact that there is a reference group. Some of the people involved are admirably equipped to undertake the task. The government has sought to get a group of people with a wide range of backgrounds representing a wide range of organisations. However, we still do not know who will be undertaking the task of conducting the inquiry. I certainly do not know who it is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The parliamentary secretary says, `In due course'. This is the inquiry that is to report tentatively by July and be in a position to give a final report by September this year. It is now February, and a report is to be expected by halfway through the year. I do not believe that any consultant should be expected to reasonably undertake this task in that time frame without enormous difficulty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is stalling in this matter. The parliamentary secretary disputed that. He said, `It is far from stalling. We are open to having all these matters reviewed. Only two per cent of pensioners are affected. So one ought not to be worried about the delays'. That is what he is really telling us. Only two per cent of the people are affected, so do not be worried about the delays. The fact is that there is a large number of people&mdash;I think running into hundreds of thousands&mdash;who are affected by the provisions relating to managed investments. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I did not pluck that out of the air. I have had the briefings from the department in which we were identifying the numbers of people&mdash;the winners and losers&mdash;in relation to these provisions. The figure of hundreds of thousands is a genuine and proper figure. In relation to shares, I admit that the figure was first something of the order of 100,000 or so&mdash;I think it was 120,000. After the government made its modifications it reduced the figure to a mere 10,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we are talking about those sorts of numbers we are talking about hundreds in every electorate around Australia. We are talking about the hundreds of people who have been writing to my colleagues and the thousands of people who have been writing to me on this matter. I am surprised by the honourable members opposite who seem to be able to take this matter in their stride and who do not seem to be worried about the fact that an inquiry can be announced, but they do not know where. All they know is that the department that advised the government in relation to introducing these provisions, and the department that has administered these provisions, now has the job of collecting the submissions that people are invited to make. This task is being undertaken, in effect, by the very department whose arrangements are to be the subject of the review. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us know the name of the consultant and where that consultant can be written to for the purposes of sending submissions. Mark my words: I have a mailing list of thousands of people to whom I will send those details when the inquiry has been formally put on foot. But at this stage there is no inquiry; at this stage there is no consultant. We will not agree to amendments that are designed to enhance assets testing, modify assets testing, enhance income testing and modify income testing until this process has been completed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Chairman. I would love to know from the honourable member for Berowra which of the ones on that list he does not agree with. Looking at that list, I see that there is substantial collective expertise amongst those people. They are drawn from pensioner groups, the Association of Independent Retirees, the Financial Planning Association and life and superannuation organisations. I cannot think of anyone else that we could have properly put on. All I ask of the honourable member for Berowra and the opposition is for them to be a little more patient on this matter. I can assure them that it will not be long before a consultant will be appointed and, in due course, in the not too distant future, announced by the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin).</PARA></TALK.START>

Indeed, if he wants to send the thousands of submissions which he says he has, he can send them to the department now. I will guarantee that they go to the consultant. He need not worry about it. He does not even have to wait for us to name the consultant. He can arrange to send those submissions to us. He can send them to me, if he wants to, and I will make sure that they are referred on.

The most recent proposal contained in the majority report of the Advisory Committee on the Proposed Creation of a Department of Parliamentary Information and Reporting Services intends to merge the current Department of the Parliamentary Library and the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff into a new department called the Department of Parliamentary Library and Reporting Services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, the explanatory memorandum claims, as does your second reading speech, that there will be no financial impact as the new department's appropriation will be the same as the total of the previous appropriations to the departments to be abolished. It goes further than that. In the discussion and in the report it is claimed that there will be savings of about $1 million over the period of a full parliament. This was, among other elements of the initial report, contested by the minority&mdash;which consisted of Senator Baden Teague, Senator Margaret Reid and then Senator Karen Sowada of the Democrats&mdash;in its report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dissenting report gave six reasons for rejecting the majority report's views and opposed any amalgamation of the two departments. Briefly, the reasons for opposition were that the independence of the Parliamentary Library would be compromised; the proposal was opposed by senior parliamentary officers, particularly the Clerk of the Senate and the Deputy Parliamentary Librarian; any possible savings were not guaranteed, although I note that the Department of Finance has made some commitments in that regard; previous proposals to amalgamate parliamentary departments were strongly opposed by senators, and for that reason were not proceeded with; the proposal is ultimately about control and does not give sufficient importance to efficiency or service to members and senators; and, finally, the conduct of the inquiry was regarded as unsatisfactory in that the advisory committee was not appointed by the parliament but by the Presiding Officers and, consequently, its proceedings were not open to the public, nor was evidence taken in the normal manner. These reasons stand and they are, basically, the reasons why the opposition has decided not to support this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most important consideration is the question of the independence of the Parliamentary Library. The view put forward by my colleagues in the Senate is that the proposal will compromise the independence of the library and prevent the library from fulfilling its objectives and responsibilities to the parliament. This is certainly a view which the majority of senators appear to have consistently held on every other attempt that has been made to change the structure of the parliamentary departments over recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority report devotes a considerable amount of its findings and recommendations to an attempt to answer this concern regarding the independence and integrity of the Parliamentary Library service and address the substantial expressions of concern which the committee obviously received. Notwithstanding those attempts to answer the concerns, the majority report, in the view of the minority report, still fails to ensure a solution. The recommended amendments to the proposal and additional safeguards suggested in the majority report were not seen as providing a solution to the fundamental compromise inherent in the amendment. Consequently, the only adequate solution which is put forward is to retain the Parliamentary Library as currently constituted&mdash;in other words, as one of the five separate departments of the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much emphasis was placed in the report on overall efficiency. It was made quite clear, for example, in the identification of services. Page 3 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Identifying those services and functions will involve a significant coordination task in reaching an agreed strategic vision. The implementation of that strategic vision will require technical agreement and co-operation to determine deliverables and then, in conjunction with the Presiding Officers, Senators and Members and the Chamber departments, setting priorities as to the order in which services should be provided.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the point which the minority report makes, and which is certainly supported by the opposition, is that even if the effort were made to incorporate the two departments, there would be really no guarantee that the necessary degree of coordination would follow. Similarly, it is put forward that more adequate coordination could also be achieved without necessarily having to change the fundamental structure of the departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was particularly intrigued to note one observation in the report to the effect that it is necessary to have a totally separate administrative machine for every department. It is my understanding&mdash;and I stand to be corrected if I am wrong&mdash;that there are a number of cases where departments have been established in the past where the administrative services were provided by a different department. There is the whole issue as to whether or not administrative savings can be achieved by the combination of, effectively, two administrative units into one without having to change the fundamental structure as it currently stands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also pointed out that there are savings to be made. That is an interesting observation because the report does not really guarantee those savings. In recent days I have had reason to make some observations about the fact that the Parliamentary Library is about to have a significant facelift. Essentially, the facelift will involve changes to the lobby of the library which will cost in excess of $500,000. So, half a million dollars&mdash;about the basic saving anticipated from these proposals&mdash;will be gobbled up almost immediately because we are to have a remodelled entrance to the library. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is claimed that this remodelling was recommended by the Auditor-General. It is true that the Auditor-General  conducted a project audit on aspects of the Parliamentary Library. Recommendation No. 21 of his audit report No. 6 of 1991-92 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO recommends that as part of the structural review the Department of the Parliamentary Library consider&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I draw the attention of the House to the word `consider'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the following additional measures to enhance client orientation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He mentions the introduction of a common inquiry point. At the end of that paragraph, he states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This recommendation was suggested to the ANAO by the DPL reflecting work currently underway within the Department to improve the ease of use by clients and the efficient use of staff resources.</PARA>
<PARA>It is abundantly clear to anyone who sees the entrance to the  library that the expenditure of $500,000 at this stage on that particular proposal is very hard to justify. The point has been made by various sources, including in a response to a question which I put on notice, that the Parliamentary Library Committee was reported to have supported these changes. I draw further attention to the fact that the Parliamentary Library Committee does not have any executive power; it merely has the power to advise. It is true that the committee noted in its minutes at meetings in May 1992, August 1992, September 1993 and, recently, on 15 December 1993 that this proposal was going forward, but it has never had the authority to actually influence the final events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has also been claimed that this proposal flows from the recommendations of the Auditor-General. As I have just pointed out, I think the Auditor-General was really drawing attention to the recommendation which had been given to him in the process of his efficiency audit by sections within the library. It is quite clear that the library as a whole is somewhat divided on this subject. In these straitened times, one would have to seriously ask whether half a million dollars could not be spent more effectively than in the way proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to hold up the House unduly on this matter, but it is a sensitive issue and one which essentially has to be determined by both houses of parliament and by all members in it. The services of the five parliamentary departments, particularly the library, probably have more bearing on the capacity of members to carry out their responsibilities than any other service, apart from that provided by the management of the two chambers. Consequently, if there is a significant degree of concern in the parliament about these proposals&mdash;regrettably, that appears to be the case&mdash;I strongly suggest that they not be proceeded with, as was the decision taken on the other occasions when reforms of this nature were put forward. Consequently, the opposition has decided not to support this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, if my memory serves me correctly, it was one of your predecessors, Joan Child, and the then Deputy Speaker, the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), who first mooted these reforms. Discussion continued under the reign of the honourable member for Watson as Speaker. I want to say that I very much share with the honourable member for Watson his keen interest in and concern for the function and form of the parliament, as well as his belief in its need to be reformed and updated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an era in management where we are getting flatter organisations and more accountable executives with greater responsibilities, I am absolutely staggered that a Liberal Party spokesman is arguing that this parliament, in its new environs, needs five permanent heads to report to the Presiding Officers. I have never heard anything run counter to modern management practice more than that which was uttered from the lips of the honourable member for Bradfield. In fact, I am shocked and surprised that he should be advocating such a thing at all. It would be absurd if we could not amalgamate two of the departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of those two departments, the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, has under its purview the Hansard Division&mdash;which deals with the actual transcribing of speeches&mdash;the Parliamentary Information Systems Office, and the Sound and Vision Office. Those services are all within one department&mdash;an administrative reform again prompted by the honourable member for Watson. I do not know why that department cannot amalgamate with the Parliamentary Library. All these sections deal with either information systems or computer systems. I do not know why they cannot come under the umbrella of one department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, if there is a criticism to be made it is that I think you have gone overboard in trying to protect the right of the chief librarian and the Chief Hansard Reporter to go to you directly, thereby bypassing the statutory office-holder. I also note that you have provided the opportunity to have a library report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, while everyone in this House would share the view that the library must be free and independent and able to provide worthwhile advice to members of parliament, that does not obviate the necessity for good management and the provision of client services on time and in the manner and form that members of parliament require. I can report that members of my staff have had some very good service from the library but, frankly, my experience of it has been more than disappointing. To give a recent example, because of my interest in the child support scheme I was desperate for what I thought would be independent, impartial advice about a certain matter relating to that scheme. I was advised that I would be contacted by the head of a particular research unit in the library. I am still waiting for the call. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I am grateful for the library and admire it, and I would be the first to defend its independence, I do not want us to go around believing that there is nothing new under the sun, and that nothing can be changed or made more efficient. We live in an era where every dollar has to give us more bang. The days of being able just to front-end load services are over. When I look at the industrial landscape of Australia and see the changes that have been made towards flatter, more responsible organisations, and fewer departments, I cannot understand the opposition arguing that this parliament, in its new environs, needs to be exempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every member of parliament would dearly love to have a position on their staff to allow a person to be trained or be able to hire an additional research officer. Frankly, governments of the day&mdash;whether Labor or Liberal&mdash;I suspect are always going to be coy about it. Members of parliament and their staff have got to provide more services with the same amount of resources and we will have to ensure that we take advantage of every technological innovation that will improve our productivity and extend our reach to our constituents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ought to be proud of some aspects of our parliamentary democracy with its distinctive features. I can well remember that when I wanted to see my local federal member or local state member I had to go into the Commonwealth Centre in Phillips Street or to Macquarie Street. Electorate offices were not known then. There was a revolution of change which established local offices in each electorate. Then there was the saga of increasing the staff. But those staff increases have been in response to increasing needs of constituents. So the more facilities we have and the more productive we are, the better we are able to respond to our constituents. When we put party politics aside, that is the essence of being a member of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this new department there is the wherewithal for that extra productivity. When I first came into this House computers were unheard of.

We have gone a long way from the time when we were given a computer in Parliament House but were not going to get one in our electorate office. I remember that I had an Apple IIE computer at home. I brought it into the electorate office and stitched it up with an appropriate interface to the electric typewriter. I thought how brilliant I was being able to churn out 300 letters in about three days. Now we can produce letters at the rate of eight a minute and we are looking at being provided with better quality printers which print about 12 or 16 a minute.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All members of parliament have now been given the opportunity to have a mobile phone. I predict that over the next few years honourable members will require laptops and will want to be able to interact both with Parliament House computer based systems and their electorate offices from wherever they are in Australia, provided the mobile phone has the reach. That is again going to increase our strike-power and our accessibility and will probably put even more demands upon members of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I am trying to make is that, whilst some institutions have served us well in the past with their current structures, from time to time we have to move forward. This is a logical move forward and it is consistent with what is done in outside enterprises and other institutions. The opposition is saying that the integrity of the library is under threat, notwithstanding the safeguards built into the legislation. Those opposite are saying that we cannot have micro-economic reform in Parliament House. They are also saying that we cannot reduce the number of departments; for integrity's sake we must have five departments reporting to the Presiding Officers. I find that incredible. I find it beyond belief that the opposition is adopting that view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am frankly surprised by the stance taken by the opposition with regard to the changes to the standing orders. I thought those changes were at least worth a trial. At best, it would substantially and radically reform the way the parliament operates, but, more importantly, change the way it is perceived to operate by the public. I do not know how the honourable member for Bradfield expects me to say to my constituents in Chifley, `You might have been retrenched; the work force might have been reduced at your place of employment; you might have seen some top level managers moved out and amalgamations effected, but Parliament House is different. We have to preserve the library. We cannot have these sorts of modern changes and management practices interfering with the processes of parliament. You out there live by a different standard and you cannot expect us to live by the same standard'. I think that is absolutely ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, I noticed in your second reading speech that you indicated that there are going to be some savings which you hope will benefit members and senators. I strongly support that measure. It concerns me that we do not have an unequivocal undertaking from the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) that those savings can be directly applied. I hope that the often stated and many times demonstrated concerns that the Minister for Finance, as Leader of the House, has for the operations of the House may overtake any reservations he may have as Minister for Finance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a good principle that ought to be drawn to the minister's attention. Where organisations try to overcome years of ossification in the interests of more effective and efficient services, and there are consequent savings as a result of these changes, those proceeds should be spent; there should be some rewards in the system and an opportunity to redirect those savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, I assure you that I strongly support the legislation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members are becoming more and more aware of the opportunity that technological change provides for them in enhancing the services that they and their staff provide to constituents.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, I should say up-front that I have a particular interest in this legislation, having been the chairman of the committee that brought down the report on which the legislation is based. I have to say to the House that we took a great degree of care and attention in collecting evidence. We sifted it over a fairly substantial time. We worked very hard on those recommendations, which were brought down by the majority of the committee, including myself. Certainly there was a dissenting report from three of the members, but six of the members most definitely supported all the other recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We held this inquiry at the end of 1992. We brought down the report at the beginning of this parliament in 1993. Some time went by before the legislation was introduced. Certainly there is no question in my mind that the legislation faithfully reflects all the recommendations that were in the report. We are now in 1994 with the intention of passing this legislation. So quite a considerable time is involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the committee chairman, I record my thanks to all those who were involved in the report&mdash;those who submitted evidence, the staff who worked on it and the others who gave assistance&mdash;for the very fine work that was done and the contributions that were made by all concerned. I believe that there is a clear case for change&mdash;that is what the report says&mdash;and I certainly do not resile from that position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to comment on some particular aspects of the report. Much has been made about the amount of savings that will be available. Those savings were very specifically identified with particular posts to be abolished. I believe they are very readily achievable. We tried very hard to be conservative in not overestimating the size of those savings just so we could make sure that they would not be held up as some quite ridiculous figure. Given the length of time since the inquiry to the present date, which I have already talked about, there is no doubt in my mind that, on today's figures, those savings will be very much more substantial than the ones quoted in the report. Having questioned a number of witnesses very carefully, there is no doubt in my mind that a lot of extra savings are to be garnered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that one of the most important things about the savings, whatever their size may be, is that we have received and the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) has issued&mdash;I have seen the letter&mdash;a categorical assurance that those savings can be held within the parliament and can be used for providing the extra services that I believe in many ways are necessary for senators and members. So there is a direct benefit to the end users&mdash;that is, us, the senators and members in this parliament. I disagree with the people who have questioned the solidity of those figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comments have also been made about the roles of the two departments and whether they have any degree of compatibility or duplication, and so on and so forth. The report has quite clearly said that, in essence, their functional roles will remain quite distinct and quite separate because they have separate roles functionally in many ways. But the report says that it wants to cut the cost of the administrative tail. Quite clearly, the administrative sections of the departments have to comply with administration required by legislation and there is clear duplication. We should be trying to ensure that we make efficiencies in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps one of the mistakes of the report was that we said, `We want to make sure that we look after the people. We do not want to just chop everybody off at the knees, so we should have natural attrition'. So, of course, some of those savings will come slowly, and appropriately so; nevertheless, they are real for all of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also seems that the library has a fundamental problem in its structure in the sense that, from a salary point of view, it is top heavy with highly paid staff. I am not saying that they should not be highly paid but there are a lot of high quality people in the library, particularly in the research area and they are, therefore, relatively expensive resources. Given the way that finances are run in government areas these days, they will find it increasingly difficult to meet their budgets. By having the advantage of the flexibility of taking up savings that might be made elsewhere in an enlarged department, the library could well benefit. Therefore, it will actually do a disservice to the library if it were not to be amalgamated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increasingly, as I questioned witnesses and as I toured the facilities within the building, there was no doubt in my mind that there were a number of areas where duplication could be cut by such a merger. At the moment there are just too many fiefdoms that, frankly, cause too many duplications. It is also important to recognise that these departments function within a changing environment within the parliament in what we require of those departments. Our role has changed from what it was 10, 15 or 20 years ago, I understand, for those who were here. But I was not here then. I certainly understand that the demands on members now are dramatically greater than they used to be and, therefore, we need significantly better support. The nature of the technology and the tools available for both departments have changed considerably. It seems to me that a change is very appropriate to meet those changing circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also dealt with some of the past problems. I do not think we should gloss over the fact that the problems that occurred over several years were very real&mdash;they concerned not only money but also management practices. The reality is that those problems developed under the existing permanent structure and they were not fixed until we had the present temporary arrangements put in place, which in some form reflect what is proposed in this legislation. So I think the new management has gone some way to fixing a lot of those problems. To go ahead with that, it would be appropriate to make sure that we continue to allow that sort of management structure to stay in place. I do not believe that it will necessarily be a tool of the government of the day, and I would hope that it would not be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to remember that many of the witnesses said to us during the taking of evidence&mdash;this has also been said at witness questioning&mdash;that the most outstanding librarian that most people remembered in history was the only one that was not a professional librarian by training. He was, in fact, a managerial type person. It is that managerial type approach that is resented, I think, by a number of the opponents of this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were many claims about the loss of independence of the library under the proposed arrangements. We spent a great deal of time and effort looking at them and, frankly, those claims, in my view, were simply not supported by evidence. However, given that the claims were obviously widespread and very genuine, the committee bent over backwards to try to build into its recommendations measures that would ensure that those concerns were met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Briefly, there has been comment about the hearings being held in private&mdash;the implication being that something secret and underhand went on. This was an advisory committee&mdash;it was not a full committee of the parliament. All members of the committee were aware from its early meetings that, because it was an advisory committee and not a formal committee of the parliament, its proceedings were not protected by privilege. A number of the witnesses expressed a desire to have their evidence treated confidentially. It was in the interests of the witnesses that all members of the committee agreed up front that the hearings had to be held in private. We would have preferred public hearings but it was not practical or realistic, and it is mischievous to put any other implication on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to close; I am not going on forever. I could go on through the recommendations but I think they are well documented and obviously honourable members have had a long time to read the report since it was tabled nearly a year ago. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I believe that the recommendations in this report are as valid today as they were when the report was brought down. I think the legislation reflects this. I regret that I have been unable to persuade my colleagues in the coalition to that view and obviously I have to respect their rights to a contrary view. The clear view amongst my colleagues is that they do not believe that these measures are appropriate. I think that is particularly so with many senators, but certainly that view is not exclusive to the Senate. I regret that I have not been able to persuade them from that, and that the views which have prevailed are those that have largely been put by the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), who was the previous speaker on this side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the coalition will oppose this legislation. I assume it will go through this chamber. If it goes through the other chamber with the support of the minor parties, then it will be interesting to see just who is right in terms of the real impact of this particular legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am rather saddened by the debate tonight on the Public Service (Parliamentary Departments) Amendment Bill. I think that the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) in his contribution has shown what one could only call infinite flexibility of mind. We hear him and his colleagues in here day after day singing their mantra about micro-economic reform&mdash;that the government has not moved fast enough in these areas and that we have to speed up micro-economic reform&mdash;but when the parliament itself is asked to consider a piece of micro-economic reform, what happens is that the tail wags the dog. I would have thought that the honourable member for Bradfield, who has been here for some little while, would have been sensible enough to wake up to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) has put to the House in the last 10 minutes reconfirms all the reasons that I had in my mind when I sought to appoint him as chairman of the committee that looked at this matter. He went to the committee and looked at the matter impartially. The committee considered the issues and it brought forward a report. At the time, the then President of the Senate and I said that we would be bound by whatever decision the committee came forward with. We appointed a member of the opposition as chairman of it to show good faith on our part and to try to make the point that there was no hidden agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, a small clique of people in two of the other parliamentary departments&mdash;not, I am pleased to say, the Department of the House of Representatives&mdash;have decided that what they really want is for the cosy, sheltered workshop they have worked in all their lives to prevail and, while the rest of the world, the Public Service and industry, can change, the parliamentary departments will be the same as they were in 1901 when they started and in 1927 when they moved here. That is absolutely ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time, to try to make the point, the then President of the Senate and I had the Auditor-General conduct an inquiry into both <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and the library. Honourable members who have participated in this debate should have read those reports. The Auditor-General was pretty scathing in his response. He looked at making recommendations which would make this place a little more efficient, and try to blow some of the winds of change that had occurred in the rest of the public sector into this awful little sheltered workshop here. But the vested interests were not going to be in that. A very self-serving piece of evidence was given to the committee by Mr Brudenall, who was at one stage the acting librarian and is now the deputy librarian. Mr Brudenall puts the argument for all his colleagues up there in the library&mdash;`For goodness sake, don't change'&mdash;because it is very comfortable where they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Library staff are getting very high salaries. They appointed people to positions that did not exist. The assistant secretary in corporate services was being paid an SES salary for a position that was supposed to be for the head of the research service. Other people were filling positions which were not really in the establishment. But this was justified because the library had its captive little group of members and, in particular, senators to whom it provided special services. Whenever any attack was made on the efficiency of this organisation, people came out of the woodwork and said, `We have to support the independence of the library'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one was attacking the independence of the library. We were saying, `For goodness sake, let's have the same sort of working conditions in the library that the public sector might have had maybe in the 1980s or the 1970s'. We were not even suggesting that the library should have the same sort of approach of the 1990s; maybe it could progress from 1927 to 1977. But that did not suit the people in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff has been a lot more progressive. The former President and myself instigated an inquiry into that department. Some dramatic changes were made and we got very real efficiencies. Savings of $3 to $4 million a year were made in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard </EMPHASIS>department which actually works, where people enjoy their life, where people put in a good job and which actually gets us the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> on time. The honourable member for Bradfield will remember, like I do, that when we first came here some 14 or 15 years ago a little note went around every second day saying that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> would be delayed until some time later that day. That does not happen now. Now we get the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the next day. In fact, we will have the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> electronically available on the same day. Those changes are sensible. That department has moved with the times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But people say, `Goodness me, let us not do this in the library', as though the library is some sort of icon that we should not touch. When one talks to people in the library, one would think that the library is an old local municipal library, a book library. Some people obviously thought that. When the former President and I went on a tour through the library, we found that the library was filling up very expensive shelf space with a regular supply, for the interests of members and senators, of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the Republic of South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that hundreds of members and senators were going in each day to look at the airmailed versions of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the Republic of South Africa! I do not think even my friend the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), who was a great supporter of the Republic of South Africa, looked at one of them once. But that was the sort of mind-set that people in the library were in. When we asked them why they got that publication they said, `Well, we got it once, didn't we? We never stopped it, so we keep getting it and we keep filling up shelf space with it; it is there'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When someone says, `Maybe we ought to change this a bit; maybe we ought to get a bit of modern management into this place', the people in the library say, `Goodness, no. Don't do that. That would be awful because you would be interfering with the independence of the library'. No-one wants to interfere with the independence of the library. Those of us on this side and on the other side&mdash;at least those of us who think about it&mdash;realise that the cycle in this place changes. It is inevitable that at some time or other one party will be in government and then it will go out of government. When we go out of government, we need the resources of the library to help us do our job as members. So no-one is going to try to do anything about that. But, for goodness sake, let us make the library work better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report and the proposed legislation are only trying to make things work better. Members and senators will benefit from that. The savings that have been identified are very real. Because of an arrangement that the presiding officers negotiated with the then Minister for Finance, the savings will go straight back to providing services for members and senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot have micro-economic reform here. We must have five little departments with a couple of hundred people in each of them and we must have people who call themselves secretaries to departments. But when presiding officers go along to the Remuneration Tribunal, as the previous presiding officers did and as the current presiding officers have, and say, `Just recognise these people as genuine secretaries to departments', the Remuneration Tribunal says, `Don't be stupid'. It recognises them as just minor agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will get some decent movement in this place if we can lead by example. The point that the presiding officers were trying to make, with the amalgamation of the Department of the Parliamentary Library and the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, was that these two departments have a lot in common. The library is not a book library and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> does not produce paper copy any more. That is not the future of either of those departments; they are about the dissemination of information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No two elements in this building or other parts of the government show a synergy that these two departments show. There are dramatic advantages for both of them in the processing of information for members and senators. That is what they both do and they do it well if they apply their minds to it. To have them providing their services as two separate entities, pulling away from each other, is just damned stupid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the honourable member for Bradfield thinks about this he will agree with it. Unfortunately, he, like the honourable member for Aston, is being dragged along by these people who do not want to see the wood for the trees. At the time, the previous presiding officers were willing to give, as the current presiding officers are willing to give, any number of undertakings that there is no plot in this. It is not an amalgamation of the three departments any more. It will not have any effect on the Senate, the House of Representatives or anything else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only people who will benefit from this amalgamation are members and senators. That is why these two service departments are there. They are not there for self-serving reasons of the people who head them. They are there to provide a service to us as members and senators which is efficient and which should have some of the characteristics of modern management practices. There is nothing of the sort in the Department of the Parliamentary Library. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interim arrangement, where we have the same person as head of the two departments, has at least tried to bring about some of those amalgams of interest that should be there. The type of advice that we got from the Clerk of the Senate and some other people who made submissions to the committee really makes us wonder where they are coming from. From reading some of the things that were said, one would think that the perfect model for some people would be to have seven or eight parliamentary departments, to have anarchy and to have little top-heavy organisations that do not do anything efficiently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bradfield is probably right when he says that he does not think this bill will pass the Senate. The sorrow of this proposal is that no-one is willing to look at the benefits and the advantages in the way that the honourable member for Aston and his committee did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time that I have been here, the only time the government of the day has ever had an opposition member chair a committee that provided legislation to the parliament was when the then honourable member for North Sydney, Mr Spender, who was at the time the chairman of the Standing Committee on Privileges, produced a report which brought forward our current legislation on privilege. The Labor government of the day was saying that what he was doing was of some value and that it would have a look at the outcome. The report of the honourable member for Aston is of some value. The legislation that has flowed from it should be supported. </PARA>

I cannot see how anyone can say that, in any way, shape or form the independence of the library will be compromised. There will still be a library committee which, if it wanted&mdash;I have no doubt of it, if that was a price for getting this idea passed&mdash;could have more say. The honourable member for Bradfield says, `The library committee is not an executive committee, so the fact that it said so was all right is rubbish'. I do not know what more is wanted.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the advisory committee, and as a signatory to the majority report, I thank you, Mr Speaker, for the opportunity to make some comments on the legislation which flows from the report. It is true that the advisory committee was different from other parliamentary committees of inquiry, but that did not mean that it did not faithfully examine the evidence put before it and diligently come to conclusions on the basis of the facts as the committee saw them. We spent considerable time receiving and reviewing evidence, looking at the criticisms which were presented in relation to the proposals and then making recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unusual for an opposition member to be chairman of a committee. I am not quite sure whether the previous Speaker and the former President of the Senate knew that this was an impossible issue and therefore decided that the easiest way to get out of trouble was to put an opposition member in the chair. I hope, rather, that it was a genuine attempt to reach some kind of bipartisan position on this issue. I do not think there is much doubt that the history of bitter argument over this question certainly flowed through into the considerations of the committee and the evidence that was presented to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Going right back to 1901, there have been five parliamentary departments. There have been several attempts over the years to amalgamate various departments and, on occasion, there has even been the view that there should be only a single department. I would always reject that view because I think that would impinge upon the independence of the Senate and the House of Representatives as separate chambers with particular functions. There would always need to be a service department. That does not mean we should always resist every change and every proposed efficiency in the management and operation of the departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1988 the then Speaker, Mrs Child, introduced a bill to amalgamate three departments&mdash;Joint House, the Parliamentary Library and the Parliamentary Reporting Staff. No doubt that proposal also had some merit, but it was opposed at the time and not pursued. In 1992 Mr Templeton, the Secretary to the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff and Acting Parliamentary Librarian, made a submission to the presiding officers arguing for the amalgamation of the current Department of the Parliamentary Library and the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years there have been management problems in both departments. There have been unfavourable audit reports which have dealt very critically with the operations of both of these significant parliamentary departments. In 1989 there was criticism of the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff that led to some considerable reforms. Audit Report (No. 6) of 1990-91 into the Department of the Parliamentary Library also contained much criticism and, particularly, concerns about the lack of leadership and poor management within that department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is often said that if one cannot manage the parliament, how can one manage the country? It really reflects poorly on the parliament as a whole to have regularly unsatisfactory audit reports being made into the departments which support this House and its operations. We have a clear responsibility to demonstrate to the Australian people that we can run our parliament efficiently and well. We must do that if we expect to earn the right to govern this country. We must earn the respect of the people for being able to manage our affairs wisely and well, and be entrusted with the responsibility of influencing their lives and their activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have an obligation to ensure that this parliament runs efficiently, and also that where there are savings to be made they are indeed made. In this particular instance, the committee was able to establish&mdash;and, I believe, demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt&mdash;that savings of the order of at least $340,000 and probably $500,000 were achievable as a result of this measure. Much of that will be achieved as a result of a more efficient and leaner corporate staff, which would be reduced from some 67 people to 54. Of course, these are June 1991 figures. That represents a considerable saving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) rightly pointed out, a large number of people, particularly staff of the Parliamentary Library, are attached in this corporate services area. Ironically, even though the total number of staff in the library is 192, at the time of the inquiry it had 37 corporate staff, or 19 per cent of its total staffing number. The Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, a much larger organisation, with 354 staff, had only 30 corporate staff, or eight per cent. This new proposal would result in an organisation of 534 staff with 10 per cent involved in corporate services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this move there is an obvious potential for savings&mdash;savings that will increase as the years go by and as the benefits accrue. It would also mean additional resources being available to fund the other activities that are so essential to the library's day-to-day operations. It has been clearly established that a potential benefit of perhaps half a million dollars a year would flow from these proposals. However, a number of people have said that the price is too high to pay; that we need to pay extra amounts of money to achieve various objectives for the library. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern raised most often was the independence of the library. Independence is something that is prized by all members of parliament. I think we would regard that as a fundamental feature of any library attempting to effectively service the members of this House. But I do not accept that the proposal before the House in any way interferes with the independence of the library. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As mentioned by previous speakers, a number of amendments have been proposed&mdash;changes to the original proposal put forward by Mr Templeton&mdash;to guarantee that independence. The office of librarian will be retained. The Parliamentary Library Committee will be retained in its current role, with the librarian acting as secretary to that particular committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have served on the library committee and I have never found it to be a particularly effective organisation. It was rarely consulted on matters of importance. In fact, while I was on the committee, the librarian of the day was moved aside and the committee was not even told about it. So basic issues such as that were not even referred to the committee. Obviously, it was perceived by the library staff as an important element of their security, so it has been preserved in these proposed new arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opportunity for the librarian to report and make representations directly to the presiding officers has been maintained. That also guarantees that no new bureaucratic head can get in the way of their direct access to the houses of this parliament. They are also going to have the opportunity to present independent sections in the departmental report to this House. All of those things guarantee independence for the library. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is there anything incongruous about amalgamation with the reporting service? Surely it also has an obligation to be independent and to treat all sides of the House equally and fairly. They both have that obligation so I see no problem in them sharing joint management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also concern amongst library staff that this amalgamation would result in resources being transferred from the library and into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> section. Frankly, I think the reverse is more likely. It is a fact that both departments have lumpy workloads. Their responsibilities change according to whether the parliament is or is not sitting. There is a long period before and after elections when there is often limited call on their services. In those circumstances, this proposal would provide greater flexibility for staff to be moved from one section to the other and guarantee better utilisation of their resources. The technology in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> is likely to free up people, providing extra help in the library section. I suspect that the transfer of staff following a merger of the departments would benefit rather than disadvantage the library. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also concern that the library is smaller than <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and that therefore it would be out-voted or out-muscled on issues. Again, I think that is highly unlikely. In any event, it would be a single merged department working cooperatively together. It would not be a them and us situation but an example of benefit to all. The library has such particular day-to-day contact with members of parliament that I think their position would always be strong in any argument that might happen to develop between them and the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, from time to time it was suggested&mdash;I found this point particularly difficult to comprehend&mdash;that somehow or other this proposal interfered with the independence of the Senate. Some senators argued that they use the library more than members of the House of Representatives&mdash;I do not know whether that is true&mdash;and that therefore this proposal adversely affected the Senate. I would have to say that I regard all of the objections as having little merit and that the genuine points of concern that were raised in evidence before the committee were adequately addressed during the development of this particular proposal. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some genuine criticisms of the way in which the library is performing. I share some of those with previous members who have spoken. There are occasions when service is poor and when money is wasted on books and other library resources of low priority. It is inevitable that that is likely to occur.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I sat through three days of evidence with this advisory committee. I listened to a whole range of problems being raised by various witnesses.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some criticism over recent days about a half million dollar project to alter the design of the entry to the library. I would say that the design of the library leaves a lot to be desired and that there is room for considerable improvement in the reception area and the way in which the whole layout of the library is presented. For the life of me, I cannot understand how it could possibly cost half a million dollars to shift furniture, a painting, or other things of that nature around, and that needs to be examined. I accept the need for changes in the design of the library, but surely half a million dollars seems to be an extraordinary cost. But, we cannot stand up and criticise a half million dollar one-off capital cost and then turn a blind eye to half a million dollars being unnecessarily spent every year because of improvements to efficiency and reductions in staff numbers which could be achieved without any loss to the efficiency and standard of service provided by the library. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that this proposal will of itself give us a particularly better library, but the measure will save around half a million dollars a year&mdash;and that is half a million dollars that can be directed to providing better services or reducing the costs of running this parliament. Both of those objectives should be grasped. When this parliament has an opportunity to make a saving, it must accept that opportunity. We bear a lot of pain for small savings that are made from year to year to our national budget. Here is an opportunity for the parliament to make a saving that I believe will create no pain but will give an opportunity to provide better services to all members. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As was so eloquently pointed out by the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) and, indeed, the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) in their contributions, together with those of the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) and the honourable member for Watson, what is being proposed is a department which reflects information services. It is to complement, as was said in the second reading speech, a physical services department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been pointed out that savings were identified. As the honourable member for Aston rightly pointed out, it was some time ago that this report was presented and the savings that would come from this proposal would probably be greater. There was a comment made&mdash;the honourable member for Chifley first raised it; but others commented on it&mdash;about those savings and what would happen to the money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my second reading speech I indicated that the Department of Finance had given a guarantee&mdash;the best one can get from the Department of Finance&mdash;that the savings would go to and remain with the new department to enhance services for members and senators. I will go one better because the former Minister for Finance, now Treasurer (Mr Willis), in a letter to me of 21 December, confirmed in correspondence:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the basis that the financial arrangements and procedures for the new Department will be within the auspices of the running costs system, I can assure you that the level of resources provided to the new Department upon its creation will be the sum of the budgets of the current two Departments.</PARA>
<PARA>I table that letter for the benefit of honourable members, who perhaps may like to discuss this a little further, particularly those who have the opportunity to talk about it with senators as the legislation is to go there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to pick up one or two other points that were raised by honourable members. The honourable member for Wide Bay is of the view that a single department running the parliament was feasible and rejected that as a concept. I too reject that as a concept. In my second reading speech when I introduced this legislation I said on behalf of the then President and me:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not believe that any further reduction in the number of parliamentary service departments is warranted and we do not intend to propose that there be any further changes.</PARA>
<PARA>That is important because the honourable member for Watson referred to concerns about the attitudes being displayed by senior parliamentary officers within this building about the reasons for this legislation coming forward. I must say that I share those concerns. As a Presiding Officer, I find it disturbing when I learn of very strongly held views of senior officers within this place where those views are sought to be imposed on some members and senators for other reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that respect I am reminded of a comment made by a senior officer of the parliament to the former President immediately prior to his departure. He said, `You will never get this proposal up because I do not support it'. I think it is fair to say that that particular person is doing whatever he can to ensure that that happens. I was going to quote from a document in which he actually spells out his view that the library is a now threatened institution of the parliament, but perhaps I will leave that to another time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the contribution made by the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly). I am charitable enough to say to the honourable member for Bradfield that I understand his position as the shadow minister for privatisation and administrative services and, from time to time, we all do not like the position that we are in. I might also express some sympathy for the honourable member for Aston as the chairman of the committee and his colleague the honourable member for Wide Bay who find that, when they bring forward a report which is adopted by the parliament and subsequently further action is proposed to be put in place, they are suddenly left deserted. A comment about a similar exercise which I had something to do with was made this afternoon by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) when commenting about parliamentary procedure. So we are soul mates in that respect. The honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) made one or two comments upon which I think I should respond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As he pointed out, the minority report was really done by three senators. The majority report was done by senators and members of the House of Representatives from both sides. I do not believe for a minute&mdash;otherwise I, along with the President, would not have decided to push on with this particular piece of legislation&mdash;that the six or so reasons that the honourable member for Bradfield referred to in that minority report hold. I could sit here for the next two hours arguing and putting forward valid reasons why those reasons do not hold, but I think the other people who have contributed tonight have done just that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of the independence of the library is one that really amuses me. I do not think that anybody in this place has defended the independence of the library as vigorously as the person who is the Acting Parliamentary Librarian. Yet I know and members in this place would know that they received some information towards the end of last year about that particular position&mdash;perhaps even that person, as I recall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I place on record today that the Secretary to the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff who is also the Acting Parliamentary Librarian has done nothing but defend the independence of the library during the development of this piece of legislation. He has ensured faithfully that the recommendations of the majority report have been encapsulated here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying one or two things to the honourable member for Bradfield about the comments that were made regarding the proposal for refitting the library, which was also referred to by the honourable member for Wide Bay. The first thing that I need to say&mdash;the honourable member for Bradfield referred to this&mdash;is that that particular matter has gone to the Parliamentary Library Committee on quite a number of occasions. There were plans and a model was considered. It was not a decision that was taken lightly by the Presiding Officers. On a couple of occasions we actually sent it back for further assessment before we made a final decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Watson had a valid point when he talked about the role that the library committee plays. Yes, the library committee is advisory, but that is the role of a number of other committees of this parliament. As the Presiding Officer to whom that committee reports, along with the President of the Senate, I take very seriously the advice I get from the committee. I hope members of the committee believe that when they deliberate on issues, vote on particular issues and give advice to us they are making a contribution to the running of this place. I say to them that I certainly value that advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the cost factor, it may well be that the amount of money talked about for the redevelopment of the library foyer&mdash;which, incidentally, did come largely as a result of the audit office recommendations&mdash;to improve the circulation in that section of the library, in my view, possibly could be looked at again. We are talking of ballpark figures and it may well be that there are ways in which we can get around that. But I say to the honourable member for Bradfield, as I am sure he would know, that any funding that would come for a project such as that would come from capital works, which would be a separate vote, and would not therefore come from the savings which would be occasioned by streamlining the administration in both the parliamentary reporting and the library departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding the role the honourable member for Bradfield has been compelled to play this evening, I hope people seriously have another look at this proposal. At the end of the day, I think it makes a lot of sense and, if people would only read the second reading speech and the advisory committee report again, they would see that the proposal that has come forward is factual and is based on a realistic assessment of the needs of this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by simply saying, as I did previously, that all of those people who participated in the discussions on this issue and those people who served on the committee served their parliament well and they served their colleagues well with the recommendations they brought down. I hoped and I thought that the President of the Senate and I served them well by implementing in this legislation all of their recommendations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take the opportunity to say a few words about Brian Archer, who retired from the Senate on 31 January. Brian was elected to the Senate from Tasmania in 1975 and had over 18 years of tireless and loyal service to the Liberal Party, the Australian Senate and to Tasmania. The continuity of his service made him one of the longest serving senators when he retired last week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tasmania was Brian's birthplace, his home and his  passion. He was a dedicated advocate, facilitator and promoter of the welfare and development of his island state and its natural and human resources. He had a particular interest in all Tasmanian resource industries&mdash;horticulture, agriculture, mining, forestry, pulp and paper, inland fisheries and sea fisheries. There was many a Tasmanian farmer, trawlerman or small business person who was grateful for Brian's patient and painstaking assistance for the troubling problem. The extent of his interests ran far beyond regular constituency matters and limits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On many occasions his unflagging enthusiasm for responsible development projects and innovative value added technology sustained particular projects when difficulties were encountered. His network of contacts throughout the state was extensive and he was charming, cheerful and steadfast in pursuing inquiries and mustering assistance for any project or job creating investor in whom he believed. Belief was an important strand in Brian's character. The fundamental fairness, decency and straightness with which he treated all persons, irrespective of politics or background, marked him as a man of natural quality and dignity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Brian was a quiet, dedicated worker in Senate, on coalition committees in this parliament and in Tasmania. His modest self-effacement was encapsulated in his self-description as a nuts-and-bolts man. However, this masked the impact and value of his efforts. Brian served as opposition shadow special minister of state and shadow minister for science. He was on numerous Senate and joint committees, including the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania, of which he was chairman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The breadth and depth of Brian's knowledge about his state, its industries and the people who work in them were remarkable. His interests frequently drove his expertise beyond Tasmania. In surface and deep sea fishing, in timber and in dairying, for example, his national knowledge was extensive and generously available to those who sought it. Brian came from a broad industry background, and his tireless work on the Senate industry committee is widely acknowledged. Brian was also a man of wide interests outside parliament. He played and contributed to the administration of many sports, ran his farm at Boat Harbour and bred quality Limousin cattle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Brian's enthusiasm, balance and integrity were assets to the parliament. His belief in the potential of Australia and his global perspective, coupled with local knowledge and understanding, were a constant inspiration. He possessed a sound, natural wisdom and was a valued member of the coalition team. He will be missed on all sides of politics. I pay tribute to him and his record in public life. He will be missed in this place by his many friends. A former Minister for Science and Technology, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), is in the House at the moment. He may wish to add to what I have said. I wish Brian and his wife, Dorothy, every happiness and contentment in retirement at Riverside, near Launceston, and I wish him many happy years to come. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this adjournment debate to bring to the attention of the House some information which refers to actions taken by Premier Fahey and his New South Wales government. One of the industries which has been an integral part of my home town of Kiama is the basalt, or bluestone, quarries. They have been a hallmark of the area for well over 100 years. Kiama was an Irish town&mdash;a town that was brought up on the backs of the working-class people of that area. Some 50 families have had long-term involvement in those quarries. In fact, I know of one family in which members of the family from the grandfather through to the grandson worked together on the one shift.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in the light of the long history of that quarry that we look at the actions of the state Liberal government. The State Rail Authority asked the people in these quarries to turn around and do something about their performance at work. They entered into agreements and did everything that they possibly could to increase the productivity of those quarries on the basis of an understanding that if they lifted the productivity of that particular quarry then their jobs would be safe. That is not what has happened.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, as I understand it&mdash;from my friends, whom I have known nearly all my life and who work on those quarries&mdash;what they got out of all their hard pain and readjustments was a kick in the guts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have figures from Coopers and Lybrand, consultants, who have done a very close analysis of the financial position of three of the hard rock quarries owned by the State Rail Authority&mdash;at Bombo, which is in my electorate of Gilmore, at Martins Creek and at Ardglen. I would like to find out whose federal seats those other two quarries are in, because I think they would be interested in the figures. The results show that the percentage return on the funds invested in Bombo quarry is 31 per cent; in Martins Creek, 93 per cent; and in Ardglen, 648 per cent. One would imagine that, with the Olympic Games coming to Sydney, the ownership of a hard</PARA>
<PARA>rock quarry would be a goldmine. That is in fact the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that I am really uptight about is that it was brought to my attention by one of the employees&mdash;and they are employees of the State Rail Authority; I obviously cannot indicate the name of that individual because that person will then be intimidated and treated like less than dirt&mdash;that one of the former Greiner appointees to the State Rail Authority board now happens to be a member of the board of Boral quarries. It just happens to be that Boral is in the adjacent quarry. Mr Baird, having received appeals from the unions and the people of Kiama saying, `Leave this quarry alone; leave these people in employment in our town', has sent a message back saying that it will be sold, irrespective of what these people's dedication has achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that something is rotten in the state of Denmark. Something smells of fish when we find that an executive of the State Rail Authority is now in a quarrying company, and it looks as though Mr Baird is hell bent on selling these quarries which have a good return. Bombo has a 31 per cent return on funds invested; Martins Creek, 93 per cent; and Ardglen, 648 per cent. I suggest that a deal of corruption is perhaps going on here. I would really like to see someone get to the core of this issue. I would like the state government to give the reason why it would sell profitable outlets like this when, in fact, its cost of supplying hard rock for its state rail quarries will go up from $4.20 to $8.50 a tonne.
