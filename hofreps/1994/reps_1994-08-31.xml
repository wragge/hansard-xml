<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill, I say at the outset that I am one member of this House who is absolutely dedicated to the concept of justice and equality for all Australians. It is absolutely vital in every approach we make to the business of the parliament of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of that belief in the equality of all and the need for people to be treated the same before the law, any special funding or activity provided should be on the basis of need. I totally reject the need for special funding on the basis of race, creed or any other distinction of that kind. Having said that, it is totally obvious that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of Australia are in need. Therefore, I do not quibble with the provision of special funding to assist them to live their lives to the full and to achieve justice and equality in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said before in this place&mdash;I will not go on at length about it, but it needs to be said again&mdash;I reject the guilt industry and I proclaim again that I personally feel no guilt for what has happened in the past. I regret that those things have happened. I acknowledge that the history of Australia in its treatment of its indigenous people has not been all that any of us would require. We should not live in the past; we should learn from the past. Our great need today is to go forward in a spirit of reconciliation and to provide for the future wellbeing of all Australians, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am, quite frankly, not opposed to the provisions of this bill. A number of areas in the bill need amendment. The various offers made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) and the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), in their contributions yesterday are genuine offers. We are attempting to take a bipartisan approach to this issue. We, as a coalition, are committed to the process of reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am somewhat disappointed that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), in his reaction to what was being said yesterday, more often than not merely interjected `trickery'. I am disappointed that he would take that approach without having even seen the amendments. I do not think that is up to his usual standard. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Hicks" NAMEID="AH4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AH4">Mr Hicks</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A very sensitive issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AE4">Mr NEHL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very sensitive issue, as my colleague says. I fully and totally believe that we in this place should be approaching consideration of the land fund in a genuine spirit of cooperation, tolerance and understanding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems of our Aboriginal people will not be solved just by buying more land. I sense that the contributions being made by government members&mdash;I acknowledge their sincerity in seeking to do something for our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people&mdash;have a sort of cargo cult mentality. They think that, if they buy land for Aboriginal people, that will solve all of their problems. That is not the case. The reality is that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are beset by the most appalling conditions and standards of health, education, housing and lack of employment. We cannot divorce these issues from the general question of Aboriginal welfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think some members of the government have misunderstood what we are seeking to do in mentioning issues such as health, education, housing and employment in the same breath as the land fund. We are trying to illustrate and make clear beyond doubt that buying land alone will not solve the problems of Aboriginal people. Other speakers have illustrated quite clearly that where Aboriginal people have land and have had it for very long times there has been no real improvement in health. In fact, the worst health problems are in areas of the Northern Territory, such as Arnhem Land, where Aboriginal people have owned their own land for a very long time. I make that point because I believe all of Australia should be aware that the provision of land will not solve the problem. It is an important thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been said time and time again by members on both sides of the House, we appreciate that Aboriginal people have a special spiritual and even mystical association with the land. I think it is fair to say that a great many ordinary white Australians feel the same relationship. Even though most European origin or non-Aboriginal Australians do not manifest it in the same way, I think they can understand that relationship. This is why there is no great quibble over the provision of the land fund. However, I think one very important misconception has been fostered. I imagine some government members might be inclined to say that we on this side are being scaremongers. If that were the case, that would be wrong of us. I can recall that last year the then Special Minister of State, the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Walker), made a statement about billions of dollars being spent on land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that technically $1.5 billion will be provided over something like 10 years. The rest of Australia and the Aboriginal people should be aware that this is a bit of a con. There will not actually be $1 1/2 billion spent on buying land. That is not the case at all. The money will be put into the trust fund&mdash;that is very clearly illustrated on the back page of the bill's explanatory memorandum&mdash;and will be invested. Ultimately, the interest from that money will be provided to purchase some land. Quite clearly, what we are looking at is approximately $45 million a year being provided for the next nine or 10 years. Already $21 million of that is being provided to ATSIC, so in reality we are talking about $24 million a year being provided. All I can say to our Aboriginal brethren is, `Don't get too excited because not a great deal will come from it.' I also say to non-Aboriginal Australians, `Don't get too concerned about burgeoning expenditure because it will not happen.'</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Braithwaite" NAMEID="0F4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0F4">Mr Braithwaite</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The biggest problem is the raising of expectations.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AE4">Mr NEHL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have suffered a great disservice because their expectations have been raised. For instance, not all of that extra $24 million a year will be available to buy land, because the Indigenous Land Corporation, which will be undertaking land acquisition activities, will still have to provide land management activities and running costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have difficulty in dissociating land from houses, because most of us want to live on land. Okay, you might say that people in high rises are up in the winds, but whether you are an Aboriginal or a non-Aboriginal Australian you have a house of some kind on land. I find it difficult to dissociate the concept of housing from the land fund&mdash;there is no point in buying land just for the sake of buying land. There has to be some benefit for Aboriginal people. There is no point in using taxpayers' money to buy land, letting it sit there and continuing to let people live in Third World conditions. It is not good enough. That is not what Australia is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will put that $24 million of new money into some sort of context. At home, in Coffs Harbour, the average house costs about $120,000, so the $24 million would buy 200 new houses a year. I could use those 200 new houses just in one part of my electorate, the Macleay Valley, to provide a decent standard of accommodation for my Aboriginal constituents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is why I say to Aboriginal people, `Don't get too excited,' and I say to non-Aboriginal people, `Don't get too worried about an enormous flow of money because the $1.5 billion that is mentioned doesn't actually get spent.' By the way, I should tell our Aboriginal brethren too that they do not control the money; it is not theirs. It is still in the Commonwealth's funds. I feel that everybody in Australia should be aware of the real context in which those funds have been allocated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill does not really give any indication of the benefits that are going to flow to Aboriginal communities, which is an important omission. There should be some indication in the bill of what the benefit to Aboriginal men, women and children is going to be. To my mind, it is all still a little too vague. After all, the bill is very general. It does not give any direction of the key purposes for buying land or how purchases will assist either outback or urban Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. How are the people who live in Redfern going to benefit from this bill? Does anybody know? Certainly the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has not told us, and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has not told us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned the Macleay Valley in my electorate. How are the Aboriginal people who live in Kempsey going to benefit? In the next 10 days I am spending most of one day at Old Burnt Bridge to once again meet with people to see how we can perhaps get some of them out of the humpies. They are not out in the Pitjantjatjara lands. They are on the north coast of New South Wales living without a decent water supply and without sewerage. This is totally unacceptable. That is why I cannot go along with this concept of buying land and saying, `There you are fellas. There's your land.'</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Hicks" NAMEID="AH4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AH4">Mr Hicks</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That will not help them at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AE4">Mr NEHL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That in itself is not going to help them at all. We are proposing that this bill should be sent to a committee of the Senate for fuller examination. It is too important to all Australians just to let it go through. I again make the point that we are seriously and deliberately trying to adopt a bipartisan approach to this matter. We ask the government to try to see that. I ask the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs not to just keep calling out, `Trickery, trickery, trickery.' We are not in the trickery business at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is significant that the bill calls for five of the seven members of the board to be Aboriginal people. I have no objection to that. As far as I am concerned, the whole seven members of the board could be, or perhaps even should be, Aboriginal people. There is one particular point that I reject in terms of the qualifications of the board of directors. The explanatory memorandum states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . all of the Directors must have experience in land or environmental management, business or financial management, or in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community life.</PARA>
<PARA>Quite frankly, that is no qualification at all. It is totally paternalistic. The government can say that if board members have experience in Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community life&mdash;in other words, if they are an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander and have lived in a community&mdash;that is all the qualification they need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an in-built assumption that Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people are not going to qualify on the basis of the experience needed in land or environmental management or business and financial management. I have news for anybody who thinks that. Undoubtedly, while our education system has widely failed Aboriginal people&mdash;the level of literacy and  numeracy is totally unacceptable&mdash;there are a great many bright Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people out there and there are a great many who are qualified. They are qualified not just by their having lived in an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community but because of their ability and intelligence to compete with anyone. It is wrong for us to say, `Yes, you can be on the board as an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. All you have to do is be one.' That is a cop-out; it is not good enough. I do not think Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people would see it that way either. They need to be treated the same as other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite a number of amendments will be proposed to this bill and more will come through in the Senate. We believe that priority in purchasing land must go to those areas where Aboriginal people cannot claim native title. The whole purpose of the land fund is to provide money to assist Aboriginal people who are unable to claim under native title to get some land. It should be made quite clear that priority has to go that way. Where there is a need for the upgrading of Aboriginal and pastoral properties, Aboriginals should be given priority. If Aboriginals already have a substantial land holding, it is important that they should be assisted in maintaining them as an economic and viable activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of this, there has to be absolute accountability to the taxpayers of Australia. It is in the best interests of all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people that they be above suspicion and there should be full and proper accountability provisions. Otherwise, it may lead to a bit of a backlash. Most importantly, the money has to go where it is supposed to go. I speak from a wide range of experience of contact with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and individuals. I am the Deputy Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and, in the course of the last 18 months, I have visited many Aboriginal communities and spoken with an enormous number of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Kerr" NAMEID="RH4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RH4">Mr Kerr</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And have shown genuine commitment for many years. I recognise that.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AE4">Mr NEHL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the minister. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are genuinely concerned that the money gets to where it is supposed to go; that it is not siphoned off in some form of bureaucracy. Many criticisms have been levelled at ATSIC because of this. Every one of us in this place must share the genuine concern of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people that the money gets to where it is supposed to go. I sincerely hope that this will be the case with the land fund money. I acknowledge that some money will have to be spent on running costs and land management activities, but the basic point of this is that the money should be used to buy land for Aborigines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There needs to be some expansion on what is happening and where the money is going to go. Again I ask: what about the Aboriginal people in Redfern? What about the Aboriginal people in my electorate and in many other communities? How are they going to be helped by this? In fairness to all Aboriginal people, we need to ask just how this will assist them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the minute that is left I want to come back to what I believe is the basic and the crucial point. It is not good enough just to provide land and let people continue to live in unhealthy Third World conditions. That is what we have in Australia in far too many areas. Let us by all means provide money to buy land for Aboriginal people, but we cannot neglect the need of Aboriginal people for health, education and housing and, above all, their need for a job, with the dignity and self-respect that comes from having a job. If you speak to Aboriginal people you will find that they want that self-respect; they want that dignity. They want to get on with the job of being Australian, like other Australians. They want to participate fully in Australian society. This parliament should do everything it can to assist that. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In six years time we come to the turn of the century. As we approach the year 2000 it concentrates people's minds on where we are going and what is the future of our country. Six years time is more than a major milestone; it is an important time for us to set a peg on where we are as Australians. When we get to that time we should be able to say that we have done something to ensure that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people of  Australia are participating in the wealth and opportunities of this country. Governments and people of goodwill have tried over the years to improve their participation but, to be fair, in many instances we have failed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout those debates in the last 20 years the Aboriginal people have said to us that a central tenet of their participation is the question of land. Governments have shied away from that. They have done some things, but they have not done much. In the last year the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the government have said, `We should take up this issue of land and see if this parliament and this country can adopt an attitude that allows the people to take a view that if land is the issue which the Aboriginal and Torres Strait island people see as the vehicle that will help them to participate better in Australia we should do something about that.' The native title legislation and this legislation are central to the government's attempts to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is rather depressing when you listen to the debate on the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill to see how disheartening the approach of the opposition is. The other day my colleague the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) remarked that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) was like a snake. In some ways he probably hit the nail on the head. It is only too apparent when it comes to the Opposition's policy on this issue that its leader has no policy legs. The opposition is desperately trying to buy time as it searches for a response to this legislation&mdash;any response. Suddenly we hear a lot of talk about how the opposition wants to support the bill but, as my colleague the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) said a few minutes ago, with amendments&mdash;always with amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that if the opposition were serious about amending the legislation it would show us the amendments. We are two-thirds of the way through the debate on this bill in this House and there is nothing on the table. We get told by the opposition that the amendments are on their way. We also get told that they might be made in the Senate. I think we ought to hear a little bit more from the opposition than their chant and mantra about accountability. If the opposition wants to talk about how this bill needs amending, at least it could tell us what amendments it wants to make. Throughout the debate so far&mdash;and there have been over a dozen speakers&mdash;we have not heard anything other than the bill is flawed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is not flawed. This is a good bill. It gives Aboriginal people who do not have the right to make a land claim some access to land, and they say that is important to them. I think it was a reasonable response on the government's part to say that it will attempt to do something about that. If the opposition were serious about wanting to support the bill, why did it not take part in the consultation process and make some suggestions to the government at that stage?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is not even sure why it is opposed to this legislation. It is apparent from hearing the mishmash of interventions from the other side that there is a great deal of angst in the opposition. The honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) and the honourable member for Cowper had some nice things to say, but their problem is that they have been outgunned by the deep conservatives in their party and they are going to vote for amendments that they know will try to destroy parts of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The accountability that the rednecks in the opposition want will mean that we cannot spend most of the money. The opposition does not want accountability; it wants to tie the money up in such a fashion that it will never be able to be spent. That is disgraceful. It is disgraceful that the member for Bradfield and others stand up in here and piously say that they think this is a good thing but that they are not going to vote for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some pieces of legislation that come into this chamber that are of high national importance. There is also a lot of legislation that comes through this place that is important where we take party lines. On a bill such as this, people of goodwill on both sides should try to reach some accommodation. The Prime Minister tried to reach some accommodation. He had a very wide-ranging discussion with state Premiers, indigenous people, business people and farmer organisations to see whether we could get a bill that had widespread support. The only group that did not want to be involved in that was the opposition. It just wants to say that the bill needs to be amended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is driving the opposition is a view that takes us back 20 years to a time when we could get away with being patronising and saying that we know right. That is despite the recommendations of the coalition's backbench policy committee on immigration, ethnic affairs and Aboriginal affairs. It has urged the Leader of the Opposition to support the legislation in toto. To hear the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) talk about how vital it is to have consensus and bipartisanship on an important social justice issue like this is just astounding when we know that the opposition intends to move amendments which will gut this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite will piously stand up and say, `If only the government had accepted the amendments we would have voted for the bill,' knowing that those amendments they will put forward will make the bill useless. If the amendments were not of that fashion we would have them to look at in this debate. The opposition knows that the amendments it is going to put forward will not be of assistance to this bill. The amendments will mean that Aboriginal people will not have any say in the way the money is spent. The amendments will ensure that the basic thrust of the bill, which is to give some empowerment to Aboriginal people, is taken away. The opposition is just wasting the time of the parliament by talking about these amendments at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, we heard some fine sentiments expressed by the member for Bradfield and the member for Chisholm. I agree with them that there should be bipartisanship on this important piece of legislation, but they and their moderate colleagues in the Liberal Party should have the strength of character to do something about this piece of legislation by supporting it and voting for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All we hear from the opposition is that there is some mysterious inadequacy of financial accountability. We would all like to know exactly what should be done to strengthen the accountability. The government has done its best to ensure that the legislation contains some very tight guidelines. As members would know, the land fund is to be established as part of the Commonwealth public account. As such, it is governed by some provisions of the Audit Act which protect Commonwealth funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision by the government to place the land fund in the public account was taken to reduce its impact on the budget. A range of investments are permitted under section 62B of the Audit Act which limit those investments so that they are as secure as possible&mdash;far more secure than most investments that could be made by other instrumentalities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill establishes the land fund to receive moneys which will make allocations to the Indigenous Land Corporation for land acquisition and management. The government will provide $200 million to the fund in this year's budget. The bill provides continuing allocations of $121 million, indexed in terms of 1994 dollars, for a further nine years. So the fund will become a revolving, self-sustaining investment and management fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This fund, as the other leg of the Mabo legislation, will achieve some measure of independence and self-sustainable investment for Torres Strait Islanders and Aboriginal people. The new land corporation will be independent and commercially oriented, with a dedicated focus on land matters and specialised expertise in land environmental management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Cowper said earlier that it was terrible that the government had said that the members of the board of the fund should have some knowledge of financial management or land management or should be experienced in Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community living. He says that it is tokenistic for the government to say that someone can be a member of the board simply because he or she is an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. But I think the member for Cowper has missed the real thrust of this legislation. This bill accepts that what the Aboriginal people have said to the government over the years about their desire to have land is correct: they should have the right to have control over land or, if they are not able to make the land claim, they should have the right to be able to purchase land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is that spiritual view which Aboriginal people have about land that is one reason for the qualification that you can be a member of the board because you are an Aboriginal or a Torres Strait Islander who understands the feelings of those people. If those people wish to invest in some of the land, they might need certain input from someone who is an Aboriginal or a Torres Strait Islander. It is important to not just have people on the board who are experts in particular technical areas. You should also have some members on the board who can add that philosophical input that comes from living in an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that sort of input is important in this body's deliberations. It would be like saying that the trustees of the Catholic Church or the Church of England should have only lawyers and accountants on its board and should not have priests or bishops. The trustees of religious organisations have priests and bishops on their boards because, of course, they add another dimension to the considerations of those boards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the same reason, for the board of this corporation to have people whose only qualification is that they are an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander adds another dimension to the deliberations of the fund. I think that is a very important reason for putting that qualification in there. For sure, it would be nice to have Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders as the land managers and accountants, but I think it would be very useful to have the input of an elder in the community into the deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thrust of this piece of legislation and the native title legislation is to add that dimension to the government's involvement in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people themselves have said to us it has a spiritual dimension. The muddied thinking of some members of the opposition who see this as tokenistic is quite wrong. The injection of those other thoughts into the operation of the board, I think, will be very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard yesterday the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) claiming to be concerned for the welfare of indigenous people. Of course, he, like some of the other hardliners in the opposition, had it absolutely wrong. He suggested that the ownership of land had nothing to do with the welfare, health, housing or education of Aboriginal people. He said that the word `assimilation' was politically incorrect to use and that indigenous people did not want to be treated as different or separate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that point, he is probably a little bit right. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people do not want to be considered as separate and they do not want to be made second-class citizens in the way they have been. They have said to us that they think they can overcome that by having access to land. Six years before the turn of the century and the turn of the millennium, we ought to be saying, `If that is what they say will allow them to participate fully as Australians in the Australian community, then that is what we will try.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People who hold the same view as the member for Barker have put forward their proposals in the past and they have failed. The member for Cowper is right. Many Aboriginal people in Australia live in Third World country conditions. It is disgraceful and we as Australians should be ashamed of the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, many people of goodwill have tried to find ways to assist the participation of indigenous people. In some ways we have been successful, but in many we have been failures. This legislation and the native title legislation give us a chance to take a new approach. This approach will be successful because it is the approach that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have been saying to us for a generation they believe will help them to become part of the future of this country. I think we need to give them that chance. We need to adopt an approach to this legislation that is not negative and nasty. We do not need the approach, `We are going to be clever little politicians here today, we are going to support the bill if the government guts it with our amendments.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is not going to gut it. I have not seen an issue that has united the Labor Party as much as the thrust of this legislation and the whole of the Mabo package. There is no-one in the government who really disagrees with the thrust of it. What the opposition ought to consider between now and when this bill comes to a vote is the outpouring of support for that beautiful young girl Cathy Freeman when she showed to the world that she was an Aboriginal Australian. A couple of people on the other side tried to say, `Isn't this disgraceful; she didn't carry the Australian flag&mdash;terrible, terrible, terrible.' What did the people of Australia say?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to this ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994, I seek to make a contribution which is both positive in tone and positive in content. However, I will not ignore the comments of some government members critical of the attitude of the coalition to the bill. Regrettably, I have some serious criticisms of the proposals in the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is beyond dispute that the coalition has played a significant and pioneering role in Aboriginal affairs generally and in Aboriginal land in particular. The coalition has long recognised the importance of land to indigenous people. The Aboriginal affairs policy adopted by the coalition in November 1975, nearly 20 years ago, provided:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we recognise that fundamental to the Aborigines' sense of Aboriginality&mdash;of affinity with one another&mdash;is their affinity with the land.</PARA>
<PARA>The significance of that policy is that it guided successive coalition governments and successive ministers for Aboriginal affairs in coalition governments from 1975 until 1983. It was also the basis of the first enactment of Aboriginal land rights legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until the decision of the High Court in Mabo v. Queensland No. 2, land rights for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people took a variety of forms. There were inalienable titles in the Northern Territory and in South Australia, the South Australian legislation being based on the Commonwealth legislation for the Northern Territory. There were deeds of grant in trust in Queensland, and there were reserves and trust lands in Western Australia. There were other forms in Victoria, New South Wales, the ACT and Tasmania. New South Wales, interestingly, has had a land acquisition fund for Aboriginal people for quite some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Mabo decision in 1992 provided the first recognition by the common law of distinctive native title rights. Against that background, I think it must be recognised that this bill contemplates yet another form of indigenous interest in land. Prior to Mabo, there had also been a variety of legislative schemes for the purchase of land for Aborigines. For example, in the 1972 Commonwealth budget the coalition government provided as much as $5 million for the purchase of properties for Aboriginal communities which were off reserves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through the coalition's 1975 policy, the Fraser government supported the Aboriginal Land Commission, which was a body established to purchase land for Aboriginal people where Aboriginal land had been alienated and was not otherwise available. The policy contained an express recognition of `the problems flowing from past dispossession and dispersal of the Aboriginal people and the community's resulting responsibility'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One point which the coalition, in its past administration of Aboriginal affairs, has not overlooked is the important role of state and territory governments. The need to continue to recognise that role was one of the matters which guided the coalition in debate on the bill which became the Native Title Act 1993. There is a continuing need to ensure that the functions of the Commonwealth government and its agencies in the affairs of indigenous people are not to the detriment of the performance by state and territory governments of their responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As explained by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) and the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), the coalition offers conditional support for this bill. The basic objectives are strongly supported, but the manner in which they are sought to be achieved is given qualified support only. In my comments, I want to address principally the scheme of the bill, focusing on the managerial design and the accountability mechanisms. The conclusion I offer is that the design is seriously deficient. In fact, it is so seriously flawed that I believe indigenous people should regard themselves as being sold short yet again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One looks in vain to the text of the bill for a statement of its objectives. There is, however, set out in part A of the explanatory memorandum a statement of specific objectives in the establishment of the land fund and the Indigenous Land Corporation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to enable indigenous people to acquire land and to manage it in a sustainable way to provide economic, social and cultural benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>The bill is supported by the coalition because it recognises the importance of land to indigenous people, that only a small proportion will benefit from the recognition of native title rights and that many indigenous people have been dispossessed of their traditional lands. These reasons for supporting it, which are given by the government as well, strongly suggest that the control of the fund and the corporation should, to the extent practicable, be in the hands of indigenous people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It need hardly be said at the same time that there must be some means of enabling those who administer the fund and those who administer the corporation to be accountable to the people of Australia for the substantial public funds they administer. There should also be some means whereby the particular interests of indigenous people in the distribution and use of those funds should be accounted for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The functions of the corporation are described in the act as being to acquire land for grant to indigenous people or to enable them to acquire land and to carry on the management of land for indigenous people and activities related to that management. Indigenous people live across the continent and in surrounding islands. Therefore, the potential geographical scope of the corporation's activities is huge. The range of activities potentially before the corporation is also huge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me take some examples. The corporation could be asked by the Mowanjum community, which lives near Derby in the north-west of Western Australia, to acquire its traditional lands to enable the community to move back to them. As a member of the coalition shadow ministry task force, I heard from the community in the middle of last year the desire to be able to live on its traditional lands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But those lands are extensive, they are remote from Derby and there is no road to them. If the community moved back, it would find that there is no regular water supply there and there are no houses, schools, hospitals or community facilities. To fulfil their desire would involve construction, in effect, of a township. That would cost millions of dollars. The question would then have to be asked: how would the community sustain itself if it did go back? Many members of the community are unfamiliar with the traditional Aboriginal way of life and many of them have no desire to live that way. Most of them have had little to do with the traditional lands; only the older members of the community remember the traditional way of life on those lands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To take another example, by way of contrast, there are many cattle stations across the north of Australia which are owned and run by Aboriginal people. In some cases these stations are occupied not by one or two families who could expect to get a return from the station sufficient to sustain them but by whole communities. The stations do not and probably, despite the best management effort, could never provide sufficient income to sustain more than one or two families. A station could never provide sufficient income to sustain a whole community. What funds should be provided for upgrading and for management assistance of the operators of a station in those circumstances? We are looking in that situation at something in the nature of permanent income support rather than mere land management assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another type of candidate for assistance from the corporation by way of land acquisition, or even in this case land management, is the indigenous person who lives in an urban area, a country town or a big city. In most cases, his or her need is simply for a roof, a flat or a house. When we take those three simple examples, which are not untypical, we can see that the potential for claims on the fund are enormous and that the funding of $45 million per annum will not go far. It is doubtful that it would go as far as the $5 million per annum given in 1972. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those three cases reveal that the range of competing claims is likely to be large, that the claims are likely to be incomparable and that many of the claims will present intractable problems. In defining a strategy, it has to be taken into account and recognised that the making of decisions pursuant to the strategy to be implemented involves decisions which are essentially political. The management structure should recognise that the decisions to be taken will be political. The management structure in its design should recognise a number of factors that I have already mentioned, such as the desire for self-management by the indigenous people, accountability to the public for the use of public funds and accountability to indigenous people for the distribution of the funds. It should also recognise that the range of competing claims and the intractable problems they present will be huge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the response of the government does not recognise those factors. The corporation is to be run by a board of seven members. Except for the chairperson of ATSIC, who sits ex officio, all are appointed by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. One of the six appointed members must be an ATSIC commissioner and five of the seven members must be persons of indigenous extraction. The principal functions of the board defined under the bill are to develop a national indigenous land strategy, a three- to five-year plan covering matters of the acquisition of land, land management issues and environmental issues relating to indigenous-held land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The board is also required to prepare regional indigenous land strategies dealing with similar issues on a regional basis. In its land acquisition and management activities the board is required to act in accordance with the strategies. One might ask: what self-management is involved? Under the bill, no direct role is envisaged for indigenous people generally in the management and accountability model. The closest involvement of indigenous people generally is in the election of the ATSIC commissioners, who happen to become directors. I do not overlook the fact that the chairperson and four members of the board must be of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander extraction, but we are looking here at management and accountability models. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ATSIC is an elected body representing indigenous people across the continent. It has some role to play. It has not&mdash;as might have been expected had self-management been a true objective&mdash;been given the responsibility of administering the fund and the corporation. ATSIC does not elect the board; it does not approve the national strategy or any regional strategy; and it does not receive an annual report from the board. In fact, its functions are rather limited. They seem to be limited to some aspects of consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the preparation of the national strategy, the corporation must have regard to the desirability of consulting ATSIC about such matters as it considers appropriate&mdash;which is a very weak consultation requirement. Before appointing a director of the corporation, the minister must consult ATSIC, but he does not have to follow any recommendation from ATSIC. The minister has the power to sack a corporation director, but only after first consulting ATSIC. The power to sack is limited to a finding of either misbehaviour, physical incapacity or mental incapacity. At the administrative level ATSIC staff may perform duties on behalf of the corporation by arrangement, and ATSIC's Office of Evaluation and Audit has some audit functions. Therefore, it can be seen that the role of ATSIC is peripheral, not direct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having rejected the managerial model under which accountability is to representatives of indigenous people, it might then be expected that the corporation and its board would be accountable to the people of Australia generally. After all, public funds are involved. That would involve the minister being responsible and accountable to parliament. But that has not happened either. The minister does appoint the board, to the extent that the board comprises the six persons who are not the chairperson of ATSIC; but the board is not under the control of the minister. The minister does not approve the national strategy; the minister does not approve the regional strategies. Again, the extent of the minister's powers is rather limited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister may seek information about the corporation's activities, and the board must give it. On the minister's request, the board must give the minister a copy of the national strategy and the regional strategy. ATSIC keeps accounts and prepares financial statements. The minister's role is limited to determining the form. In this case, it is not the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs; it is the Minister for Finance. The minister must convene annual meetings to discuss the investment policy of the land fund, and the minister may attend such meetings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This minister's role is rather limited also. The accountability of the minister to parliament being limited, it might be thought that parliament would have a more direct role. In fact, parliament has very little role. The minister is required to prepare an annual report about the administration of the land fund, including: receipts, payments out, details of investments, and returns on investment. The report must be laid before parliament within 15 sitting days of the completion of the report. I perceive that that is essentially only a financial report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view the result of this little review is that the design of the managerial model is quite deficient; in fact, it is a muddle. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people do not have control. Instead, there is a board which has an incredibly difficult task but little responsibility to account to anyone. ATSIC is not given any significant responsibility. The minister has limited powers, and parliament has no powers of supervision of any sort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without being able to deal in detail with the matter, another deficiency that is quite significant in my view is that the administration of the fund and the activities of the corporation do not take account of the responsibilities of state governments. This is the case in relation to the registration of interests in land, particularly the non-recognition of interests of potentially innocent third parties dealing without knowledge in interests in land held by indigenous people or those subject to responsibilities under the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is an important bill. It has very significant objectives, which I strongly support. However, the design is deficient. There is no discernible managerial model. There is no provision for accountability on the part of the board of the corporation to anybody in any significant way. The managerial and accountability model should go back to the drawing board. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have great pleasure in speaking on the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill. I must say that I am again concerned by the attitude taken by the opposition in relation to this matter. Honourable members will probably recall the marathon debate on the Mabo legislation that took place here and in the Senate at the end of last year. I had thought, after that debate and after the clear acceptance by the Australian people as a whole of the fact that the Aboriginal people were deserving of major new initiatives in relation to land, that we would have very little controversy over a bill such as this. Instead, again we have had a lot of controversy, especially about the position of the opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to emphasise two things in my speech today. Many members on our side have emphasised the importance of land, but I want to emphasise the relationship between the land and the culture of the Aboriginal people. It has been asserted on a number of occasions&mdash;indeed, by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) yesterday&mdash;that we should be concerned about other aspects of social justice for Aboriginal people, such as housing, education, health and so forth. Indeed we should be concerned. The government has certainly been concerned about those issues over the last few years and has done a lot of work in relation to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think what we fail to perceive is just how tragic the situation of the Aboriginal people was before we started doing something about it and how difficult the task is even now. Imagine a proud collection of societies, because that is essentially what the Aboriginal societies were, with their distinct cultural forms, rich traditions, a host of philosophical beliefs, the complexity of which we still do not fully understand, the whole concept of the Dreamtime, a philosophical approach which in its nature was very spiritual. For the Aboriginal people the very notion of identity was tied up with the land. Their culture and identity were tied up with the concept of the sacredness of the lands on which they lived. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every place had a meaning in the system of things, not merely a meaning in a functional sense but in a broader sense&mdash;almost a religious sense. That is where the concept of sacred sites comes from, which some people have tried to ridicule. Those people do not understand that the Aboriginal culture was based on this general concept of the land and the importance of specific sites. When the white men arrived and decided that they were going to colonise this place, they simply proceeded on a path of cultural destruction&mdash;sometimes even blunt physical destruction. We are still finding out about massacres that occurred and about terrible deeds that were done to Aboriginal people, but essentially the reality is that they were being destroyed both physically and culturally. The cultural destruction was very successful. Many of these cultures were totally destroyed and little remains. Others, fortunately, have remained in some parts of Australia. We are now, as I said earlier, trying to understand the complexity of these cultures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We used direct physical intervention to kill Aboriginal people; we introduced diseases and various forms of cultural destruction. We felt that the best thing to do was to teach them our ways and our belief system, and to totally ignore what they believed in, especially their relationship to the land. Is it a wonder that they have been put in this position? With the exception of the indigenous people of America, I do not think that any people in recent history have been subjected to the same situation. This form of cultural destruction is an historical shame. It is in that context that we have to agree to do whatever we can to restore the position of the Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am amazed at the goings-on of the opposition. About three weeks ago, the Leader of the Opposition said that the opposition would consider the repeal of the Mabo bill. I say to him that a lot of people in this country have worked to achieve the Mabo bill, and it will never be repealed. The opposition may attempt to repeal it, but it will never get the numbers in the upper house and, even if it did, there would be so much public protest against the repeal of that bill that it would never succeed. That was a shameful statement by the Leader of the Opposition. It disappointed many of us because when he became the Leader of the Opposition we were told that the opposition would change its perspective on social justice issues; that it would move from the previous crazy right wing positions adopted over the years by the Liberal Party which led it into the political wilderness; and that it would look at issues concerning human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what do we find? When the first test came up, he went and saw Richard Court in Western Australia&mdash;a reactionary, a man who is not concerned with human rights. I say this openly about him and his positions in relation to Aboriginal people. He ought to look at implementing human rights at the state level in Western Australia with respect to Aboriginal people rather than lecturing the federal government, and he should look at the behaviour of his police forces and other people who are supposed to deliver services to the Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the Leader of the Opposition to come in here and talk about health and other such issues, which are generally delivered through the state governments&mdash;and when all he could do when he went to Western Australia was to agree with Richard Court about the probability of repealing the Mabo bill&mdash;is shameful. The reality is that we were hoping the Liberal Party would adopt positions that were more moderate, more in line with the consensus of the Australian nation. The Australian nation has now come to understand the importance of reconciliation with the Aboriginal people. When I say `the Australian nation' I do not mean everyone of course; I mean the vast majority of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw this recognition just the other day when some diehards attempted to criticise Cathy Freeman&mdash;whose performance at the Commonwealth Games was excellent, as was the performance of our other sports people&mdash;for making a statement about her Aboriginality. What did we have? We had some reactionaries criticising her. The most important thing, as she said on television, was that she was inundated with hundreds and hundreds of messages from well-wishers from all over Australia. All of the major media and major organisations in this country supported her position. That shows that we as a people have shifted in relation to this matter; that we now understand the importance of reconciliation and understand the importance of rights for the Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We come to the situation where the members of the opposition have another opportunity to outline their views. What are they doing this time? After having said two or three weeks ago that they might repeal the Mabo bill&mdash;and because of the goings-on within the Liberal Party and the fact that they have been represented throughout the nation, especially in the media, as moving further to the right following the dismissal of the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson)&mdash;they have decided to tell us that they do actually want to support the land fund to a certain degree, but they have added many clauses and conditions. By the way, we have not seen the full measure of them yet, but we know that they will be clauses and conditions which the government would find difficult to accept or meet and, which the opposition can use as an excuse for rejecting the land fund. What a disgraceful tactic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic situation is that the bill is here as part of the social justice package. There will be further measures announced in due course, but for members of the opposition to say, `Unless you announce some measures that we want, we are going to oppose this bill,' when previously they did not give a damn about any measures is nonsense. This is a very ad hoc and superficial way of trying to unite a disunited party which is divided on this question. We have known about the divisions on this question, but we are saying that the party leaders should stand up and say clearly and unequivocally, `We are supporting this bill because the nation wants it, because the Australian people want it, because the Aboriginal people need it.' Instead of doing that, they are trying to say that other things are more important than land. Other things are not more important than land. Land is not just a question of property in the eyes of the Aboriginal people, in terms of their culture. Land has a much deeper significance, a significance which we are only now starting to understand. We must respect that significance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been asked why, with the passage of the Mabo bill, we need to have these additional measures. The answer is pretty straightforward. It is a very important issue. The answer is that only a small proportion of the Aboriginal people will be able to gain access to land as a result of the Mabo decision and legislation because we have so destroyed the connection between a large number of the Aboriginal people and their earlier ownership of land. We have so undermined it that they will find it difficult to prove their relationship to the land within the meaning of the act. Many of them have been shifted to different places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation provides an opportunity for what? For a corporation to purchase land on behalf of the Aboriginal people to ensure that that land is used so they can re-establish their link to the land, re-establish a basis for their culture and for their tradition. Surely, as the people who destroyed their culture and their link to the land, we have an obligation to enable this to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a very solemn obligation this government is determined to ensure is met. That is not just because of the historical situation; it is also a question of fundamental human rights. It is no good our talking about being a society that believes in social justice and a fair go and then saying, `But, of course, we exempt the Aborigines.' That was the position in this country until there was a referendum to recognise the Aboriginal people. It was not until that referendum in the mid-1970s that we actually recognised them as part of the nation, that we actually recognised them as human beings having rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to that time, only a handful of Aborigines were actually given citizenship in Australia. One of them was the great artist Albert Namatjira&mdash;one of the great Aboriginals. When he was given citizenship, some people wanted to take it away. Back then we selected a very small number of Aboriginal people and said, `You're special, we'll give you citizenship, but we don't recognise the rest of you.' In 1958, after Albert Namatjira was given that citizenship, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northern Territory News</EMPHASIS>&mdash;a paper that unfortunately still remains hostile to Aboriginal people&mdash;reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important now not only for Namatjira that there be some acceptance of the lessons glaring from the shamble of the artist's rise and fall that there be a little public understanding of the massive problem besetting the authorities in the full rights program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It must be clear that it was a mistake to give Namatjira his citizenship passport despite the fact that he proved he could walk with kings, earn more than most white people and had dignity and ability.</PARA>
<PARA>Can honourable members believe that?  That is what the newspaper said in 1958. The explanation it gave was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Surely an essential measure of whether a native should get full rights must be his proven ability to bring up his family to the acceptable white standards. This was not the case with Namatjira and this very fact probably contributed more to his downfall than anything else.</PARA>
<PARA>We have a lot to answer for in the treatment of Aboriginal people in the last 200 years or more. In the last few years, especially last year with the Mabo legislation, we have carried out dramatic measures for achieving reconciliation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it came to Mabo, a piece of legislation symbolically as important as anything we have done for who knows how long, the rednecks won the day. As a consequence, the coalition was marginalised and the death knell was sounded for the former leader, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson). I remember watching the member for Wentworth deliver his Mabo speech and turning to my learned colleague the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) and saying that was the end of Hewson. It was to be true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the budget debates, the opposition pounced on the criticism of the President of the ACTU of the regressive tax measures in the budget. `I will not defend the indefensible' became a common jibe in the House. Yet when it came to Mabo, the coalition was the epitome of a team without a coach and the leader was there attempting to defend the indefensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Aboriginal land fund will not rectify the problems of 200 years of dispersion, displacement and dispossession. Discussions with the Victorian Aboriginal community suggests that the bill is supported by Aboriginal groups in Victoria. It is pointed out, however, that Victorian Aboriginal people have special needs and that the corporation should have the resources to research these needs and apply the land acquisition funds according to these needs. They wish to ensure that every Victorian clan, tribe or nation has a base which can support the cultural, social and economic aspirations of that clan, tribe or nation. They say these bases should conform, as much as possible, to clan areas prior to colonisation. This is in contrast to the coalition response. The Victorian Aboriginal community's approach springs from notions of self-determination and cultural identity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has, in effect, challenged the thrust of the land fund. What the coalition seeks to do is inflict yet another round of paternalism on Aboriginal people. The coalition refuses to grasp the fact that land is central to the aspirations of Aboriginal people. Member after member has documented the health, housing and education problems which afflict Aboriginal communities throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), despite his flowery approach to the issue, is at least partially right when he says that constructing a new, or adding to an existing, bureaucracy is not the way to go. The problem with the member for Kalgoorlie is that he always knows a bloke who knows a bloke who reckons there is something wrong with whatever policy on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander matters comes out of Canberra. At the end of the member for Kalgoorlie's speech I am still not sure what ought to be done. I do not think he is sure about what ought to be done. At one point it sounded as though 4,000 head of breeders were going to solve 200 years of dispossession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Kalgoorlie wants it both ways. If 36 Aboriginals are appointed to the Prime Minister's office, they serve nothing but self-interest and the Aboriginal industry, whatever that Aboriginal industry happens to mean. If Aboriginals are not appointed or do not get to have their say, it is because we do not want to listen. The member for Kalgoorlie says that he is the only person who does listen. He says Aboriginal people tell him that they want to be part of the mainstream, that they want to be part of Australia and that they do not want anything other Australians do not get. Just who the person is or who the people are who tell him this, we are never quite sure. Neither are we sure about what the moral of the story is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, if we accept the premise that Aboriginal people want to be part of the mainstream, then we would obviously have to rectify the great inequities that exist between black and white Australians. If we accept the premise that Aboriginal people do not want anything other Australians do not get, does that preclude rectifying dispossession? What is it that Aboriginal people get as a handout? Is massive unemployment a handout? Is ill health a handout? When I was in Papunya some time ago, the Aboriginal representatives that I met there were far from happy about the Northern Territory government and the appalling conditions they were living under. They did not want handouts; they wanted power and justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of resolving the problems that 200 years of dispossession created is obviously complex. It is true that they will not be overcome by the kind of paternalism that characterised the cultural imperialism of the missionary days. What is just as true is that they will not be overcome by the kinds of attitudes that dominate coalition thinking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, how do we determine in advance with any certainty how land purchases will advance the health, housing or educational needs of Aboriginal communities? Just as importantly, why should we? Does not making such demands smack of the very paternalism that members of the coalition have criticised in one speech after another? The only time I have heard the coalition&mdash;with a couple of notable exceptions&mdash;talk about Aboriginal health, housing and education has been when it has seen the opportunity to score a political point. It does not seem to me that it is an issue around which the coalition is galvanised in a positive way. Again, there are some exceptions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the rednecks are not favourably disposed towards Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, no matter what they say. A spade is a spade. This is the problem with the proposed amendments. Commonsense tells us that we have to question the bona fides of the Leader of the Opposition. Some of the lines in his speech are pearlers. This one, quoted by Mark Baker in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age </EMPHASIS>this morning, deserves a mention:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To accept failure is to accept the premature death, imprisonment and impoverishment of a proud and ancient people.</PARA>
<PARA>It sounded like he was talking about the noble savage. What a line from the party which would have nothing do with and nothing to say about the Mabo legislation, that sat back and refused to even engage in a discussion about the legitimacy of that bill. This from an opposition which had its nose out of joint because Cathy Freeman carried the Aboriginal flag at the  Commonwealth Games. `What an insult to the Queen and the great Commonwealth that we are a part of,' they cried. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition usually has two escape routes. `It is very important that money does not end up in the hands of white bureaucrats or get lost in the bureaucracy,' they say. `It must be accountable to the Australian people,' they say. They never, however, adopt the same principles in relation to support for business in the form of tax concessions and the like. We did not hear them squealing in the 1980s when those tycoons were throwing money away like it was going out of style. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second escape route is via their opposition to the so-called guilt industry. `I am not guilty. I do not see any point in feeling guilty about what has happened,' they say. It is just another smokescreen. Aboriginal reconciliation has nothing to do with guilt. It is not derived from a feeling of guilt. Rather, it has everything to do with rectifying past wrongs and acknowledging that indigenous people, `those proud and ancient people', as described by the Leader of the Opposition, have suffered some major injustices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me to a specific problem of Aboriginal rights in Victoria and one that members of this House might like to think about in the context of Mabo and the Aboriginal land fund. It relates to a school which stands on a plot of land in Preston. Given the coalition's concern for the role of education in the land fund bill, honourable members might like to focus on what has happened at that school. The Kennett government, as some members would be aware, closed the school. It is a school with a significant Aboriginal population and an Aboriginal program that was praised by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Kennett marched in and closed the school, but the people fought on. The equal opportunity tribunal found that the closure was an act of racial discrimination. The government appealed the decision in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court found in favour of the rebel school. In essence, the closure of the school was an act of racial discrimination. I would like the honourable member for Calwell to take this on board. The closure of Northland secondary school was an act of racial discrimination. That is what the equal opportunity tribunal said and that is what the Supreme Court of Victoria said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Calwell has admonished the opposition for its failure to accept new initiatives such as the ATSIC land bill. But if we are going to admonish the opposition, if we are going to criticise the rednecks in the opposition, then we need to focus squarely on what has happened at the Northland secondary college and what has happened at the federal level. I am sure the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) would agree with me that something should be done at that school. We need to ask why an act of dispossession in Preston, in the seat of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), has been able to proceed without a single word mentioned in this House. I asked a question of the Prime Minister some time ago, and all he could say was, `We do not have the money.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the member for Calwell, who speaks out on social justice, why nothing has been done. This week, the Minister  for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) asked the coalition if she could see the colour of its money when she was questioned over funds allocated to an Aboriginal health service in Central Australia. I ask the Minister for Human Services and Health if we can see the colour of the government's money on this question of dispossession in Preston at Northland secondary college. Gary Foley put it this way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The federal government had abandoned its responsibility to protect the interests of the significant portion of the Aboriginal community adversely affected by the state decision to close Northland. Under constitutional powers gained after the 1967 referendum the federal government had the power to intervene to resolve the Northland dispute. Instead, for two years the Labor government in Canberra had not only run away from their clear obligations on the Northland issue but they had also acted on numerous occasions to undermine and sabotage the Northland community struggle to save their school.</PARA>
<PARA>You can disagree with Gary Foley's sentiments and some of the facts if you like, but a significant number of facts are verifiable. He went on to say this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The experience of past and present Northland students (who are in the category defined by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody as being those most in danger of dying abnormally in custody) will demonstrate the vast difference between the PR hype of federal and state governments and the reality on the streets for koori youth.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minster for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) says, in response to Gary Foley:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have not hesitated to give my sustained public and private support to Northland. As you know damn well, however, I have no authority to provide funding. Aboriginal education issues are totally outside my ministerial control.</PARA>
<PARA>Someone has to stand up and say, `Yes, I have the responsibility to do something about an act of dispossession that occurred in Preston two years ago&mdash;not 200 years ago, two years ago. It does not have anything to do with the Dreamtime. It has something to do with land. It has something to do with education. It has something to do with health. The land bill is a step forward, and a good step forward. The opposition from the coalition is silly opposition because it comes from an opposition that has no grasp of the big picture, as the Prime Minister puts it. But, on the other hand, the federal government cannot just trot out the cliches and the platitudes about reconciliation and dispossession unless when it is faced with a specific act of dispossession it acts to do something about it. This is an act of dispossession. I call on the federal government to do something and do something quickly. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Government has always recognised that despite its historic significance, the Mabo decision gives little more than a sense of justice to those Aboriginal communities whose native title has been extinguished or lost without consultation, negotiation or compensation. Their dispossession has been total, their loss has been complete.</PARA>
<PARA>He also went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While these communities remain dispossessed of land, their economic marginalisation and their sense of injury continue. This dispossession has led to the social and economic marginalisation which the government is intending to address through a package of social justice measures, of which the Land Fund will be the major financial component.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government remains committed to working with ATSIC and other indigenous representatives to remedy indigenous dispossession.</PARA>
<PARA>The ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill is another step along that path. It is a great tragedy that the opposition has again sought to play politics with this issue. It is very interesting that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) could go to the Northern Territory in recent times and get it so wrong. He has condemned himself from his own mouth and by his own actions, which were there for the community to see. Reconciliation has been on the agenda since the High Court decision in June 1992. These matters have been in the public domain since that time, yet a leader of a major political party went to the Northern Territory and, frankly, did not know which way was up when it came to his own party's policy, his own views and where he was taking the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same can be said of the opposition's attitude to this bill before the parliament. One minute the opposition opposes the bill and the next minute, to appease the moderate sections of the party, we have the situation where it will have some amendments but we do know what those amendments are and it says to us, `We are not going to show them to you now, but you will see them. If you do not accept the amendments we are going to oppose the bill.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have only to look at the way the Leader of the Opposition selected his shadow ministry to see how he punished the moderates in his party who had actually privately supported the government's initial Mabo legislation. The previous shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), was dumped from the shadow ministry. The previous shadow Aboriginal affairs minister, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), was also dumped from the ministry. The honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) was demoted within the ministry, and the current shadow spokesperson for Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), was transferred from the environment portfolio to the Aboriginal affairs portfolio and that was not seen as a promotion. We have only to look at that situation to see where the Leader of the Opposition rates Aboriginal affairs on the opposition's agenda. He does not rate it very highly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the electorate, intelligent as it is, has seen the Leader of the Opposition for what he is. He is an absolute lightweight, without policies and without substance&mdash;a policy free zone. This perception results from his actions. The remarkable thing about the performance of the opposition is that criticism of it has not come about because of things said by members of the government. The opposition's performance in relation to the land fund will be further testimony to how shallow it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Previous conservative leaders have had a reasonable approach to this issue. The 1967 referendum was conducted by a conservative government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was fortunate in the July adjournment to be able to go to Geneva and sit in on a conference of a working group on indigenous people. It is formulating a statement in relation to indigenous people around the world. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) was there. I listened to what was happening in America, Canada and New Zealand and it became obvious that, as far as the world is concerned, Australia is at the forefront. It is at the forefront in formulating the declaration of rights. It is at the forefront with regard to cajoling, and talking to, other countries to come to terms with the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition came into this parliament yesterday and gave what I could only describe as the most hypocritical speech I have heard in my short time in this place. One would think, having listened to him, that the opposition is the repository of all wisdom and that its recent record outshone our record. What is the opposition's recent record? The former Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), described the day the Mabo legislation passed this parliament as a day of shame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, the current Leader of the Opposition's conduct is no better. Indeed, it is worse. It is worse because he is perpetrating a deception. At least the honourable member for Wentworth had the decency to tell it as he saw it. The problem with the current Leader of the Opposition is that it depends who he is talking to. He tells people what they want to hear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed that the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary) talked about the revelation that the Leader of the Opposition when a backbencher addressed the League of Rights. The Leader of the Opposition needs to be judged on that. People can judge him on whether or not he addressed the League of Rights. On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program on 7 August, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will never, never find me tolerating in any shape or form any type of racism at all, ever, ever. If I've been on a platform, if I've been on platforms . . . I'm sure I've been on platforms where there have been people from the League of Rights around, but I never given any support to the League of Rights.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is in direct contrast to what he is currently saying and contradicts the evidence coming to the fore. It is one thing to say, `I have been on a platform where there might have been people from the League of Rights.' Did he or did he not address a League of Rights meeting? He needs to come clean on that. That is why this legislation is significant. Even if the opposition's amendments are rejected by the government, or if some of them are picked up, opposition members need to support the legislation. If they do not, they will be seen as the hypocrites I think they are. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Mick Dodson, stated the position eloquently when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For us land has a spiritual, cultural, political and economic value. It supports our identity, our spirit, our social relations, our integrity and our survival. Land is the source of our physical and spiritual sustenance. Removed from our land we are removed from ourselves.</PARA>
<PARA>That is why this legislation is important. Part A of the explanatory memorandum at page 1 basically sets out the objectives of this legislation which I think are worth restating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation is part of the Commonwealth's overall response to the High Court's historic Mabo decision and complements the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Native Title Act 1993</EMPHASIS>. As most indigenous Australians have been dispossessed of their lands, they have been prevented from meeting the criteria laid down in Mabo which requires a continuing connection with land or waters. This legislation represents a further significant step in reversing the process of dispossession which has been ongoing for over 200 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth's specific objectives in establishing the Land Fund and the Indigenous Land Corporation are to enable indigenous people to acquire land and to manage it in a sustainable way to provide economic, social and cultural benefits. The focus on land management extends to other indigenous-owned land, as well as that acquired by the Indigenous Land Corporation. The establishment of a self-sustaining capital fund will provide a secure and ongoing source of funds to the Indigenous Land Corporation for expenditure on land acquisition and management. It is intended that the Corporation operate on the basis of regionally based strategies and involve regional representative interests. It will have the ability to operate on a commercial basis.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the import of the bill before the House today. What the Prime Minister said in his second reading speech encapsulates what we as a government are all about, and it is worth repeating. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is enormous symbolic value in the Mabo decision and the subsequent legislation. For the first time in our history, the inherent rights of indigenous Australians have been recognised and given statutory protection. These developments indicate that as a nation we have had the collective courage and wisdom to acknowledge the violence and destruction done to indigenous Australians and their culture since European  occupation. They signal that as a nation we are willing to accept our responsibility to work towards a new relationship. Much has been achieved, but justice has not yet been done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Justice has not been done because the majority of Australia's indigenous people live on the margins of economic, social and cultural life in this country. We may ask how this can be so in a country with one of the highest standards of living in the world, a country which prides itself on giving everyone a fair go. It is so, Mr Acting Speaker, because the vast majority of indigenous Australians have been dispossessed, either in whole or part, of that which is most precious to their sense of history and spirituality, that most essential component of their heritage&mdash;their land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contemporary western culture tends to view land as something of a commodity, something which may enrich us, but not something which goes to the essence of our culture. It is difficult for non-indigenous Australians to understand what Australia's indigenous people feel about the loss of their land. It is difficult, therefore, to comprehend the extent of their dispossession. Yet it should not be too difficult for us to comprehend. It should surely not be difficult for Australians who have always placed such a value on owning a bit of Australia, the people who have taken much of their literary and artistic inspiration from the bush and who still find their greatest comfort in the natural landscape of Australia in the great outdoors. The land has a cultural and spiritual significance for all Australians and we all can surely come to an understanding of what total and uncompensated dispossession meant. We must try to comprehend it. Unless we understand the importance of land to indigenous peoples, we cannot come to terms with the extent of the loss.</PARA>
<PARA>That is why this is substantial legislation; it is historic legislation; it is legislation that deserves bipartisan support. I could understand if the Leader of the Opposition and members of the opposition parties were to stand up in the parliament and say, `Look, you don't go far enough as a government. We believe that we have amendments that can enhance and enrich the bill which you've placed before the parliament.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those instances, the opposition could put the amendments and, in the end, if the amendments were defeated, it could support the legislation. That would be the most reasonable course of action for the opposition to take if it were at all serious, but the reverse is happening. It is a cop-out; it is a two bob each way approach to hide the real  approach of the leadership of the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The leadership of the opposition has no time for Aboriginal and indigenous Australians and it wants to give them nothing. It has a paternalistic approach. The opposition should say, `We have these amendments that we think can improve the bill. If you don't accept them, we'll still vote for the bill.' But, no, the opposite is occurring. The opposition is saying, `If you don't accept these amendments, we'll vote against the bill.' Its real intention&mdash;and its performance since the High Court brought down its Mabo decision is indicative of this&mdash;is to give indigenous Australians nothing and to fight them every inch of the way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court brought down its Mabo decision in June 1992. What would have happened if it were BHP or another large corporation which supports the conservative parties that had a victory in the High Court? The Liberal and National parties would not have said, `Let's take away those rights that the High Court has given them. Let's wind them back.' They would have said, `We've got to support the High Court on this. The rule of law needs to be preserved and the High Court needs to be supported.' But that is not the opposition's position with respect to Mabo, and one needs to ask why. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great tragedy is that the leadership of the opposition does not understand. I am not saying that there are not members of the conservative parties who are genuinely interested. When the honourable member for Chisholm was the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, he made an enormous contribution to our society and he assisted in the process of reconciliation. He was a constructive shadow minister who had a genuine commitment to indigenous Australians. But where is he in the pecking order now? What does that tell you about the conservative parties?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have a problem with the opposition having a particular policy if it can be nailed down to it. That is the problem with the current Leader of the Opposition. It is significant that his visit to the Northern Territory exposed him to the electorate at large for what he was. Since then, the talkback programs and the opinion polls have confirmed that the electorate will not cop him and these sorts of policies. I urge members of the opposition to further consider their attitude to this bill and to put pressure on the Leader of the Opposition and his executive to support the bill, which goes a long way to assisting the dispossession of indigenous Australians, if the opposition's amendments are not accepted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill goes some way to embodying important concepts into legislation. As I said earlier, whilst the High Court judgment afforded recognition of native title as applying uniquely to Australia's indigenous people, it also recognised that only indigenous people possessed the particular relationship with land called native title and its attendant rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that there has been consultation and negotiation on this bill. The right to control decisions over how resources are utilised for the wellbeing of indigenous Australians is enshrined in this legislation. It is in line with principles of self-determination.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This massive Aboriginal industry almost entirely funded by federal and state governments has sought to distort the real situation confronting Australian Aborigines and to rewrite history to their own advantage. Anyone who dares question their actions and their ruthless exercise of power is immediately branded a racist or a redneck. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Aboriginal industry displays no tolerance to alternative views in the community or even to minority groups of Aborigines. Real power in the Aboriginal industry is exercised by a few tribal groups to the exclusion of others, and nepotism is rife. There is an extraordinary concentration of grants and funding to relations of those who are in power. It is these same groups that dominate ATSIC, advise ministers and occupy positions in the Aboriginal bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most full-blood Aborigines, particular those living closest to their old ways, are shy and ill equipped to have their views heard, let alone be heeded by the Aboriginal industry. There have, therefore, been numerous cases where land rights have been granted to the group with the political power and not to those Aborigines with the most genuine claims on the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those with the political power fund their own supporters, often dispossessing their fellow Aborigines who have the strongest claim.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it amazing and deplorable that the government and the community at large have not been more questioning of the administration of Aboriginal affairs in this country. It seems that even the most extraordinary tales peddled by the Aboriginal industry are allowed to go unquestioned until eventually they become a part of the politically correct position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the same person claims to be a tribal leader and makes land claims in more than one state, surely some questions should be asked about his legitimacy. In my own electorate Mr John Lee Jones, who has appeared on the scene since the Fitzgerald inquiry into the Great Sandy Region, has suggested that there should be a role for Aboriginals in the management of the region. This same Mr Jones claims to be an elder of three different tribes and is laying claim to much of south-east Queensland. Now this same man is claiming $40 million in rewards from the Victorian government, allegedly for the role his forefathers played in the capture of the Kelly Gang. People like Mr Jones are generously endowed with Aboriginal industry funds and organisations with which he is associated have received tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the Aboriginal industry which is seeking to foster the guilt syndrome as a basis for Aboriginal assistance. It is this massive government funded bureaucracy which is promoting the rewriting of our national history to describe European settlement of this country as an invasion. These are the people who want treaties between black and white, and United Nations declarations to grant them self-government and to establish an independent nation within a nation on our continent. Support for all these sorts of causes is being gently massaged into community attitudes, the education curriculum and, of course, the politically correct agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The clear facts are, however, that none of these issues will do anything to address the real disadvantage of the Aboriginal people. Blaming others for the problems will not help them go away. A treaty or international declaration will not cure alcoholism nor stem the spread of AIDS. Creating a separate country within Australia will not extend life expectancy nor improve literacy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These issues are being given undue prominence over the matters which really count because some people in the Aboriginal industry are there just for the exercise of raw political power. This seems to especially be the case for the white lawyers and so-called expert advisers who swarm around every Aboriginal issue. Unfortunately, the federal Labor government has become very much a part of, and has indeed fostered, this distorted view of what will provide real benefits to Aboriginal people. The government seems to devote little time or effort into positive programs to improve Aboriginal health, housing, education and social needs. There is often touching rhetoric but little action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the dying days before his departure from the government, former Minister for Health Graham Richardson went to the Northern Territory and committed the government to an extra $800 million for Aboriginal health care. That was an impressive sounding number and I, like many others, welcomed this professed new found commitment by the government to address Aboriginal health issues. Of course, by the time it came to the budget the $800 million had been whittled down to $500 million spread over five years. But worse was yet to come: $414 million of that money was already committed in continuing projects. In reality, in spite of all the grandiose and heart-warming promises, the government was providing just $17 million a year in new money, and only a paltry $5.25 million of that is to go to primary health care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As usual, the Aboriginal industry was largely silent on this double-cross by the government on the allocation of resources and what I would have thought should be the crucial area of concern for all those people who have the welfare of Aborigines truly at heart. A similar story could be told about the government's efforts in education and training, or housing and community services. The real levels of government achievement have indeed been paltry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's entire Aboriginal affairs policy seems to be built around the myth that the granting of large areas of land to Aboriginal groups will provide a magic and instant solution to the social and economic problems of Australian Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of land rights has been grossly overstated as a solution to the issues of Aboriginal degradation. The case has been exaggerated so often that even some community leaders and members of this House seem to be accepting the magic pudding qualities of the granting of land. Over recent years very large areas of land have been made available to the Aboriginal people in various forms of title. Aborigines, who comprise less than two per cent of the Australian population, already have ownership of more than 16 per cent of the national land mass, including 48 per cent of the Northern Territory. Some of this land has been held by Aborigines for several generations, so it is possible to test the academic theory that land ownership will resolve Aboriginal health, education and social problems. Even the most superficial visit to areas where Aboriginals have title to the land will provide ample evidence that there has been little, if any, improvement in the living conditions of the landowners. In most instances their circumstances have become even worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A study into health issues in the Northern Territory demonstrated quite conclusively that those Aborigines living on land where they had the title had poorer health standards than other Aborigines and, indeed, the majority of Australians. The study showed that the people of east Arnhem Land had a mortality rate for respiratory diseases which was 12 times that of other Australians and that for infectious diseases it was 100 times. These figures are worse than those in areas where the Aborigines do not have title to their land and far worse than the averages applying in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the Aboriginal communities where social degradation and disgraceful living standards are at their worst are those which have been owned by Aboriginal people for extended periods. Buildings, housing and facilities have often been destroyed; education and other services have been hampered or stalled. Alcoholism and violence are the norm. Family relationships and tribal discipline are in tatters. There is little employment and, for most, no hope or optimism for the future. No matter how much extra land is acquired for Aborigines, the problem will not be resolved, because title to land is not the cure-all key that warm-hearted academics may wish to think it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having made that critical&mdash;and, I believe, indisputable&mdash;point, let me hasten to add that I do not dispute the view that land ownership is important to Aborigines. Most Aborigines do love the land and have a strong attachment to it. But so do other people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is soul destroying and utterly devastating to a family farm when drought and other circumstances force the family to leave the land that they have tended and cared for over three or four generations. For that farmer, too, the land is his life; if he must leave the property, a part of him dies. Try persuading an ageing mother to leave her home and garden to go to a nursing home in her latter years or resuming a row of houses for a new road. These people, too, have a healthy and justifiable affinity with their properties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is simply a nonsense to suggest that Aborigines living hundreds of miles away have a greater affinity for a parcel of land that they have never seen than the family members who have lived there all their lives and perhaps inherited from their forefathers. I do not know whether any Aborigine has ever crossed the farm which has been my home all my life, but I do not accept that there would be anyone with a closer affinity to that land than my family and me. And that is true for others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard the previous speaker quote the eloquent words of an Aborigine describing the meaning of land to him. I will not repeat those words, but I am more than happy to ascribe to those words as an adequate description of the way I feel about the land on which I and my family have lived for four generations. I emphasise that I am not against the ownership of land by Aborigines. Ownership should be encouraged. I would even support the availability of public funding to assist in land purchases on a fair and equitable basis. Instead of the sort of land fund that is being developed in the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill, perhaps it would have been better to establish some kind of financial facility like the old agricultural banks which would enable Aborigines to acquire land on commercial terms in the same way that farmers were assisted in bygone eras. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, most of the land theoretically owned by Aborigines in Australia is in fact held by trusts and corporations. There is not the same feeling of personal association and ownership which would apply if the title to the land was in the name of individual Aborigines. I have no doubt that individual ownership rather than corporate title would provide real benefits to Aborigines and a real incentive to achieve things for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If an individual Aborigine and his family thought that they as distinct from anyone else in the world had ownership and responsibility for a particular parcel of land, I have no doubt that they would soon acquire the motivation and management skills to successfully manage it for their own benefit and for the benefit of the nation. In reality, very few Aborigines are actually choosing to live on the areas of land that have already been provided. Very few have chosen to abandon the comforts of a modern lifestyle to return to the old ways of the bush. Like others who have been exposed to a Western lifestyle, they want a choice of television channels, the opportunity to see their football team in action, and access to the facilities and services of an urban lifestyle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only rarely is the land which has been acquired put to productive use. Occasionally, public attention is focused on a new venture&mdash;a cattle station, a crocodile farm, a tourist development or some other proposal&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>but, sadly, the majority of these projects last for only a short time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because they are held in corporate ownership, there is the view that they will be funded with an inexhaustible supply of taxpayers' money, and there is no responsibility felt to ensure that the projects succeed. Individual ownership would guarantee responsibility and a greater prospect of success. Greater land holdings, therefore, are not the key to an improved lifestyle and to better understanding and goodwill between black and white. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not support the type of land fund being proposed by Labor in this legislation. This land fund perpetuates the dangerous myth that the more land provided to Aborigines the smaller their problems.

If it were provided to individuals, there could be that genuine feeling of association and commitment to develop the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also alarmed at the suggestion that this land should be purchased in country areas alone.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I crave your indulgence. My sore throat may give me some problems, but I certainly will not have a problem in dealing with the opposition. On 1 September 1993, in the intense time leading up to the Mabo native title legislation, I asked the House this series of questions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How will history judge us? Will history conclude that we were tried and found wanting? Will we be diminished in the eyes of our children and their children because we placed petty, immediate self-interest ahead of a higher moral imperative? Will our standing in the international world be irretrievably damaged?</PARA>
<PARA>I am glad to say that history will prove that this government was able to grasp the nettle and deal with this issue. But I fear that history will judge the Liberal Party and the National Party, including my colleague the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), very severely indeed. While it may be helpful to him to pander to racism and a redneck attitude in his electorate, I believe it is very concerning that the National Party and the Liberal Party are failing to look a little higher than immediate and parochial self-interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The honourable member for Wide Bay commented on the rewriting of history. I quote some comments I made in my speech on native title on 24 November 1993 regarding the history of issues surrounding native title:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1837 a select committee of the House of Commons found&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is 1837, not 1994. I continue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the formation of these settlements it does not appear that the territorial rights of the natives were considered . . . the land has been taken from them without the assertion of any other title than that of superior force.</PARA>
<PARA>In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aboriginal Law Bulletin</EMPHASIS>, No. 29 of 1987, Henry Reynolds quotes Governor Gawler, who wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From time immemorial they&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the Aborigines&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">had distinct, defined and absolute rights of proprietary and hereditary possession.</PARA>
<PARA>This is not something that the Labor government dreamed up. We looked at the history of this country. Indeed, we now have some members of the opposition admitting that dispossession did occur. So we have dragged opposition members to the point where they have finally admitted that the dispossession was real and that the invasion did occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But now, having seen the debacle over the native title legislation, we are really seeing this whole process revisited. The opposition's response to the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994 really appears to me to be a re-run of that whole debate. We have effectively seen the opposition cobbling together a response based on the leadership crisis inside the party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until very recently, there was total opposition to the land fund bill. I will quote some press comments from the current shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. On 16 June, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) said this in answer to a question about the coalition's official position:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition's official position is to oppose the Land Fund."</PARA>

<PARA>As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said the other day, we have had the virus of the leadership divisions visiting the new leadership in the Liberal Party. We have had the debacle of the new Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer). Wherever he is, he says what he thinks people want to hear. When he was in Western Australia, faced with the Court government and the conservative elements in that state, he said, `Well, we'll repeal the Native Title Act if necessary'. When he was in the Northern Territory, he discovered that he was tired and emotional.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On this occasion, the honourable member for O'Connor is following me. This is a turn-up for the books. It is usually the other way around. The Leader of the Opposition found himself back in Canberra with half his backbench in insurrection. So, to attempt to pull together the moderates and deal with the conservative hardliners, he came up with a response to this bill. I quote the Prime Minister's comments at a doorstop interview yesterday which I think were incredibly apt:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . He is putting up a set of sham amendments, weasel words . . . Because fundamental to his objection is the same fundamental objection the Liberal Party has had all along . . . they don't want Aboriginal and Islander people to have access to land.

<PARA>What did the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Kernot) say? She said what I thought when I was listening to the speech of the opposition leader. She referred to it as a Clayton's land fund&mdash;that is, the sort of land fund you have when you are not having a land fund. The Leader of the Australian Democrats said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition seem to want a "Clayton's" Land Fund&mdash;a land fund you have as long as it's not spent on land. This is incredibly disappointing and confirms the dominance of the conservatives over the moderates within the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA>More particularly, she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Their position amounts to gutting the Fund.</PARA>
<PARA>It is very concerning that the Liberal Party cannot seem to get its act together. We have asked for a bipartisan approach. It is saying, `We'll have one, but only if you turn the bill on its head and do not make it a land fund. Make it anything but a land fund.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very unfortunate to hear the honourable member for Wide Bay talk about his commitment to the land. I appreciate that comment. I understand that non-indigenous Australians have commitments to the country, to their own backyard and their own piece of property, but it has to be understood that the sort of connection that Aboriginal people have to their land is very much a different matter. It has a significance that is more than 200 years old; it is thousands of years old. It is not broken simply because we dispossessed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, drove them away, committed genocide and marginalised them into the present predicament which many of them are experiencing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely crucial to the reconciliation process that we deal with this issue. I refer once again to the Prime Minister's speech yesterday. I believe that the Labor government has a right to be proud of its achievement in this area. The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the first time in our history, the inherent rights of indigenous Australians have been recognised and given statutory protection. These developments indicate that as a nation we have had the collective courage and wisdom to acknowledge the violence and destruction done to indigenous Australians and their culture since European occupation. They signal that as a nation we are willing to accept our responsibility to work towards a new relationship.</PARA>
<PARA>But this will require that we also deal with those issues that will not be dealt with under native title. This land acquisition fund bill relates to the majority of Aboriginal people who will not be able to seek redress under the native title legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken to many individuals and groups in the community. I am afraid that even some members of my own family have never met an Aboriginal person. They have never sat down and talked to an Aboriginal person, but they have picked up on the myths and bigoted views that are sometimes referred to in the press, accounts of which were given by the honourable member for Wide Bay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is a broader view, and I think it is very important to remind ourselves that what caused the new opposition leader to end his honeymoon with a thud was the issue of Aboriginal land rights. If it were true that the majority of Australians were absolutely and irrevocably opposed to social justice for Aboriginal people, I do not think this would have been the issue which caused this incredible drop in the opinion polls. Both this and the Cathy Freeman incident at the Commonwealth Games indicate that the majority of decent Australians are becoming increasingly aware that these issues must be responded to and must be addressed. I take this opportunity to congratulate Cathy on her performance, behaviour and commitment to the Aboriginal flag and what it has meant symbolically, not only to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people but to all Australians. I refer to correspondence from the Australian Council of Trade Unions, dated 30 August. Point 5 of the letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is expected that the Bill will pass Parliament by the end of 1994 to set up the National Land Fund and allow commencement of the new Indigenous Land Corporation on the 1st January 1995.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want to place on record my acknowledgment of the hard work, support and commitment of trade unions across this country to issues of social justice for Aboriginal people. I will return to the issue of the meaning of land to Aboriginal people. I want to quote from a submission, dated 5 April 1994, to the Shoalwater Bay commission of inquiry&mdash;I am delighted that, as we speak, it is being processed through cabinet&mdash;from the Darumbal-Moolar Murree Aboriginal Corporation for Land and Culture:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our relationship with this area goes back a long way, for possibly many thousands of years, through many generations of our families, we value this area for the long traditional association we've had with it. We see that for a short term, a couple of generations, our relationship with this area has been interrupted, but it's now time to get back and re-establish our relationship with this area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's been said more than once that Aboriginal culture in this area has been decimated almost to the point of extinction, we don't believe this to be true, we agree that much has been lost but still we've retained knowledge and understanding of language, spirituality, kinship relationships, totems and so on, that which we value greatly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We seek to regenerate and revitalise our culture, we want our people to again value, respect and practise it, also to fulfil their obligations to teach and pass it on to their children. Of course it can be said that we've lost too much, and that what is lost is lost forever. We believe that at the basis of any social or cultural group is the Family and basic family values, we feel that we have sustained our family and kinship relationships, as well as our appreciation for our family values. While we have this we have the very basis of our culture.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We also have a basic understanding and appreciation of our spirituality, an understanding and appreciation that will strengthen and improve if we're given the opportunity to get back into our country</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .       . . .      . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To us, "Wilderness" is a concept that has been created by white people for their own benefit, to us there's no such thing. These are our traditional Darumbal Homelands, our identities are here, we're part of this country, we belong here. This country will improve and prosper under our care and guidance. We have more of an appreciation of the conservation and preservation of this area than anyone, we also understand our obligation to our forefathers, ourselves, and our children to manage and maintain this area. This is our home and we respect it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As has been stated during this Inquiry, Aboriginal people have many social problems to deal with, we believe that many of these problems are a direct result of cultural and social breakdown, brought about by loss of identity, in turn brought about by loss of land. Granting us access to land will afford us the opportunity to reassert our identity, our spirituality, and our culture. The result, we hope, will be an improvement in self-esteem, which unfortunately at times is lacking. We don't expect it will solve all our problems immediately, but it will certainly improve our present situation.</PARA>
<PARA>These are not my words, the words of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), university lecturers or researchers; these are the words of the Hatfield family of Rockhampton. Doug Hatfield has been a paraplegic since a diving accident many years ago. The opportunity that was afforded to these descendants and elders of the Darumbal people in the Rockhampton region by the Shoalwater Bay inquiry has been of unique importance to this group. It has meant an enormous amount to these people that their submission was accepted, that they were acknowledged and that the Prime Minister met them during his recent visit to Rockhampton. I believe it is very important that the inquiry's recommendations included a very positive response to the Darumbal people's call to have access to the Shoalwater Bay area so that they can have the opportunity to maintain their links to the past. </PARA>

As a young man, in his early married life&mdash;having had absolutely nothing to do with politics&mdash;he adopted an Aboriginal child. When his first marriage broke down, as a single parent he personally sustained that child. What is more, he has never exposed that girl to the political process. Regardless of what mud of racism those on the opposition benches have thrown at him, he has never stood up and said, `I can defend myself from those remarks; I adopted an Aboriginal girl and she is still my daughter to this day.' He has never used her for political purposes; I am sure that others would. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition in this debate has taken account of certain facts. The fact is that this government has been in office for 11 years. Prior to its arrival, substantial funding was provided by the previous government. After years and years of expenditure and after years and years of speeches in this place, it is an unarguable fact that, in general, Aboriginal people are still severely disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, they have access to all the social security benefits that other people in the community are obliged to survive on. That has not helped. I am not blaming them for that. I am stating a fact. We have seen the creation of specialist Aboriginal health services, we have seen the creation of ATSIC, and we have seen the purchase of substantial areas of land. The situation is basically unchanged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen the growth of a very outspoken Aboriginal bureaucracy; that seems to be travelling pretty well. Mr Pearson got himself on the radio this morning. He claims to be the chief executive officer of the Cape York Land Council, but he apparently resides in Sydney. He is doing pretty well from the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the opposition's view: it is time to create programs that actually do something for Aboriginal people, that ensure that the people on the bottom of the pile get something out of this. In the context of the amendments that we propose is the simple proposition that maybe it is time to let some of these Aboriginal people actually own the land themselves, not have it administered by the Pearsons and the one-time Snowdons of this world. Why not have that happen?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put this question straight to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), who is at the table: why not support our amendment which provides with this money some priority so that ordinary Aboriginal people, acting in their own right, not only could obtain some land, but might be able to do something with the land they have got already? We have given to them, in our paternalistic fashion, inalienable freehold title&mdash;meaning, of course, that if an Aboriginal person wants to be an entrepreneur and wants to do something for Aboriginal people, that person will go out and borrow some money, as any other entrepreneurial person would do. But the Aboriginals cannot mortgage their land. They are not allowed to. Speaker after speaker in this place has been talking about the indigenous people's association with land, their commitment to their land and their need for land. The member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) will give us a similar lecture about that. But in the legislation we say, `We do not trust you with your own land. We will create mechanisms that give you no right to deal in that land.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is a land of many opportunities. We are saying to the Aboriginal people, `You are not entitled to a second chance.' Amongst the great skills which Aboriginal people possess is fishing. If a group of indigenous people who have obtained land under this scheme or one of the other schemes wishes to sell that land&mdash;as other Australians regularly do&mdash;and wants to buy a fishing boat and a fishing licence, why should we prevent it from doing so? The government is sneering at the amendment which has that effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased to hear Senator Chamarette say this morning that she would like to pursue that issue a little further. But I bet you that when those who profit most from all these arrangements&mdash;the wealthy Aboriginal bureaucracy&mdash;get a smell of the idea we will test them out. The member for Melbourne Ports is shaking his head. We will see whether they will come forward and support the opposition in arguing that these funds should, in the main, be taken away from the socialist concept of a land council, or from the structure proposed in this legislation, and be given to the members of an Aboriginal family, for instance, who have got some claims. Let them decide their future by the use of that land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We say in our amendments that it might not be a bad idea for the government to use a bit of money to make their existing properties viable. That is sneered at. Let me make a point and give an example. For many years, the people of the tribes&mdash;controlled or supported by Don McLeod, a white man&mdash;had Strelley and a couple of adjoining stations. They walked off those stations. It was not their choice to be pastoralists&mdash;that is our paternalistic view. Why not give them a chance? They cannot sell that land. They let the cattle seeking a drink fall down the wells. Do we blame them for that? Or do we blame the people who have got this European view that only pastoral properties would suit the welfare of Aboriginal people? Of course not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear a lot about the government's land bill. The High Court decided that Aboriginal people have rights to land. It made it incumbent on state governments, as the constitutional minders of land, to do something about it. The state governments were obliged to do something. They would have acted&mdash;they had to act&mdash;within the parameters set down by the High Court. But, no, we had to jump into it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear much from Mr Pearson from Sydney and all these other people who are apparently representing the Aboriginal people. They are not representing the Aboriginal people in my electorate. The Aboriginal people never see them; they do not know who they are. They object to visits by these people&mdash;men with heavy gold bracelets and other signs of their wealth&mdash;while they remain in poverty. They would rather see some of the wages that are paid to these people help their kids get through school. But that does not happen. Of course, we are told that this miracle Mabo legislation is being so well received out there and that this is the next step. In relation to that issue, Mr Arnold Franks, a confirmed Aboriginal elder, at 8.44 a.m. on 3 August on ABC regional radio's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Statewide</EMPHASIS>, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's happening . . . I think it's just about happening all over Australia but as far as I know for certain it's happened in the Pilbara. We've got an elder by the name of Billy Dunn; he went down and seen the Government about it in Perth. He's taken a map of his country and where his mother was born, and shows the different languages and the different people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now the Western Desert Aborigine Land Council and these other land councils have jumped over these blokes' head. He said they . . . all they say they're a mighty bunch of old people, we don't live in that way, we do it the white fellas way. And went ahead and done these things. So what Mr Keating has started in this state, I don't think he should be a prime minister. For a prime minister to start a war, and the war's on now. Blacks are fighting blacks now.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what Arnold Franks said on the radio. He was interviewed because he and another group of elders were having a meeting of Aborigines at Turner River to discuss their objections to the Aboriginal bureaucracy muscling in on their traditional rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked the parliamentary secretary whether a table could be included in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. One would think that the government would be interested in how $614,640 of taxpayers' money was spent, how that money might have been spent on the welfare of Aboriginal people, yet the parliamentary secretary declined to have the table included in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. What does he have to hide? If he genuinely believes that what he is doing is achieving something, why not investigate this matter?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A two-year $614,000 project to create an Aboriginal home building trust was established by the then Premier of Western Australia, the current Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence). That was an admirable pursuit. Housing is one of the great problems for disadvantaged people, Aboriginal or non-Aboriginal. The budget for the project was approved under the signature of then Premier Lawrence. The salary of the part-time chairman for the first year was $35,000. Vehicle and other expenses for the part-time chairman were $8,750. Those amounts are repeated in the second year. Project manager expenses total $7,900. The salary of the project manager was $89,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members would probably think that this project manager would be Aboriginal, but he is not. He is a white man. This is an example of jobs for the boys. His name happened to be Easton. He was the husband of Penny Easton, who subsequently suicided in Western Australia due to attacks made upon her integrity by members of the Labor Party, one upper house member, John Helden, in particular. Do not question that!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was this payment made to Easton for? Of course, the payment was duplicated? A total of $194,000 went to Easton and $83,000 to the part-time chairman&mdash;$277,000 out of $614,000 was spent and not even a stump has been put in the ground to build a house. Honourable members would think that we needed all these people to learn how to build houses!

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is about the bill. This is about how taxpayers' money is being spent. Our amendments address the key issues of accountability. That $200,000 that Easton received was also raised in the Family Court. He claimed to his wife at the time that it was a payback from some other jobs that he had done. So good money, deservedly applied to the Aboriginal community, was being used by then Premier Lawrence as a payback for other little jobs, mainly for sacking public servants. Honourable members can check the record on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have every right to raise our concerns in this area. We are not opposing the government's attempts to give assistance to Aboriginal people. We just want to see them get the help. If government members want to say that that is a wrong motive, get up and say it. We want every attempt made to focus this land issue on health, housing, education and economic issues. Do not get up and say you have done that. Do not get up and say, `That should be the focus of other money.' You have spent that&mdash;over $1 billion a year. You have paid them the normal social security benefits they are rightly entitled to, and they are still in desperate circumstances. Too often budgets such as this one are the way you spend Aboriginal money. We would like to think that on this occasion the money actually got to the people that Arnold Franks talks about&mdash;the genuine Aboriginal people that are being overrun by your bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the matter of accountability. There is a legion of evidence which suggests that money has been wasted. This happens time and time again. The other day I was told of one group that sat for a week arguing over whether or not it would shift the community toilets at a cost of $100 and then voted to buy two aeroplanes. That is silly. It is not helping those people with their health and education, which surely should come first. If anyone questions me on that, I can get the evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another group of Aborigines complained that their budget allocation from ATSIC came so late that they could only waste it. I have had two phone calls from people in my electorate who have purchased farms. I think that is great. They are good people who will do something with those farms. They just have a little problem: the government did not have any money left to buy them any tractors or farm machinery or to provide carry-on finance to fertilise the ground. I have corresponded with ATSIC, and the situation has not changed. Is this legislation simply tokenism? If it is, it is no good for Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), who will speak on this bill next, will state his views. Are you prepared to stop this process of giving the Noel Pearsons and a few others total control of all Aboriginal assets, or are you prepared to make a commitment and give priority to ordinary Aboriginal people&mdash;the people I referred to with those farms? Let them have the farms. If you cannot buy them the tractors, they can mortgage the farms and go and buy some machinery themselves. They are a good group. It is amazing what they have done. They diversified and brought in white sharefarmers. They are using the money saved from that measure to buy sheep and to graze the stubble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our amendments are not trickery. They are a request that you do something for Aboriginal people at the bottom of the pile&mdash;to give the Arnold Franks, the genuine elders, rights to some of their land; to ensure that those people who have become urban Aboriginals can get some of this money. We were told that those who had their native title rights extinguished would be the ones looked after. That is no longer the case, and we are back to arguing how we will deal with pastoral property. There are so many examples where pastoral property already provided has not been the panacea; it has not worked. People have walked away from such properties. They did not want them. They wanted to be urban Aboriginals. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Probably the oldest, continuing social problem in Australian society is the inequitable treatment of our indigenous people. Over the last two decades, following the Woodward commission and the introduction of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act by the Fraser government, the findings of that commission have largely been acted upon and provide the basis upon which a great deal of land has gone back to Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. However, with the defeat of the Fraser government, the coalition position on the rights of our indigenous people has been subject to continuous pressure from state leaders who have made no secret of the fact that they are fundamentally opposed to any concept of land rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most obvious example of that opposition was in Western Australia when the Burke government introduced a very moderate form of land rights which, at the time I was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, I believed did not go far enough. It was defeated by a Liberal-National Party coalition in the upper house. The then state Leader of the Liberal Party, Bill Hassell, made his position absolutely clear&mdash;he was opposed to the concept of land rights per se. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own state of Victoria, when a Labor government endeavoured to hand back a reserve at Framlingham, which Aboriginal people had lived on for many years, legislation was passed through the Legislative Assembly and again was defeated in the Legislative Council despite the fact that the precedent had been set by the former Bolte government when it returned Lake Tyers to the Aboriginal people. Again, it was necessary to pick up that legislation, bring it into this parliament and put it through&mdash;with the opposition voting against it because of so-called states rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the problem with the coalition&mdash;and it is evident in the way it has drafted the amendments here&mdash;is that it has great difficulty reconciling some of the things it says in this House when opposing the propositions which emerge quite clearly from its state leaders and its state bodies. It does not make any secret of the fact that it is opposed fundamentally to the whole question of Aboriginal people having a right to acquire land under any form of land rights legislation be it state or Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was therefore not surprising that when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) visited Western Australia he did not find it difficult to adopt some of the attitudes of Premier Court, and he made continuous and hysterical outbursts directed at the High Court, the highest judicial body in this land. At the state Liberal conference, and given the heady pressures that permeated the atmosphere, the new leader undoubtedly felt the need to be strong, true and brave. He had no difficulties when he threatened, to the applause of the assembled rednecks, that if he won the next election they could rely on him to tear up the Native Title Act. The less said about the Leader of the Opposition's sojourn to the Northern Territory the better. </PARA>

The Leader of the Opposition indicated, and everybody knows it, his lack of capacity to address the range of political assertions and attitudes of his own coalition members. He retreated into silence.

The big difference between the government and the opposition is that before this legislation was introduced into the parliament we had long and meaningful consultation with Aboriginal people about their perspective of the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well for this schoolboy Leader of the Opposition to get up and say to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), `Why don't you go there?' The fact is, the Prime Minister has spent more hours in consultation with Aboriginal people on these issues than the Leader of the Opposition has spent in the Northern Territory. That is the reality. The Prime Minister, as former Treasurer, showed an enormous sympathy for the arguments in cabinet of his ministers for Aboriginal affairs, and all his ministers have spent much of their lives visiting Aboriginal communities throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it interesting that the Leader of the Opposition did not choose to seek the advice of former ministers like Viner and Chaney, who were two out on the question of the native title legislation, before he went to the Western Australian conference. I do not agree with the position of the Northern Territory government on vetos, but there has been a very real change both within the attitudes of Aboriginal people and within sections of the mining industry towards how mining on Aboriginal land is developed. The Northern Territory government is aware of that. It was obvious that the Leader of the Opposition was not concerned to seek the advice. He thoroughly misunderstood the provisions of the act and after he came back was told by Mr Perron that he would be only too happy to give him a few lessons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How did we get to the situation we are now in? We are not told by the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;who walks into this House with a record of not even comprehending the issues&mdash;`We would like a bit of time to sit down and confer with Aboriginal people.' How much discussion was had between the relevant coalition policy committee and the Aboriginal people in order to seek their views in respect of this legislation? That is the difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation, and no-one says any piece of legislation in this area is perfect, has involved hours of discussion and negotiation with elected Aboriginal leaders to seek their perception of what they believe their people need and want&mdash;and what we get from the opposition is a series of amendments. `Oh, yes,' says the Leader of the Opposition, `we'll vote for this legislation if you accept our amendments in toto dealing with health, housing and education.' `What is wrong with that?' he says. I will tell you what is wrong with it. There is enormous diversity in the quality of housing, the quality of education and the quality of health for Aboriginal people both within states and between states. The reality is that the administration of those areas is essentially the responsibility of state governments. When dealing with housing, as it is a state matter, they insist that Commonwealth funds flow and then they will organise Aboriginal housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some exceptions to that. Aboriginal people have, in many parts of Australia, their own health services. Why did they want them set up? Because the level of service they were getting through state administrations was totally inadequate for their needs. Time does not permit me to go into the history of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a land bill and the purpose of the fund is to acquire land for Aboriginal people who cannot succeed under the concepts enunciated by the High Court because they have been severely dispossessed. The funds are not all that extensive. The opposition is proposing that we dilute those funds. Those opposite say, `We don't want to know about other funds or other legislation which might be relevant in these areas of education, housing and health. We insist that when you look at the question of land, you look at the question of health, housing and education.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That sounds all right if we applied those standards to everybody in Western Australia or the Northern Territory who was a land developer. Do we say to a land developer who is using private funds, `Before you even acquire the land, let alone develop it, we have to be satisfied that the land is in close proximity to a school, which will deal with the problems of children, and that there is a level of medical service clearly and demonstrably available'? Of course we do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of a sudden we have these confected amendments. I do not have any problem with the opposition saying that it wants proper accountability of these funds. No Aboriginal person will object to that; ATSIC will not object to that; the government will not object to that. Public moneys have to be accounted for. I do not even object to the opposition saying that it is concerned about the issues of education, housing and health. We all ought to be concerned about them. But if opposition members were being honest they would say that they are concerned about these factors; they would not make them a condition of their support for this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No member of the opposition will get up in this parliament and say, `We took a lot of time off. We spoke to Aboriginal people. We are a coalition that does not have any problem at all'&mdash;as is its right and its duty&mdash;`with talking to farming or mining groups about legislation which affects them or with talking to any group in Australian society which feels it can be adversely affected or positively assisted by legislation.' The opposition should get up in this House and tell us how it communicated with Aboriginal people and what sort of support and response it got from Aboriginal people for these amendments. It cannot do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason it cannot is that, at the end of the day, these amendments were not designed to represent genuine concerns. The amendments were designed to resolve the internal problems that this coalition is faced with. The Liberal Party has prominent state leaders saying that they will not have a bar of land going to Aboriginal people. When a former leader, who once said he was the conscience of the party, was being sacked, the party should have confected a series of amendments and said, `These amendments represent our genuine concern, and you have to pick up all of them. If you don't adopt all of them, we are going to vote against the legislation.' That way it would have been safe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The moderates in the party could have said, `Yes, our heart bleeds on these issues.' Those from the Right could have said, `We know what is going to happen. We will vote against it.' They would have voted against it because the government would not pick up these amendments. The government's position, having consulted with Aboriginal people, has produced legislation that they see as relevant to their needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, what we have here is a political exercise on an issue that goes to the whole question of social equality and justice in our community. The Leader of the Opposition, who wants to be strong, true and brave&mdash;an overgrown boy scout who has enough innate decency to wear long trousers&mdash;comes into this parliament and says, `We have these great amendments which solve our political problems. It may do something for Aboriginal people but, if you do not accept them, we are going to vote against the legislation.' It is a gutless and dishonest political performance. He knows, if we were to accept them, that the fund being created for land purchase could be corrupted to a point where it conferred no real benefit on Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The challenge that this parliament has to face up to sooner or later is whether we are going to stand committed to the rights of Aboriginal people&mdash;not merely to own their land but to take their place in Australian society.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He completely ignored the real issues that concern our Aboriginal people. All he did was try to brush over his involvement as a former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and that of those who followed him. Who could ever forget what happened a few weeks ago when Gerry Hand, the honourable member's successor as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, was asked on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program why the poverty and the despair continue unabated? He choked on his words, put up his hands and said, `I don't know the answers.' After 11 years, the government cannot do anything except attack the opposition and engage in cynical political debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have put up amendments which the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) rejected out of hand before even seeing them; yet they called for a bipartisan approach. The bipartisan approach the government wants is for us to agree with the legislation without qualification and unquestioningly. The Prime Minister's idea of bipartisanship is total agreement&mdash;not in any way a constructive dialogue where agreements can be reached, but instead just total agreement with what the government puts up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs does not want to talk about housing, health, education or employment for Aboriginal people. In fact, he made the extraordinary statement, which the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will preserve for posterity&mdash;that housing, health and education were the responsibility of the state governments. So why do we have a federal minister for housing? Why do we have a federal minister for health?  Why do we have a federal minister for education? Why in that case do we even have a minister for Aboriginal affairs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government knows very well that a large amount of Commonwealth funding, ATSIC funding, is directed exactly towards these areas of concern. Indeed, many of the grants to the state governments are tied. That the government would wash its hands, saying, `All we need to talk about is land, not housing, health or education because they are state government responsibilities,' is remarkable, particularly as the government attacks us for believing that land management is the responsibility of the state governments. No, the government does not want to discuss these hard issues because its record after 11 years is shameful. It thinks that the granting of land is the panacea. It is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Melbourne Ports also accuses the opposition of not talking to Aboriginal representatives. That is demonstrably wrong. But, even more importantly, the majority of Aboriginal people are within electorates represented by the National and Liberal parties. We live and speak with these people in our own communities. For me it is East Gippsland. The honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) and others speak constantly with their Aboriginal constituents. It is not enough&mdash;whatever field of government administration is involved&mdash;to talk to the lobbyists or those with set political agendas; you have to talk to local communities. Consequently, our views and policies are formed more directly by the people concerned than by those who are feeding off the Aboriginal affairs industry. And make no mistake: there is a whole level of self-interested individuals and bureaucrats who are manipulating Aboriginal affairs for their own purposes, whether they be purely individual or collectively political. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I take advice just from the representative of the land councils or ATSIC I will not be properly representing the views of Aboriginal people. You have to travel to the Kimberley, Cape York and the Northern Territory, western New South Wales, western Queensland and South Australia to properly understand what concerns Aboriginal communities on a day-to-day basis. Land is important. The opposition knows that to be so. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) reiterated that in his address yesterday. For that reason, coalition governments at a state level have previously been involved with the establishment and administration of land funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition welcomes the legislation before the House. We simply want to make it more accountable and more focused. The amendments we propose will refocus the legislation to address the health, housing, education and economic opportunities of Aboriginal people. We could have a sensible, rational debate but, instead, the government, knowing that its 11 years in office has not alleviated the poverty and problems in so many Aboriginal communities throughout different parts of Australia, just wants to appease the many white consciences who do not want to be troubled or bothered facing up to the real issues. The real issues are the health, housing, education, employment and economic opportunities for our indigenous people. We have to address these key issues. You can do that in conjunction with the buying of land and the establishment of the land fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal and National parties recognised the High Court decision on Mabo from the outset and accepted it. We supported the retention of the Racial Discrimination Act. But we believe that under the constitution land management is a state responsibility. We have continued to stand for Aboriginal rights to land, but not in isolation of the issues that affect the living conditions and future hopes and aspirations of Aboriginal people. We have to recognise that states have the constitutional responsibility for land management. There is a need for this to be maintained because a Commonwealth takeover is simply impractical, leaving aside  the questions of constitutional law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The states together grant more than 50,000 titles a year. The Commonwealth is in no position to do that. There must be, in regard to the native title legislation, a cooperative arrangement with the states, which the Prime Minister sought briefly but then abandoned when it meant that he had to acknowledge the simple point that the states have responsibility for land management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill, it has been said by many, not least of all and most recently by the President of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Brendan Nelson, that land is tied to the health of Aboriginal communities. I wish it were that simple. The evidence accumulated shows that the worst infant mortality rates, the highest rates of disease and the highest mortality rates are centred on the more remote Aboriginal communities. Land is not the only determinant of the health of Aboriginal people. If it were that easy, the problem would be easily overcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This question of remoteness is one that we have to face up to. The problem with discussing all the different and sometimes related issues of Aboriginal affairs is that there is no objectivity. There are just too many people with a vested interest in preserving their own position or their own prejudices. Consequently we cannot discuss things like remoteness. The further Aborigines are removed from basic infrastructure such as schooling, water, sewerage or health clinics, the more vulnerable they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I worry as I travel throughout northern parts of Australia that small communities, often of no more than a dozen or two dozen people, are living in appalling conditions because local authorities or ATSIC simply cannot provide the infrastructure. You cannot provide the roads and the power and the water to every community which wants to live in its own remote location. We have to face up to issues like remoteness but we cannot, because otherwise we are accused of mainstreaming&mdash;`You want to integrate Aboriginal communities with larger Aboriginal communities or even with white communities.' That is not the case at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pessimistic about whether we can improve health and education for many Aboriginal communities, because they live in places so distant from where those facilities are provided. One cannot, for example, prescribe that a community of 12 has to live within 100 kilometres of Alice Springs: that is not my suggestion at all. I have tried in the past to discuss this issue of remoteness and have been shouted down. That is just one small example of how hard it is to discuss such issues on a rational basis. It seems all too often that, if you mouth the cliches and make the promises, you win the support of the Aboriginal affairs industry&mdash;and, sadly, of most of the media. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it all boils down, the fact is that urban white consciences do not want to be bothered with Aboriginal problems. Why else would white Australia, particularly along the eastern coast, have allowed the scandal of the waste of money on a massive scale to continue for so long, unchecked? There is simply not enough accountability across the board. I am afraid that I have come to the conclusion that one can very easily play this game to win electoral support, because of an obliging media and an uninterested white Australia which does not want to be told of the depth of the problems. `Throw money at the problem and do not bother us. Throw land at the problem and do not bother us.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is, firstly, that this is not materially benefiting our indigenous people; and, secondly, it is dividing those parts of Australia that are directly concerned. Let us not beat about the bush: if one travels the Kimberley or northern Queensland, or some of the towns of western New South Wales, one will see the mutual hatreds and the divisions. I do not want to paint too dismal a picture of Aboriginal affairs, because of course there have been tremendous improvements, and individual as well as community successes. I know that fact from East Gippsland, where we have very harmonious and mutually beneficial relations between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But such things are all relative, and the situation is that since 1967, when a Liberal and National Party government introduced the referendum to give Aboriginal people a vote, simply not enough progress has been made. Is it such a crime for us on the opposition benches to want the rate of progress to accelerate, and for us to be totally dissatisfied with what we see with our own eyes, as well as with what Aboriginal people tell us to our faces? The opposition amendments will genuinely attempt to improve the situation and will be worthy of the utmost serious consideration by the government, rather than the out-of-hand rejection that we have seen over the last 24 hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In drawing to a conclusion, I say that there are many issues and problems that we as a parliament have to address. We are not going to begin to address them as long as we pretend there are simple, single solutions such as land rights, and we certainly will not make any progress as long as Aboriginal affairs remain probably the most partisan issue that comes before this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the government to acknowledge that unacceptable progress has been made on the issues of housing, health, education and employment. Once the government acknowledges that, then that should lead it to consider the amendments that the opposition intends to propose. We put them forward in a genuine attempt to try to bridge some of the gaps that exist within this parliament and that exist in the communities where Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people live together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as I am concerned, you can forget Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and even Adelaide. I am afraid the non-Aboriginal populations of those cities have largely shown themselves to be quite uninterested in this issue. Sure, you will find the occasional letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> or the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, but there is no serious analysis, because those people are not confronted on a daily basis with the issues of land and social harmony. But I do not think we can allow the gap in living standards and in social interaction in the Pilbara, Cape York and the Northern Territory to widen any more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an enormous responsibility on every member of this House to face up to the problems and to address them. The opposition can raise the issues and we can make the important points, but in the end the responsibility rests with the government. As long as the government wants to play political games because it wants to justify its 11 years of managing Aboriginal affairs, the losers will be our indigenous people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not intend to speak on this bill, the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill. The government's support of, and commitment to, Aboriginal land ownership are well documented and well conveyed to the community. One could surely be forgiven if, after reading the papers earlier this week, one felt that the newly converted Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) was going to listen to the moderates in his own party and display some of that bipartisan goodwill that he so emotionally called for yesterday. I feel compelled to speak because the debate to date not only shows a divided opposition but reveals its complete lack of understanding of what land ownership means to Aboriginal people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of weeks ago it appeared that the well-known conversion of Saul, or Paul, on the road to Damascus had paled into insignificance by comparison with the conversion of the Leader of the Opposition on the road to Kintore or Utopia. There was a major difference, though: after a period of time the scales fell off Paul's eyes and he could see. It would appear the scales have yet to fall off the eyes of the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned that the opposition was divided. Let us have a look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of yesterday to see what the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), had to say about land ownership:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore land purchased is to keep the title of freehold or leasehold under which it is purchased . . . To do otherwise is to treat Aboriginal people as if they were different or inadequate in the area of land ownership.</PARA>
<PARA>She went on to talk about land ownership by families, individuals and partnerships, with never a consideration for traditional land ownership patterns of Aboriginal people. Compare the shadow minister's statement with that of her leader. Again I quote from yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, we recognise that at present much of the land held by indigenous people is underused. The land management section of the bill must be strengthened and enhanced so as to give priority to the development of land which is underutilised.</PARA>
<PARA>So on the one hand we have the shadow minister saying that Aboriginal people must be treated exactly the same as everyone else, but on the other we have her leader saying that we need to pass a judgment on how they use their land or they will not get any more. Of course, in doing so he is denying one of the great tenets of the Liberal Party, and that is freedom of choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the crux of the problem. The opposition simply does not understand what land means to Aboriginal people or what the concept of land ownership is all about. They can measure it only by European standards, and they have been doing that for 200 years. To members of the opposition, a piece of land is what it can produce: what can be grown on it and cut down on it and sold as woodchip; what can be dug up from underneath it, maybe uranium or coal or iron ore, and produce export earnings; or what houses can be built on it to put people in. They never consider how Aboriginal people have traditionally looked at the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us consider more carefully what the Leader of the Opposition had to say, because it is very interesting, especially when his shadow minister is saying that Aboriginal people must be treated the same as everyone else. I ask the opposition how it can defend some of its mates who have vast tracts of underutilised land. The opposition should go to them and say, `You are underutilising that land, buddy. You cannot sit on it and pass it on from generation to generation, and one day maybe develop it and put a casino on it&mdash;if only we can find a straight licensee.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate has degenerated into two approaches. On the one hand, there are statements of support and understanding by government members. On the other hand, there are statements that reflect a complete lack of understanding by the opposition, which is trying to thread a tortuous path by looking after the various people with interests in land ownership. The opposition tactics concerning this bill can be seen only as a device to disguise the coalition's unwillingness to allow Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people access to their land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage I would like to relate a couple of my own experiences. In my electorate I have five different tribal groups. A couple of weeks ago I attended a demonstration. A local government area is attempting to develop a piece of land that the Aboriginal women of the area claim is a traditional Aboriginal birthing site. That is very important to their tradition. The local council cannot see it. It wants to develop this piece of land, which is completely covered by trees that are possibly 200 years old. Some of them were probably there at the time the First Fleet landed in Botany Bay. However, all the council can see is that by bulldozing that land and filling it with up to two metres of sand it can probably make a $1.6 million profit. The council cannot understand the Aboriginal point of view. I think that is the stalemate that we have reached here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition keeps measuring the value of land in dollars and cents. We keep measuring its value to Aboriginal culture. I disagree with the member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran). I am sure that the message is getting out to white Australia. I am sure that there are millions of white Australians who understand exactly what land means to Aboriginal people in a traditional sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition members are reluctant to talk about history and the way in which Aboriginal people were deprived of their land because there are many stories that really are a disgrace. I was on Fraser Island a couple of weeks ago with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts. While we were having a look over the island with a guide, we went to a place that is called Central Station, where in the past there had been a massive sawmilling operation. A few artefacts of the logging history of Fraser Island are on display there. My wife asked the guide, `What about the Aboriginal population on the island?' He said, `There aren't any. There used to be. Fraser Island once had the greatest density of Aboriginal population in the whole of Australia. Today, not a single Aborigine lives on Fraser Island.' So the guide was asked, `What happened to the Aborigines?' He said, `When they started logging, it was inconvenient to have them here, so they were phased out.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The `phasing out' of Aborigines has not only occurred on Fraser Island; it has occurred everywhere. On the way home in the plane, I read what `phasing out' of Aborigines on Fraser Island meant. It meant bringing Europeanised Aborigines onto the island and paying them as policemen. Riding on horseback, they drove the Aborigines into the surf, where they drowned or were taken by sharks. In the end, for the cause of white settlement and the exploitation of the magnificent timber reserves on that island, there was no opposition; there were very few Aborigines and they were relocated to missions. That is a story that can be repeated all over Australia, and that is what this legislation is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what is misunderstood. How can you pay for that sort of treatment of a noble race of people that were simply `phased out' because they did not understand our way or because we did not make any attempt to understand theirs? I appeal to the opposition for goodness sake to get its act together and try to understand what it is all about, because the arguments it has used to date certainly indicate that it does not understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude with the statement that was made by Noel Pearson this morning on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS>. Noel Pearson is the executive director of Cape York Land Council. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What's got to be understood is people love that land; they love those rocks and the stunted mulga; people cry for that country. It's spiritually important to people, and that's an understanding that I see has failed to reach the minds of the Liberal Party to date. . .</PARA>
<PARA>Either the opposition supports this legislation or, to the everlasting disgust of the people of Australia, it will go down in history as a party that failed to come to terms with the facts as they are, with the history of this nation and with the shame that we continue to hide. But Aboriginal people of Australia must have justice and, proudly, this government will make sure they get it. </PARA>

I reject totally the comments of the previous speaker, the member for Paterson (Mr Horne), in relation to the part being played by those on this side of the House in this debate. I reject the suggestion that he has made that we do not understand or do not care. I believe that our contributions to this debate have illustrated to the contrary, and I hope that my contribution will do likewise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia today is multicultural and diverse. Unfortunately, many&mdash;if not most&mdash;Australians are unsympathetic to Aborigines. Most Australians, I suspect, do not really understand them. Their causes&mdash;many of them justifiable&mdash;have often been misrepresented or damaged by well-meaning non-Aborigines and the radical very few part-Aborigines who set themselves up as spokesmen for Aboriginal concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that, as some of our speakers said yesterday and as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) and the opposition spokesman on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs&mdash;the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus)&mdash;have suggested, this government has used Aborigines as a political football. The way it has approached the debate on this particular legislation is a further glaring example of that. The government is led by the most divisive Prime Minister in our history. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) divides consciously, determinately, with every word he utters. For his own base political purposes, he has set out to divide Australians on many issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The divisiveness of the Prime Minister in this debate has harmed the process of reconciliation. For any other leader, bipartisanship would have been a priority in this matter, but this Prime Minister does not understand the meaning of that word. He has come up through that school of politics which does not take prisoners, and he knows only one way of operating, which is confrontation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the opposition is committed to addressing the real needs of Aborigines. Already in this debate the Leader of the Opposition has provided poignant evidence of the extent of the Aborigines' disadvantage in health and education relative to other Australians. The statistics the Leader of the Opposition put before the parliament yesterday tell a very sad story about Aboriginal health. The statistics are a disgrace to all Australians. They speak volumes about what has been achieved by this government over the past 11 years. Its record is indefensible. It is a record of failure; it is a record of words but no action; it is a record of waste and misuse of taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder that most Australians are confused about the images they have of Aborigines when they visit Central Australia or north-west Australia or when they see Aborigines on television. They see people living in disgraceful conditions, often under the influence of alcohol, despite the billions of dollars which have been given to them in welfare payments. Naturally, people wonder where all this money has gone. This government's solution to most problems has been to throw taxpayers' money at them, and its treatment of Aborigines has been no different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest in this saga of hollow rhetoric is the land acquisition and land fund bill, which follows the Native Title Act&mdash;the government's response to the High Court's Mabo decision. Much has been said in this debate about how the Native Title Act has failed&mdash;other than symbolically&mdash;to do anything in practice to assist Aborigines. This government and the Prime Minister in particular, however, are really about symbolism. The government has made a fine art of tokenism. The whole concept of native title has caused enormous disruption to Australia's mining, rural and tourism industries. It has cost Australia a huge amount in lost investment dollars. It would be difficult to quantify the amount involved, but it represents an indirect cost to all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we have yet another cost which will be imposed&mdash;an interim $200 million, with a further $121 million, indexed, to be allocated over the following nine years. Non-Aboriginal Australians may wonder why. Will this money actually achieve any real objective, or will it be yet again misdirected or wasted? This is an entirely reasonable question for Australian taxpayers to ask. This is not the government's money which it is attempting to spend and will spend if this legislation goes through; it is taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already in this debate there has been considerable discussion about Aboriginal attachment to the land. The point has been made, very correctly, that we all have in one way or another an attachment to land. However, it has been pointed out&mdash;and even the previous speaker, the honourable member for Paterson, made the point again&mdash;that the Aboriginal attachment to land is a spiritual attachment. Aboriginal beliefs are traditionally animistic. Many have become Christians, despite some of the very poor examples of Christian love and charity they have experienced over the years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This does not mean, however, that those who become Christians have turned their backs on their culture; quite the contrary. They have refocused their spirituality. I believe that God respects their culture, and so should we. Ultimately, all of us are uniquely related to the land. We came from it and physically we shall return to it, as ashes to ashes and dust to dust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments that the opposition will propose to this bill are intended to focus attention on the real needs of Aboriginal people. They are intended to give the government an opportunity to demonstrate its bona fides in Aboriginal affairs. The opposition is committed to the process of reconciliation. We have made that perfectly clear on many occasions. Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition recounted the circumstances through which negotiations were carried on between his predecessor and the former Prime Minister to arrive at a bipartisan approach to the process of reconciliation, or indeed to the concept of reconciliation in the first instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the whole process of reconciliation has been misunderstood by the majority of Australians, who see no need to apologise for what happened 200 years ago. The fact of this misunderstanding is, once again, the fault of this government, which has relied on propaganda and politics rather than education to bring about true bipartisan support for this process of reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reconciliation may yet take another hundred years. I believe that today's Australians need to be convinced that we have a responsibility to redress the wrongs of displacement and dispersion which occurred 200 years ago. It is not an easy concept for many of today's Australians to grasp. It is, however, an entirely Christian response to espouse reconciliation. Aborigines have been marginalised and have lost their sense of identity. We should be compassionate and understanding of their present situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think anybody pretends that there have not been faults on both sides. I think in the end only a minority of Aborigines seek compensation&mdash;whatever that means. Most, I believe, understand that they must take responsibility for their own destiny. They indicate, when they have an opportunity to do so, that that is what they want to do. In many communities a new and younger generation of Aborigines is doing this. They want to break out of the trap which handouts have caught them in. Like many Australians, Aborigines have huge problems with alcoholism. They also want to address that problem for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should not underestimate the contributions that Aboriginal Australians have made to this country, in art, in sport and in public service. Most Aborigines want to be good Australians. Some fought for this country in war alongside other Australians who were their mates. So land per se is not the answer to Aborigines' problems. It has been clearly demonstrated in this debate&mdash;and as far as I can tell it has not been refuted from the government side&mdash;that this has been the case in states where Aborigines already have land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Possession of land per se has not addressed the core problems of health and education that Aborigines experience in the disadvantaged state in which they live. To give Aborigines land may be symbolic&mdash;and that is part of the government's intention&mdash;but our priority ought to be to address their disadvantages. They are disadvantaged Australians. There can be no more excuses for this. We have had 11 years of excuses. Now is the time for action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are tired of this government's use of Aboriginal affairs to play politics. Let us see something real and tangible. It is now time for the government to illustrate clearly, to us and to the Australian people, its bona fides by entering into a process of giving serious considerations to the amendments that we propose to this legislation, which will give the legislation the effect that it really ought to have. The ball is now in the government's court, and all Australia is watching to see how the government plays it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The public perception of the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill and the larger legislation which predates it&mdash;the native title legislation&mdash;is that it will have an impact only in the more remote areas of Australia such as western Queensland and western New South Wales and that there is far greater support in urban Australia for these government initiatives than there is in rural and regional Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People in urban Australia are living secure in their minds that there will be none of the disruptions to their lives or their activities which are now engulfing much of regional and rural and remote Australia, caused by the uncertainty that is being created by these two pieces of legislation. I hope that urban Australia is also engulfed and that there are claims in the major regional cities and the capital cities of this country. Urban people may then start to have some understanding of what this means right now in rural and regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a perception that it is only Aboriginal people who have a mystical, symbolic or religious attachment to the land, and that this can stay with them, even after they have spent several generations in suburbia. As an Anglo-Celtic, fifth generation farmer, I say that that is a wrong perception. It is our fault, as Anglo-Celtic rural people, that we have never expressed it. It is a different feeling to that which people might have in relation to the security of their own home or affection for their neighbourhood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It relates to the soil, to the trees, to the flora and fauna, to the growing of things. It is mystical and emotional, and it has a tremendous impact on those people who are a part of it. It is only rural people who can understand that. They can understand the Aboriginal attachment, and I would hope that Aborigines and others can also understand their attachment. It is a great worry to me. When we talk about historic dispossession in relation to this legislation, we should also be thinking of dispossession of land-holders affected by claims, of land-holders affected by drought, and so forth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this public perception that it is only going to happen in the more remote areas has already been proven wrong in Victoria. The Yorta-Yorta claim, the fourth under the native title legislation for Australia, has already been approved in principle, and that claim covers quite a percentage of my electorate in northern Victoria. The registrations of interest closed two days ago, and the next stage begins next month: the mediation process which will then determine whether or not appeals are made to the court. The primary claim, which has been accepted in principle by the tribunal, covers over 1,000 square kilometres. There is a secondary claim for compensation which covers many thousands of square kilometres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have indicated that the claim is mainly in my electorate, but it also covers elements of the Indi, McEwen and Farrer electorates as well. The claim covers the Murray River from Rutherglen to Koondrook and the red gum forests&mdash;the largest and most significant red gum forests in Australia&mdash;on both sides of the river. It covers the Goulburn River upstream to Murchison, and other rivers in north-eastern Victoria. It covers all crown land within the larger area with the exception of the state agricultural research farms, which were subsequently deleted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are over 150 separate claims. Many of these are for river frontage grazing, but there is also a significant percentage covering local sports grounds, recreation parks, and nature and walking trails belonging to the communities&mdash;because those public facilities are almost always on crown land and are usually close to the river. So we are talking about local government capital in these facilities, amounting to millions of dollars, being subject to the primary claim. The overall impact is one of confusion, uncertainty and resentment, and that is not just confined to white people either. There is considerable resentment from Aboriginal people too, and I will refer to that fact later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to concentrate on this impact and make some positive suggestions to help for the future. I have already made some of these suggestions to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) and to one of the senior advisers to the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch). I commend Minister Tickner for the trouble he went to, before he left for overseas, to make contact with me. I acknowledge that my area is one of the first claims, so hopefully some of the confusion will abate in the future as more claims are worked through. I also acknowledge that tribunal members attended two meetings in the area but, unfortunately, the result of their visits was to add to the confusion and the uncertainty, because they themselves&mdash;and I do not say this as a criticism&mdash;do not appear to know exactly what is going to happen and how.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My first suggestion concerns the question of criteria for initial or in-principle approval for a claim. I believe the approval is too automatic: there is no ability to challenge by anyone at that stage; no information or detail is available to anyone at that stage from the tribunal&mdash;as I was told on several occasions after making phone calls&mdash;and there is certainly nothing available from the applicants. Let me put it another way: in my case, the applicants themselves did not give any information, because they were under instructions from their solicitors not to do so. This is an area that definitely needs amendment, and I hope that it is one that is being considered, because we are adding to the confusion and the uncertainty and the feeling of unfairness at the first stage of the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My second suggestion is related to this, and it is more general. No-one has any ordinary ability to see the detail of the claims at any time. There is no publicity to clarify the procedures, and there are no information pamphlets available to anyone to explain what is happening and how. In the case of the Yorta-Yorta claim, the only detail was available from the Perth office. It was not available from Melbourne and not available locally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only official publicity at any stage was two small advertisements in two local papers relating to the closing date for registration of interest if a group wanted to be included in the mediation process. The only way to obtain that information, through which any person could find out whether or not they would be affected, was to pay $270 for those details to be sent from Perth. I obtained two, one for my office in Shepparton and one in association with my state colleague, Noel Maughan, and his office in Echuca. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one that was sent was so poor that if it was going to last any time at all it had to be laminated, so there was an additional cost for that. As I indicated earlier, the Yorta-Yorta were not saying anything. They were sending everybody around to my office. Some of them also came around to have a look for themselves. That was fair enough in that case. However, in total it is a most unfair, unjust and inequitable situation, which just adds to the uncertainty and the confusion. That is irrespective of whether you are for the legislation or against the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it were a state planning process, the person with the application would have to provide details of what that would mean in a number of places. Surely, the same should apply here. As a minimum, the tribunal should be instructed by the government and the facilities made available for them to do so, to provide in each local government area, in a claimed situation, a copy of the details, so there is fairness and justice for everybody and so some of this confusion and uncertainty can be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point is the role of the states. In the case of Victoria, it was ill prepared and of no help. I do not make that statement in relation to whether the state is for or against the legislation, but most of the claim, of course, is on state crown land. There are not adequate records. I will give you one example. A constituent came to see me concerning a lease that that person has on some river frontage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On checking with the state department on how many years that lease had been available for the point of continuous association, that person was advised there were no records available. He was sent a copy of the original title, which goes back to pre-Torrens days. It is a pre-emptive right, which actually goes into the middle of the river, which was part of the claim situation. That then raises the interesting question: if it is a pre-emptive freehold title, how can the state be requiring a lease fee? So the states themselves have got a lot of sorting out to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer again to the Barmah State Forest and the Murray River in that area, which is now quite a significant tourist area with boat operators, tour operators and so forth, and logging and grazing. All of the leasing has been put in abeyance, so there is complete confusion as to what they can do at this stage. The state obviously had not done any homework on that either. The state of Victoria has to recognise that it is involved in this situation and it will have to do some homework with regard to its records and procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other request that I made to the two ministers, and which I make to the government today, is that equal assistance be given to those affected by the claim as is given to the applicant. That does not just mean the affected land-holders, but it also means other Aboriginal groups. I give the example of my area. The Yorta-Yorta people have made the claim, but there are two other competing claims. The Bangerang people in particular have very strong historical and anthropological evidence that they really are the ones who should be making the claim and that, if a claim is granted, it should be to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is no legal aid available to the Bangerang people because under the Aboriginal legal aid arrangements evidently it was not considered that legal aid would be needed between two competing Aboriginal groups. So this group of people&mdash;and I do feel very sorry for the Bangerang&mdash;is getting no assistance whatsoever. These people do not know what to do, yet they are the strongest claimants to at least a section of that claim. That, in itself, is grossly unfair and unjust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I appeal to the government&mdash;and to the minister here, as I have to two other ministers&mdash;that they should, irrespective of individual attitudes to either of these pieces of legislation, help to clarify the procedures, reduce the confusion and uncertainty, and bring far more equity into the whole process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There needs to be a requirement that the details are available as a right in a reasonable number of places in a claim area. The detailed documents are nine inches to a foot high&mdash;whatever that is in metric. It is only by perusing those documents&mdash;in this case, the 150 claims&mdash;that people really have any idea of whether they are involved. I am making a genuine request for equity in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second request is that those who are affected or have a counterclaim against those who made the original claim have the same right to legal aid as the original claimants. That legal aid is provided at no cost to the original claimants but at considerable cost to the taxpayers. In particular, I refer to other Aboriginal groups who, at this stage, are being left in a most unfair and unjust situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like most members of this House, I have considered the legislation that the government indicated some time ago it was going to introduce. Today we are discussing the federal government's decision to provide about $1 billion for the acquisition of land by Aboriginal groups by means of a fairly centralised process, originating here in Canberra and affecting various Aboriginal groups.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was somewhat concerned about the government's decision and its response to the High Court decision on Mabo, so during the recess I spent a couple of weeks in northern Australia, basically living in Aboriginal communities and listening to what they had to say about their future and their prospects. I heard little discussion of land. I heard a lot about their concern about drug and alcohol abuse, about gambling abuse and about their concern for their young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's decision to fund the purchase of land to such a huge extent deserves serious scrutiny, because this type of purchase has been going on in Australia for almost 20 years. We need to examine whether the land acquisition programs&mdash;instigated by the federal government and carried out, first of all, in the Northern Territory&mdash;have produced the result it was claimed they would, and whether the government's intention is going to be well directed and successful or whether it needs to look again at whether Aboriginal problems in Australia are based on lack of opportunity to live on the land or whether they originate somewhere else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my examination I am concerned that the government's commitment to the purchase of land seems to hinge more on who the government's friends are in the Aboriginal community and on whether the bureaucratic process the government has established is massaging its friends and the law firms. Is there real concern for the Aboriginal people? I have to be convinced that it is a matter of concern for the Aboriginal people that leads the government down this pathway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the best of my ability, I have tried to fairly assess the situation. I would like to know whether the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) has travelled to, and lived with, Aboriginal communities to find out for himself. I do not believe he has. I believe he would react with a Pavlov style knee jerk and jump to whatever the executive of his party said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary secretary has never stood up against his party and he is not going to start now. That is his record. Let us be objective about this thing and have a look at what the gains have been for the Aboriginal people. If you have a look at the land process for Aboriginal people, you can judge that over the last 20 years there has been no real gain and real advantage for the Aboriginal people. If you take objective measurements, the age standardised mortality rates or things like respiratory diseases, infectious diseases and circulatory system problems, you would have to say that is where the real problems are, and there does not appear to be any change, despite the resources that have been put into land acquisition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No correlation.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SD4">Mr CADMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no correlation at all. You would think that, if this is going to be the process of best assistance, there would be some benefit demonstrable over that period of 20 years, and there is not. So the government appears to be saying that it is more important for us to spend $1 billion in having Aboriginal people acquire land than to stop them dying. I cannot see what the value base of that sort of judgment can be. What the parliamentary secretary at the table is implying is that it is culturally more important to allow people to die than it is to take care of their health needs.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SD4">Mr CADMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You can say that it is rubbish, but that is the fact of the matter. You have got 20 years demonstrated lack of change in health standards through land acquisition programs and you are going to pursue that further. I would like one day to have a look at who are the beneficiaries of the commissions paid, the legal fees that are in train. Who are the beneficiaries of all of the side benefits of some of this? It is a matter that concerns the whole community. If one speaks quietly to leaders in the Aboriginal community, what they say is, `Look, we're not going to dump on somebody who is our friend'&mdash;or perhaps a relative&mdash;`but we too are concerned.' The remediation programs that are sponsored by the federal government for drug and alcohol abuse have to deal with cases that are active. A person has to be abusing alcohol or abusing drugs before funding will take place. The preventive programs are non-existent. One cannot talk about preventive programs being funded for Aboriginal health.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the government's effort is completely misdirected. The government has been at this thing for 10 or 11 years and does not seem to have learned that it can assess things objectively, it can look at things fairly and it does not have to go to the totality of land acquisition as if it were some sort of mystical process. There is an attachment to the land for the Aboriginal people, but evidently people in the Labor Party are prepared to say that that mystical attachment is more significant than preventing people from dying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The graphs on health are absolutely shocking, and it is obvious that nobody in the Labor Party has looked at the fact that the standardised mortality rates amongst Aboriginals in Arnhem Land or Tennant Creek are four or five times that of the rest of the community. Why have you not looked at that? Fred Hollows was out there and he drew your attention to it. Until he started doing things that did not favour the government, until he failed to be politically correct with this government, it endorsed and canonised Fred Hollows. As soon as Fred started saying things that were critical of the government, started pointing out some of the facts of Aboriginal health, these people dumped Fred Hollows. You would not associate with him or take up the things that he was talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A comparison of the incidence of respiratory diseases amongst Aboriginal people in the Darwin or Arnhem Land areas with the incidence Australia-wide shows that Aboriginal people are 10 times more likely to suffer from respiratory diseases. That has not changed despite the fact that about half of the Northern Territory is now inalienable land title held by Aboriginal people. The government's effort has not changed that. Infectious diseases are probably 10 or 20 times greater amongst Aboriginal people than they are in the general community. Even circulatory diseases&mdash;heart and related diseases&mdash;which are supposed to be something of a problem of our modern lifestyle, are four or five times worse in Aboriginal communities in northern Australia than they are amongst non-Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am appealing to the government to get its act together. It needs to get its facts right. I believe that the opposition has done that. We do not believe that the government can solve these problems. It cannot prove to us that it is serious about dealing with Aboriginal problems of health and education&mdash;high mortality rates and infectious diseases. There are other things that we ought to be doing something about. However, the government cannot prove to us that its intention with this land fund brings it even close to the objective of dealing with the difficulties confronted by the Aboriginal communities of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aboriginal people themselves have some wonderful ideas about what governments should be doing. This is not about the acquisition of land. If the government wants to do something about the Aboriginal regard and feeling for the land, why does it not do something about the homeless Aboriginal kids and try to get them up into areas where there is land?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a place called Clump Mountain&mdash;and I do not believe the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) has ever been there&mdash;where homeless Aboriginal youth and children are brought into the rainforest environment. There, amongst their Aboriginal friends, they experience for the first time something of their heritage. That group is battling all the time to get money, battling all the time to do something for kids who are homeless. However, the government is just going to spend more money on land. It does not care about the homeless kids. It does not care about Clump Mountain and the fact that the people there have not got enough funds to keep going. That does not worry the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is unconcerned about such things. It just wants to buy the land, give the money, buy desert. It believes that people are going to be healthy if they are given desert to eat, that people are going to be better off if they are put out in the saltbush and spinifex country and told to get well. The government has got some amazing healing techniques and some real understanding of medical science!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the Fred Hollows of this world would turn in their graves if they understood precisely what the government is doing. The government's approach is to give Aboriginal people sandhills and spinifex. That will make the Aboriginal people happy! That will give them a spiritual home! That will solve their problems! That will get them jobs! That will get them education! That will get them health!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble is that members of the Labor Party cannot see past the immediate friends that they have&mdash;the Labor Party structures and the legal firms that do the deals on behalf of their friends. The process in this bill is to put $200 million down. It will be paid. Then $121 million will be paid each year for nine years. That is one billion dollars being paid out which is not going to produce any more effect than the $20 billion that has been paid to Aboriginal communities over the last 20 years. The health standards, educational standards, housing standards and opportunities for Aboriginal people have not changed, even though programs have been running for 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the last 11 years the Australian Labor Party has been in charge of the program and it has had no impact, no effect, whatsoever. There is a demonstrable link between health and medicine, not between health and land. The opposition has said, `Use that money.' We believe it should be committed on behalf of the Australian people, but we believe that it should be committed for definite purposes that the government has not set out in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has not said that we need to focus on Aboriginal health problems, Aboriginal housing problems, Aboriginal educational and economic issues&mdash;that is, jobs. The government has refused to acknowledge that. What the government has done is said that it will buy land. In this legislation, the opposition is agreeing with the government&mdash;let us allocate these funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a time when we are coming out of a recession, when most Australians have had a harsh time, when most people have felt the pinch of the last five years of Labor Party management, we are prepared to say, `Let's spend this money on the Aboriginal people,' but we are also saying, `Let us direct it to better areas than those proposed by the government. Let us refocus it on health, housing, education and jobs.' We also consider that there needs to be an accountability process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the public are in the gallery. It is very interesting that the government never seems to want to have debates such as this given extended broadcasts. I always wonder whether it is concerned that it does not want the flimsy arguments that it presents here to be heard by the rest of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The few people who are favoured to travel to Canberra and to sit in the gallery and to understand what is going on know the truth. The government prefers to hide and to screen these facts from fellow Australians. People listening to the debate will understand that the accountability processes have been poor. The Australian Labor Party has also sought to screen that from the public. Whether it was amongst the bureaucrats in ATSIC when it first started, whether it was amongst the bureaucrats in the land councils or anywhere else in the Aboriginal system, it has considered it to be critical of the Aboriginal people if mistakes have been made. Nobody is critical of honest mistakes. What people are critical of are fraud and rip-offs. We can go anywhere in Australia and see where the smart alecs have been and the trail they have left behind of abusing the funds that the Australian people have put towards the Aboriginal community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have got Auditor-General's report after Auditor-General's report on these areas. There are parasites and bloodsuckers in the system. When I was in the north, the royalties had just been paid into Groote Eylandt. A couple of entrepreneurial car dealers from Darwin towed a barge full of new Toyotas to Groote Eylandt and the lot were flogged off. I guess that is entrepreneurial but I think in some ways it is a shame when that occurs and funds are spent in that way. But it is the Aboriginal people's right. If it is their dough, they have got a right to spend it the way they want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this government seems to say is that it does not care about accountability. It does not want people to be able to say, `I, with integrity, have done this and I'm prepared for anyone to look through the books at what I've done.' I have met Aboriginal people who are distressed that that seems to be the attitude of the government. If something is Aboriginal, there is a different standard and therefore it does not matter. They are proud people. They are proud of the standards that they want to set. They want to have good standards and they want to be known for their integrity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has said that land purchasing and management strategies must be accountable to the government; in purchasing land, priority must go to those areas where Aboriginals cannot claim native land title. There is a sensible attitude to land purchase. The upgrading of Aboriginal pastoral properties is important. Looking at the cattle count out of the Northern Territory and the kill rate out of the territory, we would have to say that cattle properties in the Northern Territory are not as successfully managed now as they were 20 years ago. There needs to be an upgrading of properties and a building of expertise and skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue that is flagged by the coalition in regard to the land title legislation is that we have to exclude the possibility of native title on land purchases. Land purchase must retain the condition of leasehold or freehold under which it is purchased. People must be actual owners of the property, not through some remote corporation or commission or group of individuals acting on their behalf. It is the height of paternalism to say that Aboriginal people cannot own land in their own right. That is what the government is building into this legislation&mdash;complete and absolute paternalism. The very thing that it cries out against it is building into the structures of the laws of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary secretary is frowning. He knows that is right. He knows that no Aboriginal legislation that the government has put through this parliament has encouraged people to stand with dignity in their own right as individuals. The government prefers to have them controlled through some central group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other areas that have been raised by the coalition are significant too. They explore the options to identify land in which the acquisition group has a financial interest in order to protect innocent third party purchasers, and to find a mechanism for states to nominate a member to the board. I think that is reasonable. The state or territory governments ought to be involved in this process as they have had far more experience in the management and use of Aboriginal lands than the Commonwealth has, and there ought to be assistance for the economic development of land so that practices continue that are beneficial to the people who ultimately own the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the reasons for the coalition deciding that the government is doing the wrong thing for Australia. The government is not benefiting the Aboriginal people in large numbers. It is spending a lot of money where it could gain much more benefit for the Aboriginal people if it were a bit more thoughtful. The fact is that the government would rather support structures and people who support it politically than take some of the hard decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a great respect for the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), but when he was the minister responsible for Aboriginal affairs he could not break the stranglehold of the bureaucrats who are favoured by the Labor Party.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with some pleasure that I take the opportunity to make some comments in the debate today on the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill. At the outset I say that the amendments proposed by the opposition to this bill aim to get the government to widen its focus to take in not just the ownership of land by the Aboriginal community but also the more pressing social needs. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) at the table is continually stressing to the opposition the need for social justice. As far as opposition members are concerned, the social needs of the Aboriginal community in respect of health, housing and education&mdash;the real needs&mdash;are higher priorities than land. Land will not provide for those needs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the representatives of the government have had a fair bit to say about how they have been the great advocates for the indigenous people of Australia, how they have bettered the circumstances of the indigenous people of Australia. I ask government members to cast their minds back to a current affairs program that I took part in&mdash;I think earlier this year&mdash;which featured the then Senator Richardson, who I think was the then health minister, and who was doing a bit of a tour around the Northern Territory and outback Queensland looking at the conditions that a lot of Aboriginal people were living under in their communities. I believe there was also another expose on television last night that indicated that some of our indigenous Australians are living in some fairly exceptional circumstances of extreme cold in the winter and extreme heat in the summer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I am making is that this government has been sitting on its side of this House for about 10 or 11 years, yet our indigenous Australians are still living under the same conditions today. What has the government been doing for indigenous Australians for those 10 or 11 years as far as health, housing and education are concerned? The simple answer is: not enough. The people of Australia, particularly its indigenous people, should not be fooled by a lot of the rhetoric that comes from the government benches when they start talking about the social justice packages that have been introduced to improve the circumstances of indigenous Australians. Why are we just starting to see what is supposedly some action in that direction at this late stage in this government's incumbency on the government benches?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Australia should ask some questions about this important issue. Why has more not been done sooner? Why is there not more in this bill to improve the circumstances of those people? The amendments that were foreshadowed by the shadow minister, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), in her speech to the House yesterday certainly will go further, if agreed to by the government, to address those key issues than the bill does as presently drafted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If enacted, the bill will establish a new land fund called the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund. That fund will take over the money allocated to the land fund established by the Native Title Act. Section 201 of the Native Title Act will be repealed. One of the reasons for setting up a new land fund was that the fund established by section 201 restricted the money to be spent on land management to those properties acquired under the fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new land fund allows money to be spent on land management for any indigenous held properties, whether acquired under the land fund or not. The new land fund is also placed within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 rather than under the Native Title Act, and its detail is provided for in legislation rather than in regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will establish an indigenous land corporation, or ILC, which will receive an indexed amount from the land fund each year. Up until the 1997-98 financial year, the ILC will only receive an annual indexed sum of $24 million because ATSIC will continue to receive the $21 million it currently uses for land acquisition and management. From the 1997-98 financial year, the full indexed amount of $45 million will be allocated to the ILC. From the 2004-05 financial year, the ILC will receive funds based on the realised real return on the investments of the land fund in respect of the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This money is to be used by the ILC for the acquisition of land or the management of indigenous held land. Land acquired by the ILC is to be granted to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations&mdash;and I emphasise the word `corporations'&mdash;and the ILC is to establish a national strategy and regional strategies for the acquisition and management of land. Once the land has been granted to an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation&mdash;note, again, the word `corporation'&mdash;it cannot be sold or mortgaged without the permission of the ILC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main provisions of the bill propose to amend the ATSIC Act by inserting part 4A, on the Indigenous Land Corporation and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund, into the act. The clause numbers referred to below are the proposed section numbers to be inserted in the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ILC will be established under this act. Its powers and functions are land acquisition, land management, and performance. The bill will establish subsidiaries under the ILC which may perform the same functions as the ILC. The dealings of the ILC in relation to land will include disposal of surplus land, the grant of land by ATSIC to the ILC and so forth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the Prime Minister originally made claims that led Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians to believe that Aboriginal people would have almost $1.5 billion to spend on land. Technically, this may be correct, but the real figure that is available for the purchase of land is $45 million per year, which is going to be indexed, of which $21 million is already available through the ATSIC land fund. Therefore, the only new money available for the purchase of land by Aboriginal people is $24 million per year. This $24 million will not go totally to the purchase of land; some of it will go on administration and some will go on the upgrading of newly bought land and existing Aboriginal properties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In my opening comments, I said that health, housing and education are important. Bureaucrats are designing housing in unsuitable areas. In the report of the Auditor-General dealing with the expenditure of ATSIC funds we have seen a lack of accountability, particularly in the area of community development employment programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In one of the Auditor-General's reports, some $300 million plus was unaccounted for. The majority of people I have talked to do not begrudge the establishment of this fund provided the government ensures that it benefits the people it is supposed to benefit, and that taxpayers' dollars are spent properly so that there is transparency and accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To that end, some of the amendments to be moved by the opposition will address the composition of the ILC board. The coalition would like to see the qualification requirements tightened. At present a situation could arise where no board member has experience in the areas of business, commerce or land management. The coalition also believes that the states should have a nominee on the board to ensure that the land acquisition and management functions of the board are coordinated with the states. If we are responsible about establishing this land fund and the ILC, we will involve the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lack of consultation with the states on the part of the Commonwealth government on the Native Title Act. Anybody who studies the legislative process will know that the shorter the consultative process&mdash;getting the legislation together and talking to the people who will be dealing with it&mdash;the longer the dispute process will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are seeing this occur with the Native Title Act now. There are challenges coming from a number of different directions. Because the government rushed the legislation through and did not use a proper consultative process, the National Native Title Tribunal has recommended amendments. We are urging the government to use a proper consultative process and to involve the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition will be moving specific amendments during the consideration in detail stage. As foreshadowed earlier, we wish to change the focus of the bill so that, when the ILC purchases land, it shows that there will be an improvement in health, housing and the economic wellbeing of the Aboriginal community for whom the land is purchased. There is no point in just purchasing large tracts of land and saying, `That belongs to that particular corporation or organisation.' There must be quantifiable benefits in those key areas for the people for whom the land is being purchased and those benefits must be demonstrable to the rest of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, health, housing and education are key areas and need to be addressed. We believe that, during its 11 years on the treasury bench, the government has been remiss in addressing them. It is incumbent on the government, since it has reached this stage in the process, to address those areas of concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important area that I would like to comment on is the ownership of the land to be purchased. We hear a lot of talk in this place about rights. It is my firm belief that there is no such thing as rights without responsibilities in this country; they must be intrinsically linked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the consideration in detail stage of this bill we will be moving an amendment which will allow the fund to include individual ownership of land. At present, this bill allows for ownership of land only by corporations. As I said at the beginning of my address, the bill contains a lot of reference to ownership of land by corporations. However, it should also contain reference to individual ownership of land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that families, individuals, trusts and Aboriginal partnerships should benefit from this fund and should be able to use moneys from the fund in a wide variety of ways in order to set up businesses. These businesses could include ecotourism businesses, but it would not be limited to them. There is a whole range of possible businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no reason why this legislation should not include individuals and families instead of just corporations. There is no reason why Aboriginal people should differ from other Australians in this respect. This again identifies the lack of bona fides on the part of the government in addressing some of those key issues facing the Aboriginal community today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before this bill goes to the other house, I would like to see far greater emphasis placed on the need for better health services, improved health conditions, improved housing conditions and better education for Aboriginal people in Australia. This land fund must be accountable. It needs to be far more transparent and far more accountable. As has been borne out in numerous reports, billions of dollars have been disbursed by ATSIC over previous years. The former head of ATSIC, Dr Peter Shergold, told us that ATSIC had been done to death with inquiries. Do members of the government not realise why ATSIC has been done to death with inquiries? It is because there has not been enough accountability or transparency with respect to the expenditure of the funds that have been allocated to ATSIC by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There must be far greater accountability of this land fund. There needs to be a certain level of expertise on the board of the corporation so that its functions can be disbursed in a diligent manner and so that the activities of the corporation can be balanced. They are absolutely fundamental to our responsibilities, as members of this parliament representing the people of Australia, with respect to the expenditure of taxpayers' funds. It is not just in this area that we must show that sort of diligence; it is in every area of the expenditure of taxpayers' funds in Australia. So the government must recognise the need for improvement in that area of this bill. We believe that the ownership of the land should not just be vested in a corporation. Other types of ownership should be included in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I implore members of the government to have an open mind and not to run out of here like the Prime Minister did the other day. He bagged the opposition's amendments before he even knew what they were, and I think he is still doing it. He has been crowing about trying to establish a bipartisan position on this issue for quite some time. It is time that the Prime Minister had an open mind and took a serious look at the amendments being proposed by the opposition to see how the legislation can be improved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said in this place before, all the wisdom and the knowledge in this place does not belong to that side of the House. There is a fair amount on this side of the House. Certainly, all the knowledge and wisdom on a number of different issues across Australia is not resident in this chamber. There is a lot outside this place. I urge the government to lengthen the consultative process and to talk to the states at length about the possible outcomes and ramifications of this piece of legislation as it travels through this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First and foremost, I urge the government to keep in its mind the health, housing and education issues that certainly need addressing now, as they did 10 years ago when this government came to power. We do not seriously believe that the government has done enough in those areas for the Aboriginal or indigenous Australians whom we are seeking to help with this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did something today that I never did in my six years as a minister&mdash;with some pride, the longest serving minister in Australian Aboriginal affairs history, I am told by the Parliamentary Library&mdash;for this speech and that was to work out how much money you are entitled to if you are of Aboriginal descent in Australia on top of what you are entitled to as an Australian. It is quite an interesting exercise. I got the figures from the library and I did them myself separately. They have worked out the same, so I accept that $1.6738 thousand million is expended on Aboriginal affairs in Australia by the federal government. At the recent AAAC&mdash;Aboriginal ministers conference&mdash;it was claimed that $327 million was being spent by the states. I suspect that the figures may be inflated somewhat, but all the same they were the official figures presented by the various state governments so I think we have to accept them. They do not make a great deal of difference to the overall figure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then look at the number of people of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander decent in Australia&mdash;265,492&mdash;and we find that each person of Aboriginal decent is entitled to $6,204 and that a family consisting of two adults and two children is entitled to $25,226. If we add to that the social security entitlement of a man out of work with a wife and two kids, the absolute bare minimum he can get off the government is another $17,134. That is $42,360. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can add to that figure the value of a housing subsidy, which is about $3,900 a year&mdash;probably a little bit more, but that is about as accurate a figure as we can secure here&mdash;and the fact that some 20,000 of those people of Aboriginal decent are employed and receiving an income, and in some cases very substantial incomes. For example, my former boss, a foreman at the lead smelter at Mount Isa Mines, is of Aboriginal decent and he earned a very substantial income. A lot of Aboriginals are working as plant operators in the coalfields and as schoolteachers in North Queensland. A lot of them are working in hard jobs, very poorly paid jobs, ringing and fruit picking in North Queensland and some people have very good and lucrative jobs on the railways in North Queensland as engine drivers, for example, some of whom are good close friends of mine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we add in, let us say, around $2,648, the average person of Aboriginal decent in Australia on the dole should be getting, if that money were going into his pocket, $50,140. That makes him reasonably all right&mdash;not rich, but reasonably all right: let us say, upper middle income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is the case that people of Aboriginal decent are getting $50,000, I would like to find out where they are because I most certainly have not seen them. As a minister for six years with this responsibility on my shoulders, there is not the slightest doubt in my mind&mdash;to quote former senator Neville Bonner&mdash;that $3 out of every $4 that is spent on Aboriginal affairs ends up in white pockets. That, of course, is profoundly true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, I am told that the person whose place I took in this chamber was on some $60,000 or $70,000 a year as an Aboriginal legal aid lawyer in Mount Isa. I do not know whether that is true or not, but I most certainly think that Aboriginal legal aid lawyers are on very substantial salaries. Many of them, of course, are serving an apprenticeship before they get an ALP endorsement into this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If these people are earning this money, why do we have these horrific unemployment levels, and why do we have these horrific statistics for health and life expectancy? Almost every indicator is something for all of us to be utterly ashamed of. The question is: why is this the case, if money can solve the problem? We are here today discussing pouring even more money into what appears to be a bottomless pit. If the money were yielding some purpose, I would not mind. Mena Phillips, an excellent officer in the department I was responsible for and a friend of mine from schooldays, claimed that we are worse off now than we were 15 years ago. I believe that that is true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about buying more land in Queensland for people of Aboriginal descent. The people of Aboriginal descent in Queensland are beneficial owners of the land. Thanks to the socialists, they are no longer the legal owners. Under us they were the legal owners and the beneficial owners. In other words, the old period of Big White Bwana returned in Queensland under the socialists when they took away the legal ownership of the land and reinvested it in the state government. This occasioned the worst demonstration at the Queensland Parliament House in the history of the parliament. Some 3,000 or 4,000 people turned out. </PARA>

If you look at land ownership, you see that these people, some 25,000 or 30,000 people on what were once called the reserve areas of Queensland&mdash;we can even take all of the people of Aboriginal descent in Queensland, some 70,000&mdash;own some seven million acres of land. Almost all of it is land which gets above 40 inches of rainfall. We are not talking about barren land or the useless land they have been given in the Northern Territory; we are talking about prime real estate. In fact, the Yarrabah community area would be worth many hundreds of millions of dollars. It neighbours the city of Cairns and would be some of the most valuable real estate in all of Australia. We are talking about the most land-rich people on the planet. So why do these problems still exist? We can see clearly, with what has happened with the state government in Queensland, why we have this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I often stand up here and criticise my own side of the House, but today I was very proud to listen to the speeches, because what they said was, `For heaven's sake, give the people the same ownership rights and privileges that every other Australian enjoys.' As the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), from Western Australia, said, we should let these people have a go and let them own their own land. If you cannot mortgage your own land and you cannot raise any money to do anything with it, it is worth absolutely nothing to you. All the speeches from the other side were characterised by this sanctified relationship between the black people and the land. Each one of them gave the same holy and pious speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I heard it one night from somebody who was arguing with a person. That person said, `You can talk about all that sort of rubbish, but at the end of the day they will be going to the disco on Friday night and busting their britches to see the Sydney rugby league on Saturday afternoon.' I thought, `This bloke knows what he is talking about.' I took the trouble of ringing up and finding out who he was. His name was very obscure to me; I had never heard of him before. He was a bloke called Fred Hollows. I sent him a letter and said, `Congratulations. You are the first person I have ever seen on the television who seems to know or understand anything about the real people who are out there.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We had to try to convince some of the people dealing with black affairs in the old reserve areas in Queensland to take over the running of their own communities. It was called self-management or local government, although it was probably a lot more than that. Many of them were very fearful. Many of them had a driving determination to seize control of the running of their own affairs. But some were sensible, moderate, quiet people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember one of them&mdash;Jackson Shortjoe. I have a picture of him on a wall in my office to this very day. Jackson, a very quiet bloke&mdash;he was an ex-ringer on the Peninsula&mdash;got up and said, `I do not know whether your arguments that we do not know how to run our own affairs are correct or whether we should listen to the minister and some of you other blokes and say that we can learn on the job. But I know this: if we don't have a go, we don't get our pride back. Without our pride, we are finished as a race of people. We will drink ourselves to death and we will no longer exist.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In my last year as minister only six of the 28 councils in Queensland had qualified audit reports. Four of the six councils in the Torres Strait were tiny. Many of these people had difficulty speaking English and could not read or write. They were running their own affairs without any interference. In fact, there was a memo that any officials who interfered in any way with the running of the local shires would lose their jobs. In fact, three did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> These people were able to take in $30 million and spend it. The Auditor-General for Queensland said that they were running things well. When I left, we had an income of $15 million from private operations. Today, almost every one of those councils is getting qualified audit reports. They believe that there is a plot by the state government to break their confidence in running their own affairs. I treated these charges flippantly in days gone until I became the minister and I saw up close the workings of the white public servants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember the classic case of Greg Wallace, who was the first black shire clerk in Queensland's history. He took over the chief executive job at Weipa South. He got the people working for the dole voluntarily. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> did a whole segment on it.

Democracy is being undermined by the people who really have as their basis the idea that they know how to run things better than the black people do. I carry to every office I have ever had a picture of Jackson Shortjoe, whom I referred to before, and Eddie Holroyd, who was the subject of yet another <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes </EMPHASIS>series, and theirs is the greatest success story I know of. Eddie Holroyd had taken his own block of country from the reserve area. He owned it in just the same way as any other pastoralist in Queensland. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes </EMPHASIS>showed a picture of his yard, which was nearly two acres, and those honourable members involved in cattle would know that a two-acre yard is a very big yard. Every single piece of wood on Eddie Holroyd's property was ironwood, which Australian timber books agree is the premier timber in Australia. He had scoured all of the area so that every single piece of wood was ironwood. The pieces of timber were so big that I do not know how even two men could have carried them; I think three men would have been needed to carry each of those logs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eddie Holroyd was a supreme achiever. In this black run area, Jackson Shortjoe and he started with 326 cattle on the books when self-management and private ownership came in and, within a period of 4 1/2 years, Pormpuraaw as it is now called had over 6,000 head of cattle on the books. Those blokes climbed into the saddle&mdash;there was no white bloke on the reserve at all&mdash;and chased down those wild cattle, which no-one else had ever been able to do, and put together 6,000 head of cattle. </PARA>

I said, `Danny, don't let them shoot your cattle. That's the kids' future.' He said, `That is why I am ringing you up.' He cried on the telephone to me because the last of their 12,000 head of cattle were being shot by the white people; the servants of this government were shooting the last of that area's future.

George Rosendale said, `Bobby, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Department of Community Service come into Hopevale and say that they are going to build all these beautiful houses for us, that this is progress and that Hopevale is now a really lovely place.

George Rosendale said, `When they come to Hopevale and build all of these beautiful houses, that is not progress, Bobby. What I am doing here is progress.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That money can be used in urban situations. I will close my remarks with one example. The Aitkenvale reserve, which is right in the centre of Townsville, is some 20 acres of land owned by black people. I am afraid that anyone who says that they do not own it is wrong. It must be handed over to the Aboriginal people. The program relating to the Aitkenvale reserve was drawn up by the black people. Under that program a building group was to come in and build houses, then flog off the land with the houses so that they would be able to start their own construction company, employing some 50 or 60 men. Those construction crews were already working for us under contract to build houses. I am talking about houses built to a standard that is acceptable anywhere in the world. They are excellent houses. In fact, their brickwork was probably superior to that of any other brickwork in North Queensland. There are 70 permanent jobs there; there is the leagues club and the shopping centre strip in the front.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recognise the enthusiasm of my colleague the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter). As a former state minister for Aboriginal affairs, he has a great knowledge of the Aboriginals and I know that they respect him for the work he did in Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to be able to make a short contribution to the debate on the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill before question time and to confirm once again&mdash;despite the attempts of the government to muddy the water&mdash;that the opposition wants to see this bill go through the parliament so that the formalisation of legislation to assist in the acquisition of certain land for the Aboriginal people can be effected. The principle of the bill is supportable, but the bill requires some amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is good to see that there are young Australians in the gallery at the moment. They are obviously visiting the parliament from schools throughout Australia. I extend a warm welcome to them and hope they enjoy their visit. It is great for them to be in the parliament today to witness some of the debate on this legislation which attempts to bring the parties together to achieve a bipartisan approach to help the Aboriginal people find happiness, security and peace in Australia as citizens of Australia. We all know that there is a lot of work to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing that strikes me most about the debate so far is that yesterday, when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) was presenting in broad terms the opposition's wish that the bill go through subject to amendments, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and other members of the government frontbench were interjecting and indicating that, somehow or other, this was a trick on the part of the coalition. That was before they had heard the Leader of the Opposition complete his speech and it was certainly before the government knew anything about the nature of the amendments that the coalition was going to suggest to both houses of parliament to improve the legislation and to ensure that the government achieved its objectives with sound legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard the word `trickery' being called across the chamber. It did the government no credit to expose itself in such a blatant way to a political strategy that was clearly designed to give the impression that this parliament was not prepared to resolve the challenges for Aboriginal people in a bipartisan way. The government reflected yesterday its disappointment that the coalition had decided that it could support the legislation with certain amendments. That probably launched the debate in a very sorry direction. I hope that the government today, with a bit of sober reflection, will take a different view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), who is at the table, knows a bit about conflict resolution. It is a matter that I have been interested in for many years, both as a practising legal practitioner and also as a member of parliament. The only way to resolve matters of importance and substance is for the parties to stop calling each other names and to sit down and listen to each other. I hope that today the government will listen to the coalition's point of view and that it will pick up some of the coalition's points, because those points have merit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a former state minister, I believe that, if the parliament is offering a minister bringing in legislation the opportunity to improve the performance of that legislation, to ensure that taxpayers' funds are used for the purpose of achieving the objects of the legislation, to ensure that taxpayers' money is fully accounted for, to ensure that the people entrusted with that particular duty have a clear brief as to what they are expected to do and are under no doubt at all about the high standards of the required performance and probity, that opportunity should be welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was a minister, if someone from whatever side of parliament put forward suggestions that would strengthen the legislation that I was responsible for, I welcomed them. That is the way it ought to be. I hope that today the government will start to develop some dialogue with the coalition to look at our amendments, none of which in my view destroy the purpose of the legislation. In my view, our amendments will ensure that the legislation's purpose can be achieved and will endure for the benefit of the Aboriginal people. Above all, they will help the reconciliation process, which is a very urgent matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get this into perspective. One of the amendments in general terms that the coalition is proposing&mdash;obviously we will go into this in more detail at the consideration in detail stage&mdash;will ensure that the objects of helping Aboriginal people are achieved. We have proposed that, when considering the purchase of land, the ILC must show that the health, housing and education needs or economic viability of an Aboriginal community will be improved. I thought that was the government's policy too, quite frankly. I am amazed that the government has allowed itself to publicly give an indication that that proposal is some form of trick. How can it be a trick to want to improve the health and economic prospects of Aboriginal people? How can it be a trick if, in assisting Aboriginal people to acquire land, part of the purpose of the acquisition is to strengthen their future and security, and to assist them to address some of the very serious and sad health problems that we all know exist in parts of the Aboriginal community in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I heard this suggestion I thought that maybe I had not read the bill properly. I re-read the bill, trying not to be too much of a lawyer whilst recognising that it is a bit hard not to look at it from a legal point of view. I thought maybe I had misunderstood the bill. I thought that maybe what we were saying would not mesh in with the bill and that we had better have another look at it. I had another look at the bill and found that on page 3, under the subheading `Purposes of Indigenous Land Corporation', clause 191B states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Indigenous Land Corporation is established:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) to assist Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders to acquire land; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) to assist Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders to manage indigenous-held land&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the coalition supports all of that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">so as to provide economic, environmental, social or cultural benefits for Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders.</PARA>
<PARA>What is wrong with incorporating in that clause, in appropriate drafting terms, the expressions that the coalition wants reinforced as well&mdash;that is, in assisting in the acquisition and management of the land, better health, housing and education for our Aboriginal people must also be achieved?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear. If someone acquires a tract of land where it is expected that some Aboriginal people will make their homes forever, provision has to be made for their housing, in whatever form they prefer, and there has to be decent water. Honourable members on the other side need reminding that a lot of Aboriginal babies die of dysentery and other illnesses because there is not a decent water supply in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I for one, and all the members of the coalition, do not want to see that issue ignored. On behalf of the Australian people, surely to God the government should seize our willingness to incorporate principles along those lines in this legislation. That would be in the interests of everyone, and it is our duty to address these particular matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why would that be trickery? Surely to God the word `trickery' was an aberration, a political expression of disappointment by the government yesterday. I hope that is behind the government now and I hope that the government will enter into dialogue with our shadow minister, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), who has done an excellent job in presenting the case for the coalition supporting the legislation subject to the amendments that we are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other areas of substance in our amendments concern accountability. Why would a minister of the crown not welcome legislation that says, `There's to be proper accountability to ensure probity at all times, to ensure that the taxpayers' money is spent to achieve the purposes of the legislation, to ensure that the interests of the Aboriginal people of Australia are enhanced and strengthened and to ensure a permanent situation which will help resolve some of their problems'? Why would they not want some strengthening of the legislation?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for McEwen is hungry for the knowledge of how to strengthen the legislation. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs is hungry for that knowledge. I think we might have created an environment in which we can have some conflict resolution. It appears the government is now signalling that it does want to sit down and talk. That is good. I look forward to the opportunity, with the shadow minister, to demonstrate to the government how the amendments will strengthen this legislation, how they are responsible and how they will ensure that the objectives of the legislation are achieved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The corporation to be established has very wide functions and powers. It can borrow, it can purchase land, it can dispose of land, it can enter into arrangements, it can grant titles to possession of land&mdash;it can do a wide range of things. Surely it is in the interests of the taxpayer, the Aboriginal people particularly, and all Australians that the function be properly scrutinised and that there be the opportunity from time to time for the elected parliament of Australia over the next 10, 20, 30 or 40 years, whatever it is, to have some input into the regional strategies that are being proposed from time to time by the corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely the government and the minister are not arguing that the elected government, the elected parliament of Australia, should have no input once the bill is enacted and proclaimed into the operation of the regional strategy. That is nonsense. Equally, if we are going to help the reconciliation process, surely the government sees the merit in putting into the bill provisions requiring the corporation to consult with state and local government where appropriate. What is wrong with that? If you are going to make it work, you have to do that. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said simply this: in terms of this year's budget, there is absolutely no need for us to think about revising the budgetary policy. It is totally appropriate to our circumstances. The government has no intention whatever of revisiting its budget policy prior to the next budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of every budget, the government reassesses the appropriateness of its budget strategy. All I have said is that, in those circumstances, if we believed that there was some need for further tightening of fiscal policy, then we would do so. We would make our assessment at that time of the appropriate budget policy that we needed to be pursuing. If we thought the deficit reduction strategy needed to be improved upon, then we would improve upon it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a sensible position for the government to take. We should also bear in mind that the deficit reduction strategy that is in place does involve a quite substantial reduction in that budget deficit. Between 1993-94 and 1997-98 there will be a reduction of almost three per cent of GDP, 2.8 per cent, and that is a very substantial reduction of the budget deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of reducing the budget deficit is in the context of an economy which is producing substantial growth, particularly with increasing investment. The opposition has been in the curious position of saying that there is not going to be any increase in investment and at the same time telling us that we have to dramatically increase the rate of reduction of the budget deficit to improve our savings, which would not be necessary if we were not having any investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reduction in the budget deficit of about 2.8 per cent over that period is substantial and, if business investment moved up from where it is now as a percentage of GDP from 8.9 per cent as of today in the national account figures to its long-term average around 11 1/2 per cent, then we would need to improve our savings performance. Clearly, on the basis of the budget deficit reduction that is already in the forward estimates, we would more than cover that with the improving savings by reducing public sector dissavings through the deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no argument at all about the inappropriateness of the budget deficit at this time. Clearly, that is a matter for us to consider over time. When we get to next year's budget, we will see whether we need to tighten it further. Until then it is a pointless argument. In the context of our already having in place that substantial deficit reduction strategy, and certainly enough to cope with a large increase in business investment without the need to recourse to foreign savings, there is simply nothing in the point that the opposition is trying to make.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer, and I refer to the national accounts figures for the June quarter published today. Is the Treasurer aware of reports that the national accounts are disappointing? Is there any truth in these reports? What are the implications of the June quarter figures for the current financial year?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="752" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the national accounts released today. I have seen reports that the results are disappointing. In particular, the shadow Treasurer in his interview on the<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> World Today</EMPHASIS> said that they were disappointing. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that the figures are disappointing. They are disappointing for the opposition but absolutely to the contrary for everybody else. These are very good figures, which give us an increase in GDP in the June quarter of 0.9 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point about disappointment comes from the fact that this compares with a two per cent increase in the March quarter. A two per cent increase in one quarter is a phenomenal increase. As we pointed out at the time, there were some one-off factors in that which meant that we were not saying that we were growing at two per cent per quarter, eight per cent a year or more. The one-off factors particularly related to the early Easter&mdash;bringing forward retail sales from what would normally have been in April into March and therefore into the March quarter and giving a very large kick along to private consumption figures in that quarter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was the main one-off factor, but there were others. Those things have unwound in the June quarter. So we are seeing some fallback to a rate of 0.9 per cent in the June quarter. That is no reason for us to think that growth is declining and things are grim or disappointing. On the contrary, they show that over the 12 months we have had growth of 4.3 per cent on seasonally adjusted figures, which is certainly very strong growth, and better than almost any other country in the Western world and, on a trend basis, 4.6 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are very substantial growth figures indeed and mean that the economy is clearly growing in the order of 4 1/4 to 4 1/2 per cent. We not only have that strong growth of the economy but also we have strong growth of employment, with growth of 300,000 jobs in the last 12 months. We also have inflation which is very low, on the CPI, at 1.8 per cent. On today's national accounts figures, the implicit price deflator for gross domestic product, which is a broad based index trying to cover everything in the economy, shows a 0.9 per cent increase, an inflation rate of less than one per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is clearly nothing in these figures which gives any indication that we have other than an extremely comforting position&mdash;strong growth of output, strong growth of employment and very low levels of inflation. That is an exceedingly good position for the nation to be in. Most other countries looking at these figures can only look on with enormous envy at an outcome of this kind. They are also absolute confirmation of the budget forecast, which was for 4 1/2 per cent growth of gross domestic product. We are already around that rate and, with business investment getting under way, we clearly are going to have another impetus to growth occurring in 1994-95 that we have not had to this stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a rolling recovery where different factors are coming into play at different times. As dwelling investment drops down a little, and as government impetus to the economy drops back, business investment is coming on and continuing our progress towards continued strong growth of the economy and strong growth of employment. Whilst we can continue to keep inflation at these low levels, which we certainly intend to do, there is no reason why we cannot go on chalking up these sorts of outcomes for several years to come.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government's approach to savings is that we agree that the budget deficit has to be reduced over time. I have already been through that in answer to the earlier question from the Leader of the Opposition. That course is a major pro-savings policy.

We will not pursue that course unless we are quite convinced that what we are doing is going to be a net addition to national savings and not just something which gives the mirage of increased savings on the one hand but ignores the fact that there is a great hole in savings on the other hand. There is every chance that that would be the outcome.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The provision of income support to homeless young people is a matter that has attracted a good deal of public attention of late, some of it extraordinarily poorly informed. There is undoubtedly a need for such an income support payment for people under the age of 18. While the matter has not been the focus of public attention with the possibility of political gain, I think that has been accepted by most members of the opposition. In 1989 the honourable member for Bradfield, in a parliamentary debate about income support for young people, said this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For heaven's sake, if a child is forced out of his home because he has been beaten by his father, sexually assaulted or something else and is expected to be able to present a piece of paper from his parents saying that he has left home, the absurdity of the circumstances becomes clear. If a child leaves home under those circumstance he needs help. To expect that he can go back to his parents asking for support is absurd.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a reasonably honest statement of the rationale for this particular form of payment. It is not paid willy-nilly. It is made available under a restrictive set of circumstances, particularly in cases of abuse, sexual assault, intolerable domestic circumstances and circumstances where the child is simply not allowed to live at home. There is no doubt that we need to have a payment of this kind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I took over the social security portfolio, there were a lot of expressions of concern about the administration of the payment. As I said, a lot of people were very poorly informed. As a consequence of that, I took a number of steps. I asked the department to do an internal review of the way that payment was administered. A number of concrete things flowed from that; in particular, the gazetting of a new privacy instrument under the Social Security Act that should broaden significantly the circumstances in which parents can be contacted, particularly when it will facilitate family reconciliation and it will keep the parents informed of what is going on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was always the case that parents were contacted in the majority of cases, but the new privacy instrument should ensure that, in the great majority of cases, parents are contacted. There are obviously some cases where there is a degree of threat or the possibility of retaliatory violence that has to be taken into consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing that arose from that consideration was the initiation of a process of negotiation with the states to try to arrive at a protocol or a set of agreements with the states about how young people who approach us and are put on our income support system are dealt with. Clearly, we cannot provide all the support services that such young people need. Many of the care and protection services and the mediation and counselling services and much of the access to health and housing come within the purview of the states.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer. I refer to the business investment figures in today's national accounts which show growth of 0.7 per cent in the June quarter. Does this represent the underlying level of business investment? How does this compare with the budget forecast?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="755" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that the business investment figures that came out today are, on the face of it, very low. We had a figure of 0.7 per cent growth in investment, as the member for Melbourne mentioned in his question. We had a figure of minus 0.6 per cent growth in investment in plant and equipment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those figures are not giving us a true indication of what is happening to business investment for one reason. That reason is the sale of the Gladstone power station in the March quarter. It was a sale of second-hand equipment, in a sense, from the public to the private sector. Once you unwind from that and look at what is happening to new investment in plant and equipment, you get a totally different picture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That different picture shows that in the June quarter there was an increase in business investment in plant and equipment by the private sector of 13.4 per cent. That is the underlying position for business investment. It shows that total business investment increased in the June quarter by 10.7 per cent, which is again abstracting from the sale of the Gladstone power station.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So these are very comforting figures indeed in that they show that business investment is coming on strongly. The capital expenditure figures, which were announced last week, showing the rise in business investment in the June quarter, are in the national accounts for all to see. Of course, those capital expenditure figures show strong expectations of increased business investment in 1994-95. Today's figures, of course, are just further confirmation of the fact that business investment is picking up strongly, and we can therefore expect those budget forecasts, which caused such expressions of disbelief at the time, to be quite achievable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the House that the budget forecast for business investment was a 14 1/2 per cent increase and for plant and equipment it was 18 1/2 per cent. This caused a lot of headlines about gambling on growth. The headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> was `Willis spots Utopia'. I do not want to claim that Utopia has arrived&mdash;I would not be so crass as to do that&mdash;but I can say that the budget forecasts on business investment look very achievable. Given those strong rates of growth in the June quarter, and given the fact that we have that expectation material out there, those business investment figures now look very achievable indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Business investment is picking up under all the influences that we have been pointing to whilst the opposition has been saying, `Nothing's going to happen. It's all heroic assumption. It's dark clouds. This is the great hole in the budget,' et cetera. The great hole they were hoping would arrive is not going to arrive because the fundamentals of the economy are so strong and so conducive to increased business investment that it is no wonder we are now seeing that recovery coming through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the House of the sorts of things which are producing this kind of investment outcome: the strong level of demand, which is there in the national account figures; the low inflation; the low interest rates; the high levels of business confidence; the fact that business is very internationally competitive now and able to export in a way which it could not have conceived 10 years or so ago&mdash;certainly for the manufacturing and service industries that is increasingly so&mdash;the low levels of wage increase; considerable productivity improvement; tax incentives for increased investment by way of the improved depreciation allowances, the investment allowance, the development allowance, the reduction in company tax rates; and the very substantial incentives for industry research and development, which I am pleased to see is now producing considerable increases in private sector research and development expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder we are seeing this investment take off. We can expect in 1994-95 the budget forecasts on investment will be very substantially met, if not exceeded.</PARA>

I went to his electorate, and I feel very sure that I understand all the concerns that were put to me at that time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only delay has been caused by constant requests by members of the opposition, not by public opposition. They cannot make up their own minds on this question and are dying to do something against this legislation but cannot yet find the reason, so they make constant requests for delays. First of all they asked that it go to a House of Representatives committee and a Senate committee. I agreed. Then the new spokesperson for the opposition asked that there be delay in the debate. I agreed. Then they asked for further delay until the next session. I have agreed at every step of the way to every request.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us now go to the amount of opposition on `Made in Australia' that has been referred to. It is alleged often that everyone out there has a view on what `Made in Australia' means. We explained to people that we are not changing the current meaning of `Made in Australia'. We then found that people, particularly in the area which the honourable member for Mallee represents, were terrorised by people who peddled the most misleading information about this legislation. For instance, during a radio interview John Corboy of SPC told people that orange juice that contained imported Brazilian concentrate would be able to be labelled `Made in Australia'. As I pointed out to the Leader of the National Party, as I pointed out to all those people in that electorate, and as people now recognise, under the current law it is illegal. It certainly will still be illegal under the law that is to operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People then say, `Well, there are all these surveys that are being done on it.' Let me go to the surveys. I keep saying, `Show me the surveys.' Surveys were done by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Investigators</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS>, whose reporters walked along the street with a can of jam and a jar of peanut butter and asked their questions in relation to food. Another survey was done on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia All Over</EMPHASIS> through a phone-in by Macka, who asked about food. I clarified the situation for him. The other survey was apparently commissioned by SPC. Every question in the SPC survey related to food. Even that research showed that less than half of those sampled agreed with the position proclaimed as gospel by SPC and its supporters that `Made in Australia' means 100 per cent Australian ingredients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will say&mdash;not for the first time and I am sure not for the last&mdash;that the labelling legislation applies to all consumer goods sold in Australia which make a claim to being Australian.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion. I will not detain the House for long. Mr Acting Speaker, what we have had today in your ruling and in the set piece tactic from the government is a cameo performance in the abuse of question time which, unfortunately, most Australians are now very much used to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Speaker, I will relate the exact details of the question to you as best as I can remember them. The member asked the Minister for Finance about the 1993-94 budget outcomes of something just short of $2 billion being allocated to non-profit organisations. The member then went on to ask whether or not the minister may have received representations to make a payment to the League of Rights organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we all know, this is simply a government tactic to get up and heap abuse on the opposition and to attempt to make some general claim about the political character of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer). That is all it is. It is far removed from this government's obligations in question time. Those obligations are very simple: you are to account to the Australian people for your stewardship of the Australian government. You have consistently&mdash;week in, week out and day in, day out&mdash;taken the opportunity in question time not to do your duty, not to give the Australian people an account of your stewardship of government, but to stand there and tip buckets on the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing in it. We know there is nothing in it. You know that there is nothing in it. In fact, the minister clearly told the story for all to see. As he came to the dispatch box to answer the question, he had a wide smile on his face because he knew that this was a classic plaything of the government in question time. Furthermore, just to reveal the absolute paucity and triviality of this question, we find in the minister's response that he has never received a representation for a payment to the League of Rights. We all know that, just as you would never pay it a cent, we would never pay it a cent either. The whole thing is an absolute joke from start to finish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only serious aspect of the whole thing is this: when confronted with an obvious political ploy, with a question which, in itself, probably breached the standing orders&mdash;we will put that aside; we are used to that&mdash;and with a proper point of order as to whether or not the answer was relevant to a question, and after repeated points of order, you had an opportunity to require the minister to finish his silly little game and to sit down. You ruled that the answer was in order when it was clearly out of order and clearly in breach of the standing orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You ought to have put us beyond the complete waste of time which this question has produced by ruling in favour of the opposition. Furthermore, you ought to have simply had the plain, common, good sense to say to the minister, `It is about time you wound up and sat down.' Mr Acting Speaker, we dissent from your ruling.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) had been in a Munich beer hall in the 1920s, based on our experience of him to this point, he would have said that he was there for the beer. That is precisely the presentation that he has given of himself in this case. He was there with the League of Rights to address a Christian youth group&mdash;that is the interpretation&mdash;and he was there because he was too young; that is, the age of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition leader inspired great energy on the part of the league when he was there because evidently the league felt constrained to write that his speech was followed by `an outstanding action seminar the following day indicating the shape of things to come'. At least in those days he was inspirational; he is having some problem with it now. We had the opposition spokesman on defence, or whatever he is now, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), stand up here today and indicate that the question was part of a ploy; the heckling of the opposition's motion was part of a ploy. In other words, its motion was part of a ploy to get all these matters on the public record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to that, and in answer to the substantive points that allegedly have been raised here on standing orders, quite obviously any matters relating to public expenditure can be addressed to me as Minister for Finance. Any matters associated with representations or potential representations&mdash;it depends on the way in which they are phrased&mdash;can be addressed to me as a minister. Whether or not my answers were within that framework, you would not know, because the only part of the answer that I got out before this motion was moved was a statement as to why I could have expected representations arising from an article. You do not know whether what I was going to say subsequently would come within the standing orders or not, but I would have said manifestly that that particular opening remained within standing orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not surprised that the opposition is treating this matter as it is at the moment. True to the form of that organisation, it has been following a jackboot policy in dealing with its backbench during the course of the last week. Yesterday we saw the performance of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who has been heckling and intervening on this matter. He was talking to the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), who led the opposition for about three or four years, about a `fair cop'. He said, `You've been lurking around the back blocks chatting about our leader. It is a fair cop that you are now removed from the front bench.' When you appear on platforms of the League of Rights and address those matters, it is a fair cop if those matters are raised appropriately in question time. It is a fair cop!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a particularly fair cop when a lot of people on your side of the House have actually spent some time dealing with the League of Rights in their party organisations.

I have been questioned by members of the League of Rights, absolutely.

Nothing is more likely to come before us in this expenditure area than organisations which convey themselves in a manner which suggests they perform an educative task for the public.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, Mr Acting Speaker, before you were placed in a position where your rulings could conceivably have lent weight to an argument about whether or not your ruling on these matters was within the framework of standing orders, this incredibly defensive organisation opposite, which lectures its backbench on the subject of fair cops, managed to get itself on its scrapers and into this place to disrupt the point of my answer when I was very likely to be, and emphatically, within standing orders.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen reports in the Tasmanian media today, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS>, reporting comments from the Tasmanian Premier, Mr Groom, apparently at a schools constitutional convention in Hobart yesterday. The Premier made a number of comments, particularly about the High Court, which to my mind to some extent are offensive to the role of the High Court and to the quality of the justices on the court and simply wrong in terms of the role of the court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the Premier stated that the judges of the High Court are little more than simple political appointees, implying that they operate by way of party political bias. I totally reject that. I think that any member of this House who has any understanding of the role of the High Court or the quality of the judges who make up the High Court would also reject those assertions. I notice that the Tasmanian Law Society has also taken great issue with the Premier on those comments. He then went on to talk about the role of the High Court and made this rather interesting statement. He is  reported in the newspaper as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He said that more and more the High Court was coming down with decisions favouring the commonwealth when its job was to protect the states.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course the High Court's job is not to protect the states. It is not to protect the Commonwealth. The High Court's job in terms of constitutional matters is to determine whether a law of this parliament is within the particular heads of power given by the constitution to this parliament. It is to determine whether laws of a state parliament are inconsistent or not with a valid Commonwealth law and it is to determine whether laws of either the states or the Commonwealth infringe the expressed or implied immunities or guarantees contained in the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fairness to the Tasmanian Premier I should say that in the past he has made some statements about the roles of judges and courts which I can associate myself with. Indeed, as a member of this House, as the former member for Braddon, in speaking to the House on the question of police powers and the appropriate balance between police powers and individual rights, the Tasmanian Premier had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Judges must sharpen their recognition of the importance of the privacy of a person's house and private property and must never allow any powers to be oppressively or unreasonably applied.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on in this same speech to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is always dangerous to make moral judgments, but it is particularly dangerous for officials to make moral judgments about someone's conduct . . . In this country we are governed by the rule of law and not by the prejudices of other people.</PARA>
<PARA>Those statements about the rule of law and the role of courts, unlike his statements yesterday, I think members of this House should heartily agree with. He concluded his speech to this House with this call to arms, if you like:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As members of parliament, we must ensure in dealing with legislation that we never overlook the rights of individuals . . . If we forget the rights of individuals, we shall pay an enormous price.</PARA>
<PARA>These are the comments of the Tasmanian Premier. He might think, at one stage, to apply those fine sentiments, which he expressed so forthrightly to this House, to his current position as Premier of Tasmania and to those offensive laws which still exist within the Tasmanian criminal code.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In actual fact, I am not. You can see why they are still sitting on the opposition benches. They do not know the difference between policy and a rewrite of the tax laws. The simple fact is that this rewrite of the tax laws was announced last year. What I am saying today is that this is the first instalment of that rewrite.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the benefit of the House, I can say that the bill does not read like a normal bill. For the first time in the Commonwealth law, we have used direct personal language. The word `you' is used instead of the formal sort of language that no-one but tax lawyers can comprehend. Importantly, the rewrite of the substantiation provisions of the tax laws has half the number of words.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes a number of changes which will reduce the compliance costs. We have simplified the operation of many of the rules, particularly for log books. We have thrown out unnecessary rules and rules that are hopelessly difficult for taxpayers and have marginal gains for revenue. An example of that is laundry expenses. Currently, people have to keep a diary in which they have to note the number of scoops of washing powder used, the amount of the wash that is work related, the number of washes and the amount of electricity used. All of that is stupid. We have replaced it with a draft law which allows up to $150 with no need for receipts. Some 3 1/2 million taxpayers will benefit from reduced compliance costs due to this measure alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is now available for public consultation before it is introduced into the parliament by the end of the year. Even the honourable member for Curtin, if he wants to, can make a contribution in this regard. It will cover expenses paid after 30 June 1995. In conclusion, the government is determined to lower compliance costs. This is the first instalment in the rewrite of the tax laws which will be in plain English and which will significantly reduce compliance costs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Does the Minister for Social Security agree with the figures in a letter I have from a constituent in my electorate? This family, with one member on a jobsearch allowance of $530.60 per fortnight, pays an annual tax of $447.13 a year after deductions of the tax threshold and the dependent spouse rebate but with the addition of the Medicare levy. However, does the minister realise that this family's tax will now increase by $151.67 a year to $598.80 after the partner allowance is introduced and the dependent spouse rebate is abolished? Does the minister also realise that the introduction of the partner allowance, at $265.30 per fortnight, tips this family over the threshold of $250.85 to be eligible to receive home child-care allowance, even though a single income family earning, say, $100,000 a year would be eligible to receive this grant? Why should the unemployed family be discriminated against in this way? Will you change the legislation to correct these glaring anomalies? Will you also modify your advertising program to make it truthful?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="766" SPEAKER="Baldwin The Hon P.J." NAMEID="MD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SYDNEY" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The restructuring of assistance to families with the introduction of the home child-care allowance is a decision which is overwhelmingly beneficial to low income families. As I pointed out the other day, there is a great deal of misinformation about that. In actual fact, the major beneficiaries or the ones who really stand to gain a lot are people whose taxable income is so low that they cannot benefit fully from the operation of the dependent spouse rebate but will be able to benefit fully from the operation of the home child-care allowance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the introduction of the partner allowance, unemployed couples who receive the partner allowance will not be able to receive the home child-care allowance because of the operation of the income test on the home child-care allowance itself. But the inability to do that will be offset by the availability of a tax rebate for the partner which will effectively protect that partner from having to pay tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I undertake to look at the specific example that the honourable member brings up, but the reality is that the changes we have introduced represent a net increase in Commonwealth budgetary impact of $230 million over and above the dependent with child rate of dependent spouse rebate that it replaces, and that benefit goes overwhelmingly to low income families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since this government has been in office there has been a huge increase in additional family payment or the family allowance supplement that preceded it which is specifically targeted at low income families. For a family with a child below the age of 13, there has been of the order of a 100 per cent real increase in family assistance provided that way. For those with children between the ages of 13 and 15, there has been of the order of a 150 per cent real increase in that targeted assistance for those low income families, including unemployed families. That has taken place as a result of the measures this government has taken. So the basic premise of the honourable member's question that the measures we have taken in the family assistance area disadvantage low income families is demonstrably false; the reverse is true. That is the reality of the case.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Moreton for his question. Last Friday I received the Copyright Convergence Group's final report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Highways to change</EMPHASIS>. That group was established to report back to me on reforms which may be necessary to update the act and to render aspects of it technologically neutral. The group's report advocates the most far-reaching and substantial reform to the Copyright Act in more than a decade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this legislation was enacted 25 years ago the major forms of communication were transistor radios, black and white televisions and a postal service made slow by the transport of the time. A year later, millions watched the moon landing as it happened via satellite. Today, messages and images are transmitted instantaneously on vast information networks which span the globe. Reform of the act is essential to prepare for new satellite and cable TV services and the advent of broadband digital forms of information delivery, often referred to as the telecommunications superhighway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Highways to change</EMPHASIS> contains 15 key recommendations for urgent reform. The two which will be of most interest to members are the introduction of a technologically neutral broad based transmission right and the redefinition of the right to broadcast to bring it into line with the Broadcasting Services Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, members who were watching the National Press Club speech by the member for Lalor, the President of the Labor Party, would have noted that he said that the information industry has represented the single most important area for Australia to focus on in terms of our export growth and the potential for new industry development. I think, in that context, I can only repeat that these new convergence technologies do have exactly that potential to strengthen the local economy and links between Australia and the global economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Senator Cook, is committed to developing the potential of these new convergence technologies with the aim of enhancing our export markets. This government has recognised that Australia must put new communications technology to work to help us overcome the tyranny of distance, which has blighted us as a trading nation in the past. But, of course, as we learn to use new technologies as a tool of trade, we must simultaneously put in place a legal framework to protect our intellectual property products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For their assistance to government and for their timely report for a blueprint of this kind, I would like to congratulate members of the Copyright Convergence Group: Ms Victoria Rubensohn, Professor Mark Armstrong, Peter Banki and Malcolm Colless; and the coordinators of the group, Bridget Godwin and assistant, Marea Allen.</PARA>

<PARA>In May 1994, the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings presented an interim report on the principles relating to radio broadcasting of the proceedings of parliament. The committee advised us about the general principles that should govern broadcasting. Both Houses agreed to the suggested principle that the committee may make determinations on the periods and days of broadcasting in line with those principles. The report stated that the existing principles, which had not been reviewed since the early days of radio broadcasting, need updating to reflect current technical, procedural and community realities. </PARA>

The proposed determinations also provide for the broadcasting of the adjournment debate on radio, bringing it into line with television broadcasting. The motion proposes that the House adopt the general principles recommended by the committee in relation to the radio broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings and that a message seeking concurrence be sent to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to continue the debate on the Student Assistance (Budget Matters) Amendment Bill 1994. The background to this bill is the Student Assistance Act 1973, the principal act, which provides for payments and benefits to be given under Austudy and Abstudy schemes and for loan supplements for tertiary students. All of us in this parliament are aware of the great number of students who access Austudy and Abstudy. About $1.4 billion is spent on Austudy schemes and about $106 million is spent on Abstudy schemes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major amendments to this bill will allow Austudy and Abstudy recipients who receive a benefit during 1995 or a later year to repay the whole or part of that benefit at any time during the year. From 1995, Austudy and Abstudy loan supplements will be available to students who do not qualify for Austudy or Abstudy benefits because they do not meet the requirements of the spouse income test. They will be eligible for the supplements, provided their spouse's income is less than the prescribed amount. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a great need in Australia for people living outside university cities and towns to access education. Over the last few years a large number of people have come to my office to complain about the workings of Austudy. In the past, reports have been tabled in this parliament about the workings of Austudy and some of the difficulties faced by people in this regard. As the shadow minister responsible for this area, I still receive many complaints. People complain about the anomalies of the system, about the inequities and about the lack of justice. That is particularly so in the case of people in rural and regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government claims that it is advocating that Australia should become the clever country. Yet it has placed major financial hurdles in the way of students being able to access educational opportunities. When we look at this legislation and at some of the hurdles, the question arises: who is really disadvantaged by this legislation? It is those who are least able to afford to meet the enormous costs of sending students to upper secondary institutions and particularly to tertiary institutions&mdash;the students themselves and the parents of students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the maximum entitlements under Austudy do not go far when paying for books, and fees such as HECS. It is difficult enough for students and parents in urban areas to make the money spin out. However, for students in rural areas the situation is even more critical. To highlight the importance of this, I move:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House calls on the Government to act as a matter of urgency to investigate the plight suffered by students in rural and remote areas of Australia and to take action to relieve the severe financial pressure being faced by many such students and their families".</PARA>
<PARA>I use this debate to raise the issue in the parliament of the very difficult circumstances in which these people find themselves. I am sure the government appreciates some of the difficulties being experienced out there, but it has failed to address the lack of access that regional and rural students have to tertiary education in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To illustrate the point, by the time a family on average weekly earnings of, say, about $25,000 a year pays tax, it is left with approximately $20,000. In regional and rural Australia there is no access to tertiary facilities. If that family, which is living on a net income of $20,000, has two children going off to university&mdash;that is not an unreasonable expectation&mdash;it will have to find between $15,000 and $18,000 to enable those young people to access tertiary education. Quite a substantial cost is involved when a young person from regional or rural Australia goes away to get a tertiary education. Access is very important to them. This is one of the difficulties for many people living in rural Australia. We must remember the amount of money that is needed for families out there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know the cut-off point for receiving Austudy is about $35,000. If we work through that using the same sort of figuring, taking the net income down to about $25,000 and accepting that a minimum of $15,000 is required for two youngsters to receive a tertiary education, there is $10,000 left for mum and dad and maybe one or two other children. I know a substantial number of families in my electorate who come across that problem. There are hundreds of families around Australia who face those sorts of difficulties. It is time for us to have a very hard look at the disadvantages faced by young people in rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will be welcomed by many who will be able to maximise their entitlement to a loan supplement. But it ultimately widens the poverty trap for students by encouraging them to take out supplementary loans. It lets the government off the hook from making the contributions which it would otherwise be making through Austudy. Students must begin to repay their loan within five years unless their income is below the national average earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An Austudy loan seems a preferable alternative for parents, especially rural parents, when struggling to give their children a good education, but a few years down the track the debt must be paid. In addition, the very people who are likely to take out the Austudy supplement are also likely to incur a HECS debt so that at the end of their study both of these debts are hanging over their heads. In many respects, we are putting off the evil day.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Port Adelaide interjects and says that our overseas debt is falling. The only reason that is falling was that the dollar went up. That slight decrease does not make a lot of difference. The fact is this: about $12 to $14 billion is spent paying for our overseas debt. If Australia had that money to use here within the country, our educational and health facilities would be much better. One of the fundamental reasons why the government is not able to move in this area and do something about it is that its overall economic management strategy is not correct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is concerned that students and parents in rural areas are further disadvantaged by the assets/income test under Austudy. The assets limit is $367,150 or $734,300 for businesses or farms in which the family is substantially engaged. It seems a gross injustice that properties or farms are included under the Austudy assets test, whereas a family home on up to two hectares of surrounding domestic land that is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions, in urban areas is exempt from the assets test. There are hundreds of homes in urban areas which are very substantial assets, but people out in the country areas are a long way from anywhere and find it very difficult. This parliament is very much aware at the moment of the effect of drought on these families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have comments from three people to illustrate the effects of the drought. Peter is one such person who cannot get Austudy because of family assets. He was forced to sell cattle because of drought and interest rates. Slowly, the numbers are building up but the income is very low. He had to withdraw from university to work to raise money to continue. That is a real hardship for young people in regional and rural Australia. That is one of the great disadvantages faced by many of the productive young people and their families out in rural Australia. I believe there is a great need for us as a parliament to address this very important issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Carina is another person who cannot get Austudy because of her parents' assets. Her parents cannot support her at university. She lives 370 kilometres from Townsville. Her TE score was 925, and she wanted to do physiotherapy or law. She is now a part-time ringer and is on the dole part time. That is the reality for many of our young people in rural and regional Australia. If we canvassed some of the drought affected areas in New South Wales and in Queensland, we would find hundreds of such cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give just one more example. Jenny was also refused Austudy because of the assets test. At present, she is unemployed and living at home. Her father was not able to support her while she studied. As I said, I could go on with hundreds of these examples of young people who are unable to get access to Austudy because of the assets test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rural people may have assets that ostensibly are valued at hundreds of thousands of dollars on paper but, given the bleak situation for farmers, who will buy them? It is all very well for the government to say, `These people have substantial assets,' but no doubt the assets have been valued at a time when they were worth much more than they are in the present period of drought. Yet these young people are still missing out on access to education. They often have assets that could not realistically reap any financial return and they have very little disposable income. This is one of the greatest anomalies and inequities of the Austudy system and, undoubtedly, it disadvantages rural students. People in urban areas who may have a considerable investment in an elaborate house and may not be as needy as those in rural areas are often eligible for Austudy at the expense of their rural counterparts who own property which makes them ineligible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inequities under Austudy undoubtedly serve to disadvantage rural students, and this is reflected in participation rates, particularly at the tertiary level. In 1993 the DEET report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Going on to university</EMPHASIS> drew the conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that some areas of imbalance have been uncovered. It appears that students outside the metropolitan area apply for places and receive their offers at much the same rate as metropolitan students, but are then more likely to defer or take no action on their offer. The country students we interviewed highlighted problems of travel, accommodation and finance.</PARA>
<PARA>A study of the Australian Council for Educational Research entitled `Entering higher education in the 1980s' was published last year and stressed that, because most institutions of higher education are located in the major cities, enrolling in higher education imposes a greater burden on those from rural areas for at least the reason that non-family accommodation provisions must be written into the equation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The study further says that the effects of these participation patterns on the composition of student populations ensure the over-representation of students from urban backgrounds. The report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rural education crisis</EMPHASIS>, which focused on tertiary participation rates in Victoria, supported this evidence when it showed that only 2.3 per cent of rural students participated in tertiary education compared with 6.9 per cent in the inner Melbourne metropolitan area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am convinced that the disadvantage and inequities that rural people encounter regarding eligibility for, and the amount of, Austudy entitlement is a major factor in the disproportionate number of urban students compared with rural students attending upper secondary and, to a significant degree, tertiary education. Evidence suggests that those rural students who manage to overcome the financial hurdles and go on to tertiary education perform as well as, if not better than, their urban counterparts. Once rural students become eligible to enter higher education, other things being equal, they participate at somewhat higher rates. This may well be because, where rural students are extremely capable, families are prepared to make all sorts of sacrifices for them to continue their education. It might also reflect that the most capable students have been beneficiaries of scholarship programs through industry. Whatever the reasons, many hundreds of other rural students would be capable of success at tertiary education if given the opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rural groups complain that taxation laws allow for averaging of incomes but that the Department of Social Security does not. Rural people were looking forward to the government keeping its 1993 budgetary promise to waive the assets test for those people holding a health care card so that they would qualify for the maximum rate of Austudy, but they were relentlessly duped by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are presently suffering a rural crisis in Australia. Drought conditions cover most of Queensland and central western New South Wales. The farmers and business people from these drought stricken areas are struggling to survive while their dreams for the future lives and education of their children are shattered. Many students in rural areas suffer because of the lack of inequity in regard to access and financial assistance, but they also face many other difficulties, such as isolation. They do not have access to the cultural facilities that many of our young people do in urban areas. They do not have the libraries and the diversity of cultural activities available to people in cities and towns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local employment is much more difficult to get. Incomes on average are lower. Teachers are less experienced and their turnover is far greater for rural students. So right from the very start our rural young people, people from regional Australia, are getting a really tough, raw deal in their education. Ultimately, this often leads to our young people not having the confidence to move away from home. It is not just financial matters that affect their education&mdash;there are many other aspects to the problems they face, and it virtually starts from the day they enter school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lack of specialists. Nearly every young person in an urban school would have an opportunity at some stage to have a specialist made available, but that is not the case for our rural or regional young people. Neither are as many high school curriculum options available to them. The high schools in country areas are smaller and our regional young people do not have the diversity of subjects available to them. They are consequently not properly skilled and, therefore, have limited employment opportunities. It is a very difficult situation which young people in rural Australia face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of our rural and regional young people have to leave home if they are to get a higher education. Unlike their urban counterparts who can stay at home and maintain their peer social network, rural young people who move away have to support themselves emotionally and socially. While they are on very tight economic constraints, they also have to stand on their own two feet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, we as members of this parliament are not doing enough to improve access to higher education for rural and regional people. We should probably assist people starting at year 11 or year 12, and then for even higher education and no doubt for TAFE as well. I do believe the government has been very tardy as it has not provided the same access to higher education to rural and regional young people that urban young people have available to them. The government owes it to all Australians, particularly to rural people who make up the backbone of this continent, to revise the whole Austudy system to make it equitable and just. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I rise to speak to the Student Assistance (Budget Matters) Amendment Bill 1994. I must say the member for Braddon (Mr Miles) raised some very valid points about brothers and sisters and their children in rural areas. I am sure it will be found that I will acknowledge those needs in my speech here today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken often about educational issues in this place. I keep raising school retention, early intervention strategies and ever widening access to education for our young people because I sincerely believe the people sitting on the benches opposite&mdash;there are a few exceptions&mdash;do not have education very high on their political agenda. I believe we cannot speak too often in this place about the importance of educating our young people&mdash;increasing their self-confidence, encouraging them to remain in places of learning and ensuring that they move into the real world with skills and knowledge which will enrich both themselves and this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said before that in just over 10 years this government has achieved more in education than all of the postwar conservative governments put together. The conservatives have consistently failed to recognise this country's greatest asset: its people and the effect of intellectual growth and skill development on increased productivity, higher standards of living and overall quality of life. In just one decade, since 1983, this government has provided for an increase in higher education places well in excess of 60 per cent. Between 1989 and 1994, an additional 85,000 places in higher education have been created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have often witnessed members on the benches opposite opposing the changes which have taken place over this period, but that is not surprising. The conservative members opposite often display a serious inability to grasp fully the importance of change in this ever changing world we live in. They are being left behind in the education policy area because they insist on clinging to their fundamental philosophy of opposing change, just for the sake of it. Many are still living in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to spend some time reminding those opposite about the Austudy scheme, because it provides a stark contrast between this government and the former conservative government. In 1983, when the Labor government inherited double digit inflation, double digit unemployment, an economy going backwards and an education system in a mess, just $269 million was spent on Austudy payments or their equivalent. In the last financial year, this government&mdash;and it has been acknowledged by the member for Braddon&mdash;has increased funds to the Austudy-Abstudy and assistance for isolated children schemes to about $1.6 billion. Austudy and higher education funding together now total in excess of $6 billion. That represents a major commitment by this government, particularly when taken as a percentage of total budget outlays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be useful to outline briefly again to honourable members some of the eligibility criteria which Austudy recipients must meet to qualify for income support. For families with dependent students, and this was pointed out by the member for Braddon, there is an assets limit of $369,350. For single independent students, it is $110,000. For married students, it is a combined $156,800. Austudy takes into account the net market value of assets. The scheme also applies a 50 per cent discount on certain business and farm assets. I will talk more about farm assets later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assets test is waived where the student's parent or spouse receives certain pensions from the Department of Veterans' Affairs or the Department of Social Security, such as the age pension, sole parent pension, carer pension, and special benefit. Income test thresholds also apply. I say again that the Austudy-Abstudy scheme is a targeted scheme for low income families. It is about access to education for the kids of low income families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has raised concerns in the past about assessable fringe benefits. This involves the total value of fringe benefits in excess of $1,000 received in the relevant fringe benefit year through the employment of each parent or spouse in respect of organising lower salaries through the payment of school fees, private health insurance, housing, low interest loans and provision of a motor vehicle. This does not normally raise a great deal of concern from members opposite, but these fringe benefits, as we would all admit, are in effect income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Family income is also adjusted for dependent children in the following amounts: $3,700 for each dependent child aged 16 to 22 in full-time education, $1,200 for the first other dependent child under 16, and $2,500 for each subsequent dependent child under 16. We must keep in mind that Austudy-Abstudy is an extremely complex scheme. It is designed to accommodate the enormously different needs and circumstances of over half a million Australians and their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's commitment to the Austudy-Abstudy scheme reflects its belief that access to higher education should be targeted to those students from low income families. I have said before in this place that it is a targeted scheme and is about access to education. It is entirely appropriate that it remains a targeted scheme. It should be based on educational merit, not on the ability of parents to pay their children's way through university. That is the way of the past. That is not what people on this side of the House are on about. This government takes education very seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision of more places for our young people to learn needs to be supported by income support to enable them to take advantage of the places available. The amendments proposed in the Student Assistance (Budget Matters) Amendment Bill will strengthen the Austudy-Abstudy scheme by simplifying access to the supplementary loan scheme for students. They are measures requiring legislative changes to the Student Assistance Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members may not be aware of this loan scheme to assist students with their expenses in gaining qualifications to make Australia a better place, a more internationally competitive nation, a more civilised and prosperous place. The loan scheme, which was introduced in the 1992-93 budget, is an extension to the tertiary end of the Austudy and Abstudy schemes. The Austudy-Abstudy supplement is optional. That point needs to be made clear. Students do not need to take it up, but it is there in case living and studying expenses need to be met. As honourable members would know, students do not stand much of a chance in the commercial loans market. The supplement meets that need, but it is an option to be decided by the student. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The supplement works this way. Students are granted Austudy or Abstudy. They can then choose to trade in part of the year's grant on a loan which is twice the amount they trade in. The next year they can trade in up to $3,500 of their grant to obtain a maximum loan of $7,000. This loan is paid fortnightly along with the Austudy-Abstudy payment. Being a loan, of course, they pay it back. They pay back the whole of the $7,000, which includes the amount of the grant they have traded in. They do not have to pay it back until five years after taking it and until their income reaches average weekly earnings. Then it is repaid in instalments at only a few percentage points of the person's salary a year. If they pay it back within five years a discount is granted. The student does not pay interest on the loan. That is paid by the government on the student's behalf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tertiary students whose parental income precludes eligibility to Austudy or Abstudy can be eligible for a loan of up to $2,000 a year provided their parents' income is less than $50,000. This is called a category 2 supplement loan. That is not a bad fall-back if education expenses get too steep, and we all appreciate that they can. Again, it is an optional scheme and students need to think about whether they want to take it up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A survey of potential supplement recipients was undertaken by DEET in 1993. It indicated that, while most students were aware of the scheme, most thought the eligibility entitlement rules were too complex. I think the honourable member for Braddon mentioned that. These two budget changes, to take effect from 1 January 1995, will make the supplement loan scheme more equitable by extending eligibility for a category two supplement loan to students who are ineligible for Austudy on the basis of their spouse's income and make it possible for a student to trade in Austudy at any time of the year to access their maximum loan entitlement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be the first to admit that these changes are not the sort of stuff to stir the world, but they are improvements. This government is continually looking to better and fairer administration because there are over 500,000 students out there getting assistance through Austudy. I do not think all in the opposition see that because they knocked back a previous bill which put Abstudy and the assistance for isolated children, or AIC as it is known, into a legislative framework instead of having them administered by guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government can wear that sort of lack of cooperation, but it is a little off the wall for the government to propose sensible legislation improving the administration of student financial assistance only to have the opposition rev it up into something entirely separate by proposing the abolition of the assets test. Sure, it sounds good on a superficial and non-substantive basis, but it had nothing, not a thing, to do with the legislation at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only 105 rural applications were knocked back this year because of the assets test. That was one per cent of all Austudy knock-backs lodged from rural areas. By far, the greatest reason for application rejections in rural Australia was too much income. Seventy-four per cent&mdash;three-quarters&mdash;were rejected because they had too much income. I think it is not so much the assets test as the fact that many farming families are overvaluing their assets and are simply not lodging applications. That is an issue the government is keen to pursue and we will be publicising the student financial assistance schemes in the bush to make sure that families are getting their entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also going to take a closer look at just how the assets test is affecting farmers. Mr Deputy Speaker Reid, you, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) and the honourable member for Braddon should remember that there is a 50 per cent discount applying to farm and business assets. A farming family can have assets to the tune of $738,700 net&mdash;that is, after any debt is deducted&mdash;and still qualify under the assets test. It is generous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An unleveraged asset of over $700,000 can be leveraged to help give kids an education. Again, the government is taking seriously the impact of reduced rural circumstances because we do believe in ensuring education opportunities for all Australians. I hope we can expect some cooperation on these budget measures. I hope that the opposition does not go off on a tangent and that these measures are seen for what they are&mdash;sensible, administrative improvements to student financial assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Student financial assistance is good news. Students from ordinary families get some help to finish school and go on to post-secondary education. As I said, it is not peanuts. Austudy is paid to students whose families have an income under about $33,000 a year. For country students who have to live away from home, the parental income threshold is over $42,000 a year. That is the adjusted income after deductions for other kids in the family. Because of the taper in the income test, it is a big help to less well-off families with children at school, university, TAFE, doing open learning or attending a private training course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the shadow minister for schools, vocational education and training, the honourable member for Braddon, and as well the honourable member for Maranoa will bear this in mind when the government produces sensible policies to assist students. I hope the former senior shadow minister for education, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), who has put in a grand total of four questions affecting his patch in about the last four years&mdash;he asked another two the other day&mdash;will also pay attention to the needs of students when the government puts forward useful changes to the administration of student financial assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Incidentally, honourable members should be aware that last week cabinet approved a very small but significant change to the assistance for the isolated children scheme. From October we are extending the boarding allowance up to year 12&mdash;assets test free. That means rural, isolated families who do not meet the reasonably generous assets test provisions of Austudy can receive assistance to keep their kids at high school. This is a pretty sensible improvement, because the full boarding allowance was available only up to age 16, when students would have to transfer to Austudy or receive a $2,500 boarding allowance if their assets were too high. Fortunately, this does not need the tick of the opposition. Why? Because it knocked back the previous legislation which sought to put the AIC scheme into legislation. Those opposite get a little confused sometimes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The supplement loan scheme is a relatively new student assistance product. We have it pretty right, but it needs a couple of minor but sensible improvements. Students whose spouse's income is too high for the student to get any Austudy or Abstudy will, from 1 January next year, be able to take a supplement loan, providing the spouse's income is less than $35,000. Austudy and Abstudy are there to benefit not just youngsters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other measure, as I have said, will make it easier for students to trade in their Austudy or Abstudy at any time during the year up to a maximum of $3,500 for a loan of twice the amount. This simplifies things because there are cut-offs in the scheme which mean that the amount of Austudy-Abstudy that a student can trade in is determined by when they apply for a loan. Both these measures deserve support by honourable members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I pointed out earlier, this government has the runs on the board as far as assisting our young people to remain in the educational system for as long as necessary is concerned. The proportion of young people who now complete secondary school has risen from 36 per cent in 1982 to well over 80 per cent. The number of students enrolled in higher education has increased from 335,000 students in 1983 to 533,000 last year. TAFE colleges are approaching 1.8 million full-time, part-time and external students. We should have been doing these things in the 1960s. I remind opposition members that, in 1983, 152,000 students were in the schemes which preceded Austudy. In 1993, 500,000 students have benefited from the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can remind ourselves very easily of the stark contrast between the conservative approach and the approach of this government to Austudy and Abstudy. The conservatives are still committed to slashing $27 million from payments to Australian children and families by raising the minimum Austudy cut-off by 50 per cent. They have not abandoned that commitment. Let us reflect for a moment on what the opposition stated in the Fightback document regarding Austudy:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In line with the coalition's pledge to target student assistance to the most needy, better targeting could be achieved by setting a minimum threshold on Austudy. Austudy would not be paid to anyone currently eligible for less than $30. Assuming that people receiving less than $30 per week in Austudy benefits receive on average $15 a week (that is, $780 a year) and taking the January-March 1991 numbers of recipients to be equal to annual numbers, placing a $30 minimum threshold on Austudy would save $21 million. Tightening the criteria for the operation of `exceptional circumstances' provision would save $6 million. Of the total saving of $27 million, it is anticipated that $13 million will be achieved in the first year and the additional $14 million in the second year.</PARA>
<PARA>That is your policy. There it is, right there. This quote from the Fightback documents says it all regarding the opposition's education policies. I put it to honourable members that we on this side of the House approach the issue of providing the best possible education for Australians and the financial support necessary to pursue an education from a very different perspective to the conservatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As this student assistance amendment bill shows, the Labor government is about increasing access to education, not decreasing it. The opposition's view on student assistance is there for all to see. It resorts to word fencing, chicanery, ignoratio elenchi and pettifogging. In other words, opposition members are muddled, they are confused, they are woolly-headed and they are prone to unwarranted conclusions. The sacking of the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) from the front bench last Friday was a perfect example of that total confusion and the tactics in question time today by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) were another example. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rules and regulations which drive Austudy have not been designed to find those in need of assistance but rather to control government outlays with a minimum of fuss and bother. Unfortunately, this approach is of no comfort to young Australians seeking to further their skills and education. This narrow-minded approach will in the long term be a burden to all Australians who are relying on the skills and knowledge base of today's students who build the industries and services of the future. I look forward to the day when a bill is presented to this House which provides for an equitable and flexible approach to student assistance, one in which rules are designed to measure a student's or a student's parents' ability to realistically access and pay for further education. I have no doubt that the only government to introduce such an approach will be a Liberal-National Party government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it particularly disappointing during this time of unprecedented rural hardship that the government has not sought to relax the Austudy eligibility criteria, which continue to thwart rural students and their children. The government's decision to abolish the assets test for high school students is a welcome relief. I acknowledge that the minister presented that submission to cabinet today, but I cannot see why higher education students from rural areas were not afforded a similar level of assistance. They and their parents continue to face an onerous and inappropriate assets test which in no way reflects their ability to access education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An analysis of the farm performance statistics provided by ABARE supports the claim from farmers across the country and members of parliament from this side of the House that the current assets test limit is entirely inappropriate for rural families and in no way indicative of a family's ability to meet education costs. I hope the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) is listening because, according to ABARE&mdash;not this side of the House&mdash;farm business profit for broadacre farms in 1992-93 was a negative $17,450. Yet the average farm business equity was $780,410. Such equity levels would clearly place average farmers in breach of the assets test and consequently ineligible for Austudy even though their business is not generating one dollar of positive income. These are ABARE figures that would be accessible by the government and the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the worsening drought since 1992, the situation has deteriorated further and in 1994 is likely to show a further deterioration in those income levels. It is important to remember that the assets which caused farmers so much grief are not luxury homes, luxury boats, artwork or jewellery. In fact, I know many families who have sold their family jewellery. An engagement ring has been sold just to put food on the table. If you bother to get out and talk to the Lifeline people, the Salvation Army, St Vincent de Paul and the church groups, you will find that those stories are authenticated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assets that cause farmers grief are their productivity assets such as land, stock, tractors, combines, dozers and harvesters. It is all well and good to say, `If you have got a valuable asset you should be able to sell it.' That attitude misses the point entirely. Selling farm assets would threaten the farm's ability to continue production in the short term and it would threaten its viability as a business enterprise in the long term. If a farmer sells his tractor to send his son or daughter to university, how will he be able to plough the paddocks or pull the scrub to feed his animals in the future?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As difficult and seemingly counterproductive as asset sales may seem, there are still many families who are prepared to take that risk just to secure their children's education. I know of a farming family in Central Queensland who sold their seed stocks to send their daughter to university. The difficulty in sustaining the farm without the crops that would have eventuated from that seed is obvious and that will be yet another challenge for this family in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are numerous other stories of families in my electorate who have sold breeding stock and equipment simply to meet the costs of education. In the long term, they will face more pressing problems as their farms teeter on the brink of unviability. That will not be a concern of this government, but I hope that it will change its attitude on asset testing and access to assistance for rural students. It seems to be the government's approach that it will offer farmers a grant to leave farming. This will mean that the skills and experience of yet another family farming enterprise will be lost forever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Austudy scheme makes no provision for the unique asset structure of rural enterprises. Such enterprises carry a heavy asset load which is directly linked to the productivity of the enterprise and certainly not to the lifestyle of the owners. It is also important to bear in mind that the assets are not always easily liquidated. Who is going to buy a drought stricken property incapable of producing income? Furthermore, there is not always a clear linkage between assets and income. High assets do not necessarily produce high income and, in the case of severe drought, may produce no income at all, as the ABARE figures clearly demonstrate. When such lack of income is combined with high and unrealistic assets, farm families are left truly destitute. They have no income themselves and with their high assets levels they are  precluded from receiving most forms of government assistance, including Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we believe what the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) had to say, the only reason&mdash;the government is hiding behind this reason and not making substantial changes to the Austudy  eligibility criteria&mdash;that farming families cannot access Austudy is that they do not actually apply for it. What nonsense! If that is the case, it is because  they know  only  too well just how</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farming families also know about the trauma that can eventuate if the Austudy administration should rule that they have undervalued their assets. Families in that situation simply receive a very curt letter informing them of the overpayment and requesting repayment of the benefits, often worth thousands of dollars, within 14 days. If payment is not received within three months, they face interest charges as well. I inform Senator Collins&mdash;and I hope he gets the message&mdash;that that is why farming families cannot afford to take the risk. They are forced to deal with a bureaucratic and inefficient administration that has no regard for the repercussions of its actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer the House to a particular family in North Queensland who was forced to repay over $6,000 in Austudy benefits when their assets were revalued. In this case, the valuer did not challenge the value of the family assets until some three years after the initial self-evaluation and application for benefits. On the basis of a valuation conducted in 1992, this family was deemed ineligible for Austudy not only for 1992 but also for 1990 and 1991 and forced to repay the benefits received during those years. Had the valuation been checked in those early years, the valuer would have found a barren, unproductive and worthless property which would have posted absolutely no threat to the assets limit. </PARA>

They said that their net assets were $1,000 above the limit for receiving assistance under the Austudy assets and income test scheme. That family has to repay $8,000 in the middle of one of the worst droughts on record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know of other families who have been treated with similar disrespect.

Some of the students are in the middle of their exams. </PARA>

They know that their friends are telling the stories and they know that I am getting the message. I hope the minister can get the message. There are thousands of families who do not bother with the Austudy system because they know of its reputation for stringent assessment and harsh treatment of those who face revaluations. The way the revaluation is conducted is quite unfair. </PARA>

Their efforts have been magnificent but ultimately unrewarded by this immovable government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The approach I would suggest the government pursue is to start from the beginning and consider how it can truly identify the ability of a family or an individual to realistically meet the costs of secondary or higher education.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill changes some of the rules for Austudy and Abstudy eligibility and, in particular, student loans. Tertiary students may trade part or all of their entitlement to Austudy or Abstudy benefits for an interest free loan of twice the amount of benefit traded. Supplement loans are also available to students who do not qualify for Austudy or Abstudy because the parental income test provided that the parental income test is less than a specified amount, which is currently $50,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures are hardly a boost to the system. They are euphemistically described as a simplification of the rules. I am amused at the language that governments are able to use to disguise what is a cut to the Austudy student loans program. These measures will produce a net saving to the government of $5.5 million a year. So, instead of providing more benefits to students, this bill provides fewer benefits. Some $5.5 million less will be available to students for educational assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the current arrangements, many people are denied tertiary education for financial reasons. That is a totally unsatisfactory state of affairs. I have a philosophical view that tertiary education should be available to all those who wish to have it. Financial reasons should not be a factor in denying people the opportunity to achieve a higher education. Part of achieving that objective clearly has to be an effective student loan scheme. It is obviously beyond the budgetary possibilities of any government to provide indefinitely free tertiary education to all those who would like to have it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In cases where Austudy is not available for whatever reason, there needs to be an effective student loan scheme, as applies in so many other countries of the world. Many people in country areas, such as farmers and small business people, are unable to obtain Austudy for their children due to the assets test. In many of those instances, their sons and daughters are denied a tertiary education. I believe that is a totally unsatisfactory state of affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many instances, rather than the parents being denied Austudy, the children just take other options. Rather than put additional stress on the family when they know that young sons and daughters are required to help with the business or the farm, they just voluntarily forgo a tertiary education. That is also an unacceptable situation. An expanded loan scheme would enable those children to obtain the tertiary education they need without placing an undue burden on their families. They would then pay back that loan during their working careers from the additional income that they would hopefully earn by virtue of their superior qualifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many instances, it is the country people who are denied access to university education. Naturally, it is more difficult for them to travel the distance. The government's own higher education series pointed this out very graphically in a report on urban and rural participation which was released in September 1990. I am sorry that these figures are so old, but I do not know that any more recent figures are available. This series produced by the government demonstrated that only three per cent of Australia's tertiary students come from what are called remote areas. The vast majority of Australia's students come from urban parts of the continent. Participation in higher education of people from remote areas per head of population is only half that in urban areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any government that is seriously interested in social equity could not regard those statistics as satisfactory. It is something that needs to be addressed. Even the three per cent who come from remote areas have more to do with the definition of `remote' than anything else. Nearly half of all the students in remote areas are enrolled in Queensland institutions and 25 per cent of the total are enrolled in James Cook University in Townsville alone. That is because the areas around Townsville are classified as `remote'. So that three per cent figure is not genuinely made up of people from farm areas or what most people would regard as remote areas. The real figures are worse. Many people from rural and regional Australia have no opportunity at all to participate in tertiary education because the current assistance measures are unfairly directed against them. I believe that needs to be addressed. A student loan scheme could be worth while. It could provide people with a real opportunity for tertiary education which would not otherwise be available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also believe that the tertiary loans scheme ought to be available on a much wider basis for other worthwhile education purposes. I refer to a letter I received from Chadwick and Smart Pty Ltd in my electorate. Chadwick and Smart are aircraft maintenance engineers in Kingaroy. They drew attention to their great difficulty in attracting and training new licensed aircraft engineers. They mention in their letter that their efforts over the last few years to bring apprentices up to this qualification have been made extremely difficult by the excessive cost levied by the CAA to issue and mark many of the exams which LAMEs must complete. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It charges $120 for each exam, plus a $20 supervisory fee, and that is on top of the training fees charged by the South Brisbane College of TAFE and other providers. The drop-out rate for apprentices in the industry is, therefore, unduly high. When faced by these expenses, bearing in mind that these people are earning only relatively low wages, many of them drop out rather than pay the fees. That is making a bad situation even worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has an urgent need to train more aircraft engineers. We should be encouraging young apprentices to upgrade their qualifications in this field. There are many opportunities in Australia to service aircraft from other parts of the world, and indeed this could be a new sunrise industry for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that in this particular instance the charges are actually levied by the CAA, but why could these sorts of charges&mdash;which are a legitimate part of education expenses&mdash;also not be included in a tertiary loans scheme so that once the qualifications are achieved the aircraft engineer can pay them back in subsequent years from his or her additional earnings? When I raised this matter with the minister for aviation, he justified the charges on the basis of CAA's cost recovery regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important that we address these in an education context. People who have to face examination charges and other legitimate education expenses should be able to pay them back through the education loans scheme. I would encourage the minister to give thought to extending this kind of program to cover those sorts of education expenses. It is an investment in one's future and it is a tragedy that people who are close to qualification in these sorts of areas drop out because they are unable to meet the examination expenses. We are losing the opportunity to train tradesmen who could add significantly to Australia's skills as a nation and our capacity to earn income in areas such as this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, of course, a need to extend university facilities into a number of new country areas so that the penalty of having to travel to a faraway centre is reduced.

We have no university facilities in the fast growing Fraser coast region&mdash;one of the fastest growing areas of Australia. The University of Southern Queensland has an annexe in the Hervey Bay region, which annexe it is threatening now to close. It is blaming cutbacks in federal government funding&mdash;I think somewhat unfairly&mdash;for its actions. I do not think USQ has ever had a proper commitment to the Hervey Bay region. There is a study at the present time into what can be done to provide facilities in the Fraser coast region. I would encourage the Commonwealth government to cooperate with this study and be prepared to provide the necessary funding so that a suitable facility can be provided to serve the students in my own electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move to another issue. I have raised this case with the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free), who is at the table. I am grateful that he is present so I can raise it again. I refer to a case highlighted by my own constituents, but I know there are similar cases where this injustice has been perpetrated. Jamie, the son of Mr and Mrs Goodsall of Maryborough, was denied Austudy in 1991. They sought a review by the Student Assistance Review Tribunal. Mr and Mrs Goodsall attended a hearing of the tribunal in Brisbane on 21 June 1991. They had to travel for three hours over the congested highways and at considerable inconvenience to attend this hearing in Brisbane. When they arrived the hearing was adjourned because the senior departmental officers present were unable to provide essential information required by the tribunal. The departmental officers did not have the information that was required with them. As the failure to adequately prepare for the review was entirely the fault of the department, the tribunal decided, and I quote directly from its ruling:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to direct the Department to make payment to Mr Noel and Mrs Judy Goodsall a single amount calculated in accordance with regulation 101, being a reasonable amount towards their travel expenses incurred in travelling from Maryborough to Brisbane, return, to attend the hearing.</PARA>
<PARA>I thought that was a pretty reasonable ruling for the tribunal to make, and one which we would regard as natural justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department sought details of the costs from my constituents but did not actually make the payment. A second hearing of the Student Assistance Review Tribunal was held on 16 August 1991 and was again attended by Mr and Mrs Goodsall. In its decision the tribunal again referred to the matter of travel expenses for Mr and Mrs Goodsall for the adjourned proceedings on 21 June. The tribunal in its ruling said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in making the decision to adjourn the hearing, the Tribunal directed the department to reimburse the applicant's parents for their travelling costs. On reflection, it is now the Tribunal's opinion that it did not have jurisdiction to couch the matter in those terms. It has no jurisdiction to direct that such payment be made. Nevertheless, nothing has occurred to make the Tribunal alter its opinion that such payment should be made. Therefore, it recommends the Department give earnest consideration to such payment of costs in a manner and amount referred to in the earlier reasons, the decision in respect of which, is amended accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA>I am disturbed to report to the parliament that, despite the ruling and despite the subsequent recommendation by the tribunal, the department has refused to make any payment of travel expenses to Mr and Mrs Goodsall. The tribunal in its decision of 16 August said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the parents . . . had been brought to Brisbane in the reasonable expectation that the matter could and would be resolved. At the hearing, however, there was no prospect of reaching finality because the authorised and senior authorised person had not addressed themselves to the central issue of whether or not the applicant was undertaking a degree course . . . The applicant's parents made an unnecessary trip to Brisbane.</PARA>
<PARA>I appreciate that there may be some question as to whether the tribunal had the power to make the order that it did. However, my constituents rightly emphasised that they were obliged to accept what was eventually an unfavourable decision by the umpire on the eligibility of their son for Austudy; therefore, they find it disturbing and a denial of natural justice that the department will not accept the umpire's decision in relation to travel expenses. They had to accept the denial of their son's eligibility, but the department did not accept the other side of the tribunal's ruling and eventual recommendation that they should meet travel expenses for the aborted hearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raised this matter with the minister and he pointed out, quite correctly, that there was no power within the act for the tribunal to order the payment of these expenses.

I am disappointed he did not exercise that option in this particular case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He did point out that the applicants could have had the inquiry conducted over the phone and saved themselves some expense. In other words, country clients can have only second-class justice; others are able to come in and put their case across the table. If country people want to save themselves the expense, they have to revert to a telephone hearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is really an unsatisfactory response, and I am disappointed that there is no amendment in this bill to correct the situation. I commend to the minister the suggestion that it is not unreasonable for the tribunal to be able to order costs against the department where the department has been negligent in its duty to come to the hearing with the necessary information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My constituents were brought to Brisbane for a hearing that never had any chance of resolving the issue because of the failure of the department to bring the necessary information to the hearing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final issue I would like to touch on in relation to this matter is the argument that is going on at present about university placements in the states. Queensland is grievously disadvantaged in the number of university places available. Even though Queensland has 17.7 per cent of the nation's population, we have only 16.6 per cent of allocated university places. That disadvantages Queensland to the order of 6,000 places each year.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The entire cost of sending kids away to those boarding schools which were charging $6,000 or $7,000 in places such as Charters Towers was met by the state and federal governments. I was absolutely appalled to do the figures this year and find out that the school costs had gone up, as everything else has gone up, to around $9,000 to $10,000 for a school year and that the assistance from the state and federal governments was falling considerably short of $7,000. That is without a means test or with a means test&mdash;either way. There is no way that the average employee in a town could afford to do this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bigger towns that are affected include Julia Creek, Georgetown, Normanton, Karumba, Burketown, Winton, Muttaburra, Aramac, Richmond, Camooweal, Forsayth, Degarra, Hughenden, Mount Surprise and Einasleigh. I will not mention the dozens of smaller ones. In all those towns, with some 12,000 or 15,000 Australians living in them&mdash;I am not including any of the people who are living on station properties or in isolated railway or mining camps; I am just reeling off the ones out west that leap to my mind&mdash;none of the children will be able to go away to school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to studies on the cost of living in these towns which were conducted by the Teachers Union and the James Cook University. Both gave identical figures that there is a 26 per cent higher cost of living in the mid-west region of North Queensland than in Brisbane. I think we can safely conclude that that figure of 26 per cent can be relied upon. There is no way in the world that people in those towns on even a reasonable income can afford $3,000, $4,000 or $5,000 a year to send their kids away to school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of education, we are back in the Stone Age. I am not talking about tertiary education. This bill is about tertiary education, but these kids cannot get to the tertiary level. They will be deprived of a secondary education, much less a tertiary education. Unless their parents are rich&mdash;and heaven only knows that there is hardly anyone in that category in western Queensland these days&mdash;or unless they are of Aboriginal descent, it is impossible for them to get a secondary education. Class lines are being violently drawn once again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not hesitate to speak of my own self-consciousness about being one of the lucky ones in the town of Cloncurry to have been able to get a secondary education and of how embarrassed I felt when I went home and saw so many of my mates who were not able to have the advantages that I had. We are back to the bad old days. It has taken only three years under the socialists to project us back into the Stone Age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be interesting to find out how many countries deprive a significant proportion of their population of equality of opportunity in education. I dare say that there would not be too many. In our day and age, there would not be too many in South America. There may be some in Central America and there may be some in Africa. I would very much doubt that many people in Asia would be deprived of a secondary education. There most certainly would not be many in central Europe or in Europe as a whole. We have now achieved in our states and nation the removal from a very significant proportion of our population&mdash;maybe as much as five or six per cent of the entire population&mdash;any equality of opportunity as far as education is concerned. These people are deprived completely of that field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Without a secondary education in the state of Queensland, one cannot join the Public Service, get an apprenticeship or, become a real estate or an insurance agent. One cannot build a home, because a TAFE certificate is needed these days, and to get that a secondary education is necessary. One cannot get a plant operator's ticket in the state of Queensland without a secondary education. So it is very hard to find what these people will be qualified to do in future. Is there a more brutal and oppressive deprivation than the one that is being applied at the moment by the total failure of the state and federal governments to act in this area?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In order to bring home the point, let me give some examples of what is occurring. For example, it is depressing in the extreme to walk into homesteads&mdash;I have been talking about townspeople; I have not been talking about people who live on stations, so let me talk about them for one moment&mdash;where there are no pictures on the walls. Even the homes of better-off graziers have no pictures on the walls or furniture; its occupants sit on stools. There is nothing in the houses; there are only four walls. For those who doubt for a moment that this is true, I plead with them to come with me. Let them select the station properties that they want to visit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some have inherited wealth. They have large investments on the coast and other places, but they are small in number these days. I have seen 50- and 60-year-old women draughting cattle, riding horses and doing the most dangerous of work while their cousins in the city are taking it easy by sitting in front of the television. But that does not worry these people because they do not have any television.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I have seen young men having to leave their wives and sell Amway in the local town to try to keep body and soul together, to enable their kids to go away to school and to hold on to their jobs, because that is what the station amounts to. People are working in town in clerical jobs. A wife may work in town and live away from her husband; he does not see her. He takes mustering jobs up in the Gulf country, so he is never home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I took these notes at a meeting, where I looked around at the people present. There were people present who had been away plant operating. The marriage of one young married man has fallen to pieces because he was away for nearly six months fettling on a railway. His mate, who was also on a station, was fettling with him on the railway. They were working as labourers on the railway. He did not see his wife and his three young kids. Heaven only knows, they lived in a galvanised iron shed in the Gulf country on their station. But he now does not have a family because his family has broken up. His wife was living by herself in the middle of nowhere for six months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Another case came to my attention at this meeting. One woman took a job as a domestic in one school so that her kid would not be thrown out of boarding school because she had not been able to pay the fees. I do not know whether the school was All Souls or Blackheath in Charters Towers, but the people at the school provided her with a job because they did not have the heart to kick yet another kid out of the school. They may not have needed her services there, but she worked at a very hard job to keep her kid at school. This was just at one meeting. These are the sacrifices that people are making to try to provide their kids with an education, which, until four years ago, was the right of every Australian child. As far as I am concerned, having watched the extreme oppression in days past, that was the proudest of accomplishments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> For those who think the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), who spoke earlier today, and I are exaggerating, let me say to them with as much sincerity as I can muster on the issue that they are sewing seeds of hatred. There will be a reaping of the whirlwind down the track. Let there be no doubt that, when this sort of oppression occurs to a class of people, somewhere down the track there will be an evening of scores. One can look again and again at the examples of history. In the ugly realities of Cambodia, the colonial government and its successors in the city bled the countryside white for nearly 60 or 70 years. The kids of Ireland were deprived of an education for nearly 300 or 400 years. That is what is happening to every kid that is living inland at present, with the exception of a few lucky ones who live in Mount Isa or Longreach, where facilities are available to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Today, for the first time in the last 15 or 20 years, we have suddenly been projected back into the Stone Age. No longer is the right to a secondary education, never mind a tertiary education, available to all Australians. I have heard that some people are preoccupied about means tests and all those things. Do not talk about a means test and money; just say that we will provide a sum of money to send a child not to some elite GPS school in the big southern capitals&mdash;that is not what we are asking for&mdash;but to the nearest boarding school. Hardworking, great Australians have made terrific sacrifices in very spartan conditions to provide us with education that is as cheap as is humanly possible for the boys and girls who go away to these boarding schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All we are asking for is a lousy little $10,000, which is only an extension of $3,000 or $4,000, for about 30,000 or 40,000 Australians who are placed in this invidious situation. They will wear the scars and burden of having no education behind them for the rest of their days. They will not be able to become public servants, tradesmen, real estate agents or insurance agents. They will not even be able to build their own houses in the state of Queensland. They will not even be able to get a plant operator's ticket. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All we are asking for is fairness, but that is what we are not getting at the present moment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In closing the debate, I remind the House that the Student Assistance (Budget Matters) Amendment Bill 1994 is intended to give effect to two measures announced in the budget concerning Austudy. The measures will simplify the rules relating to the repayment of benefits and will make supplement loans available to students who are not eligible for benefits because of the application of the spouse income test. I mention the provisions of the bill because this debate has ranged so far and wide that a number of the speakers did not even manage to mention the features of the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I thank all those who have taken part, particularly the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), who made a reasoned contribution. The honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles), the opposition spokesman, expressed concern about a lack of access to tertiary education for regional and rural Australia. I remind him that when his party was in office Australia had 16 universities which were almost exclusively located in the capital cities. We now have in excess of 30 universities across the country, many of which offer access to regional and rural Australia. In our last term, we launched Open Learning Australia to extend those services even further. The honourable member for Braddon also expressed some concern about what it might cost a family to send students away to higher education institutions, citing an amount of between $16,000 and $18,000 for two students. He suggested that it was time for a hard look at the amount of money we make available under Austudy&mdash;in other words, it was time for a hard look at the quantum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One might be excused for thinking that opposition members themselves had taken the opportunity to have a hard look at this but, as the honourable member for Port Adelaide pointed out, if you turn to page 250 of the last detailed policy we had from the opposition&mdash;the Fightback document&mdash;you will find, under the heading `Education', this fine statement of principle:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition believes education expenditure is a vital investment in our future. It is an integral part of our job strategy for the 90's.</PARA>
<PARA>But the top of that section shows that the estimated net spending was minus-$240 million. Fightback illustrated the opposition's commitment to education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having listened to the remarks of the honourable member for Braddon and his opposition colleagues, you might be excused for thinking that the opposition had in its policy last year some intention to extend Austudy benefits and to provide greater levels of payment for students. In fact, page 252 of Fightback shows that the opposition, on its own costings, proposed to cut $27 million from the Austudy budget. In fact, the finance costings of Fightback suggest that this was an underestimate and that the Fightback proposal would have cut in excess of $30 million from the Austudy budget, removing benefits from some 30,000 students. So the opposition's suggestion that we should have a hard look at Austudy benefits obviously dates some time after Fightback. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suggestion by the honourable member for Braddon that this bill somehow encourages students to take loans is not correct. The loan system is there for students to access if they wish. It is, in this case, a debt triggered by the achievement of average earnings, with a zero real interest rate applying. The honourable member then addressed what has emerged during this debate as a major concern to members of the opposition, and that is the application of the assets test to rural families for Austudy purposes. I will address that in more detail later in my remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Braddon dealt with a number of cases and I point out that, if Carina, Jenny and the others are really excluded from receiving student assistance because of family income or family assets, one should not assume that tertiary education is therefore going to be forever unavailable to them. There are options that young people in these circumstances can look at. For example, they can commence part-time studies or they can commence external studies. Honourable members should remember that, as a result of the policies of this government, the age of independence for Austudy purposes has been falling progressively and will go down to 22 next year. In other words, students who are aged 22 next year will be eligible for assessment for Austudy at the independent rate, where parental assets and parental incomes do not count. So any suggestion that tertiary education is removed forever as an option for such young people is certainly not correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) exhibited not so much a knowledge of drought policy as a drought of policy on the opposition side. Listening to the honourable member for Maranoa, one could be pardoned for believing that no farming families at all in this country were receiving Austudy benefits. He referred to the Austudy rules thwarting rural families. He may really believe that no farm families are in receipt of Austudy. In fact, there are in the order of 14,000 farm families receiving these benefits. As the honourable member for Port Adelaide pointed out, there is a one per cent rejection rate for farm families on the grounds of assets&mdash;the same level as applies generally. As has also been pointed out, farm properties are subject to a 50 per cent discount. Assets test free boarding allowances have been extended for families in isolated circumstances as well. These special measures that have been extended for farm families only hardly amount to a system which acts against their interests and thwarts them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Maranoa referred to average farm equity, as researched by ABARE, being in the order of $780,000. I do not dispute that figure for a moment. Honourable members should remember, however, that for Austudy asset testing one can subtract from that figure the value of the house and surrounding two hectares which, as the honourable member for Maranoa said, is in the order of $30,000 anyway, which brings you very close to the assets limit for farm families of $738,000. But, in any case, that is average farm equity and nobody has ever claimed that student assistance should be accessed by all families. On the figures of the honourable member for Maranoa, we are very close to catering for 50 per cent of farm families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) made a most intelligent contribution to the debate. He certainly revealed that there is some diversity of view in the opposition in relation to tertiary loans. He wants to see loans extended. I am not sure that the honourable member for Braddon does, but that is something he might like to discuss with his colleague. I am grateful to the honourable member for Wide Bay for his acknowledgment that it is impossible for any government to provide free tertiary education and income support&mdash;student assistance&mdash;to everybody. That is precisely why benefits, while generous, must be targeted on the basis of need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened carefully to what the honourable member had to say about two of his constituents, Mr and Mrs Goodsall of Maryborough. As he quite correctly pointed out, it is the job of the tribunals to sort out entitlements to student assistance and not to add to their responsibilities a second tier of sorting out entitlements, such as travelling expenses, to attend hearings. But I will certainly give extra consideration to what the honourable member for Wide Bay has said and see whether that matter can be considered further. While I doubt that I have the power to order ex gratia payments, I am happy to have a second look at it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) made an interesting contribution. He spoke with passion but without relevance. I think he spoke for 15 minutes without uttering a single word that was relevant to the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it does not come as a great shock, I must say. I would like to spend a couple of minutes talking about the question of the assets test as it affects farm families, because this is a matter that has received some publicity and I know it concerns a number of members of this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will make a couple of general points. Student assistance schemes under this government are already generous. This year we will spend over $1.5 billion assisting more than half a million students. Student assistance has developed a lot since the days of the old TEAS and secondary assistance schemes operated by the coalition. I repeat: while it would be very nice and desirable to assist all students, it is not possible to assist everybody nor is it possible to cover all of their costs. Any program must be targeted to those in need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the framework of the already generous&mdash;but targeted&mdash;arrangements, extra concessions that are available to farming families are available to no others, as has been pointed out during the debate. The children's boarding allowance for isolated families is not subject to the assets test. By a decision of cabinet last Monday week, the additional boarding allowance was extended to those over 16, supporting the government's contention that there should not be barriers to rural families enjoying the benefits of full secondary education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An additional concession for farming families concerns the assets limit. This year, the assets limit for non-farm families is $369,000. For farm families it is twice that amount at $738,000. The value of the property for assets testing purposes is reached by subtracting the value of a farm family's homestead, the two hectares curtilage and the amount of any debt. After that, a farm family can still hold assets of up to $738,000 and qualify for Austudy. The assets test is waived in cases where the parents are receiving social security benefits or farm household support. These are additional concessions extended to farm families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question arises: is the $738,000 a reasonable limit? On the evidence available, I believe that it is reasonably realistic. As compared with the honourable member for Maranoa's own figures, it is not an unreasonable limit, particularly given that in drought affected areas one would expect that the value of assets would fall. Therefore, using the honourable member's example, a farm of that value in a drought affected area would be expected to produce a lower valuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the financial year 1993-94, 208 farms in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia were valued for Austudy assets testing purposes. Of the 208 tested, only 33&mdash;less than 16 per cent&mdash;had a total value of more than $738,000. One would have expected that, after the kinds of deductions that I have already explained, very few would exceed the assets limit. </PARA>

The rate of rejection on the grounds of assets for farm families is one per cent, which is the same as the rate for the general population.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I concede that where a problem exists&mdash;many members in this House believe that a problem does exist&mdash;it may be exacerbated by two factors. One factor is a less than complete awareness by farm families of the generous concessions which apply. The second factor is that some farmers may be self-assessing themselves out of the system and not applying for the concessions because they believe that their properties are worth more than the valuation given by the Australian Valuation Office. There may be some people out there whose estimates of the current value of their properties are unrealistically high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an attempt to remedy this, as part of its discussion last Monday week, the cabinet decided that the government should embark on a strategy to raise the awareness of farm families of the benefits that are available and of the conditions that apply. I expect this will involve writing to farm families, giving them detailed information, giving them the opportunity to make personal inquiries and inviting them to test their eligibility by applying for assistance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the last listed speaker on the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill, it is my responsibility to say some things about the progress of the debate thus far and to put on record, with respect to the broad approach taken by the coalition, the government's position on one of the most important pieces of social justice legislation ever passed by the Australian parliament. I rise to speak as someone who has had a very long history of involvement with this particular proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, whilst looking through my collection of papers from my early years in parliament, I came across a discussion paper in which I had advocated the creation of a national land fund to my caucus colleagues way back in 1986. As events unfolded, that fund was not supported. But it is certainly a great source of pride to all members of the Keating Labor government that, as our primary second stage response to the High Court decision in the Mabo case, we are delivering to the parliament this historic legislation. We would have hoped that it would be unanimously supported by the whole parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my responsibility to inform the House that, following consultation with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and with representatives of key Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations, the government will not be accepting the opposition's proposed amendments to the Aboriginal land fund legislation. To do so would be a breach of faith with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people&mdash;a position which the government is not prepared to adopt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After a great deal of careful consideration, we will reject the opposition's amendments for a number of key reasons. Firstly, there has been some formal advice from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. I will refer to that formal advice in the course of my remarks. Secondly, as I think every member of the Australian parliament would know and as the great bulk of the Australian population would know, there has been very strong and overwhelming opposition to the amendments from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders and representative bodies across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will also reject these amendments because there has been a total lack of consultation between the coalition and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people on the proposed changes. Finally, we as the government see a fundamental inconsistency between some of the amendments and the nature and aims of the land fund and the fact that the intent of other amendments will be automatically incorporated into the operation of the fund as the legislation currently stands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has honoured the undertaking given by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and me that the coalition's proposed amendments would be seriously considered. This is despite the difficulties posed by the fact that the legislation has been before the parliament for two months and that the government&mdash;indeed, all parliamentarians&mdash;received only general notice of the proposed amendments yesterday and was not given the final detail of some amendments until this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, which is the government's primary source of advice on indigenous affairs, has formally advised the government:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ATSIC is strongly supportive of the Bill as it stands. It believes the Bill is consistent with the implementation of a strategy directed at land acquisition and ensuring sustainable land management, so as to provide economic, environmental, social or cultural benefits for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is important to emphasise the extent of opposition to the stand taken by the coalition, not only in relation to its specific amendments but also to the general approach the coalition has taken. Charles Perkins, the Acting Chairperson of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, needs no introduction to this House. Even the coalition would have to agree that his public comments about coalition policy have been balanced and constructive, particularly in recent times. I think it is instructive to refer to the detail of what Commissioner Perkins said in a recent press release:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . ATSIC supported the . . . Bill in its current form which was arrived at following consultations with indigenous peoples and which has their support.</PARA>
<PARA>A very important emphasis is given to those consultations. The press release continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of this country want to know where the Coalition stands on this issue. There is significant concern about the Coalition's motives in moving to amend the Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund Bill. `We believe it is a workable model,' Mr Perkins said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition dealt itself out of the debate leading up to the Native Title Act. If it genuinely wants to re-establish its credentials in indigenous affairs and make a contribution to the process leading up to the formulation of the social justice package next year, it must show that it understands the principle underpinning the Indigenous Land Corporation and the Land Fund.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Perkins went on to emphasise the public accountability requirements, which I am more than happy to deal with in detail later this evening, and finally asked the coalition to declare in unequivocal terms, with no strings attached, its commitment to land acquisition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In making a number of comments on the second reading stage, I will not engage in a personal attack on any individual coalition member. What I have been about as a minister are issues and principles. I recognise that a number of members of the coalition are people of good faith, but the tragedy is that those more moderate members of the coalition have not been able to convince the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) to take a principled stand on the land fund. I intend to put on the public record and make absolutely clear my abhorrence, and that of the government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country, of the tactics employed by the opposition over recent days in relation to the proposed amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not simply a matter of criticism by the government or that of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We have heard criticism by Independents in parliament today. The Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Kernot, made abundantly clear in her public comments her anger about the coalition tactics. She said that the opposition's amendments were a smokescreen and that its position amounts to gutting the fund. Let us look at the informed editorial opinion in this country. The political editor of the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> was scathing in his criticisms of the opposition leader. He said that it was a performance of breathtaking gall. He also stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his somersault to embrace the land fund legislation&mdash;provided the Government accepts a brace of amendments&mdash;Mr Downer is being at best disingenuous, at worst a hypocrite.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say, I think very incisively:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Mr Downer has seized on a tactical manoeuvre to duck the latest threat to his embattled leadership.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, the opposition leader has fallen into the same trap that the former leader fell into in his public statements on the High Court decision, the Mabo case and the Native Title Act. I will say more on that later. It is important to put on the public record that criticisms have come from a wide range of other indigenous people&mdash;</PARA>

It is not me as minister who has been making these comments. Indigenous leaders right across this country have rejected absolutely the opposition tactics in the specific amendments it has brought before this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has also received a public bucketing from the Torres Strait Regional Authority. Getano Lui Junior, a person whom I would have hoped the coalition would respect, made it clear that he was more than satisfied with the very deep public accountability provisions in the current legislation. Of the coalition's attitude in bringing into this debate issues of health and housing, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is confusing citizenship rights with the need for a land and sea base for Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree with him absolutely. I think it is important to remind this House of the efforts of the government to try to secure cross-party support for this legislation. Back in March the Prime Minister wrote to the then Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), and urged him to put forward some constructive amendments on behalf of the opposition. No reply was forthcoming to that letter. The legislation was then introduced into this parliament on 30 June. Despite a further letter from the Prime Minister to the current opposition leader, not one formal reply was forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were many other talking heads out there in the media. I notice that the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) is in the House. I am sure that he will remember speaking on the ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Country Hour</EMPHASIS> on 13 May. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can promise you that Coalition policy is that the Land Fund will be opposed, and that the Native Title Bill will be repealed.</PARA>
<PARA>On 2 June on radio station 4CA, the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) described the land fund as: </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a huge buying spree of $1.5 billion nationwide Land Fund&mdash;I think it's a misplaced priority and I think it will add to the bureaucracy in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA>These are exactly the same kinds of tactics that the coalition bought to bear throughout this country during 1993. Do honourable members remember the speech made by the former Leader of the Opposition about backyards and farmyards? He suggested that somehow the rights of non-indigenous Australians were threatened by the government's proposed legislation. The same kinds of comments are now being made by the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite all the efforts of the government and the formal on-the-record attempt by the Prime Minister to seek cross-party cooperation in respect of this matter, no response was forthcoming from the opposition. What we finally have is a rejection by the government of amendments which we see as a mere smokescreen to diffuse the real position of the opposition&mdash;that is, a continuing rejection of the proposals that the government is putting to finally deliver social justice to this important area of social policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like fair-minded Australians to think about what kind of tactic the opposition has employed with respect to these amendments. It has said to the government that it has a raft of amendments and some, in the words of the shadow minister, are major amendments which change the focus of the bill. The government is expected to embrace and support those amendments. On the other side of the equation, what will the coalition give us in return? What will be gained for indigenous people by our supporting those amendments? Will there be cross-party cooperation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there were to be cross-party cooperation, if there were a genuine shift in coalition policy and it did have an intention to support the basic principles of the bill, the government would have to think very seriously about it. But we have here quite substantive amendments, major amendments in the words of the shadow minister, which are rejected overwhelmingly by indigenous people and which the government is not prepared to accept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that, even if we do accept them, we are faced with the coalition's threat to go to the Senate and move further amendments of an unspecified kind. The coalition has also threatened to derail the whole process of this legislation by sending it off to a parliamentary committee. Let me put on the record that the government will not abdicate its responsibility to indigenous people. The coalition did not consult with one single Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person in the entire country. The government at least tried to seek the opinions of indigenous people by sending out the documents of the coalition. We had to send out its proposals. What a way to run an opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is currently in the process of reviewing its Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs policy. Let me say that indigenous people are going to give the opposition a very strong message: it should talk to indigenous people and listen to what they are saying. Members of the opposition should not come into this chamber without having consulted a single indigenous person, let alone without having undertaken a proper process of consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the House of what we as the government did. We sat down with indigenous leaders. We did not just consult; we negotiated. History will record that that process of negotiation in relation to the land fund was probably as important as the final outcome as it is in relation to this bill. We are seeking to advance the process of reconciliation, which is not done by unilaterally coming into this place and introducing proposals that have not even been the subject of consultation with indigenous people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn my attention to cross-party cooperation and the reconciliation process. If anyone in this country is in a position to say something on the public record about the history of how cross-party cooperation went off the rails, it is me. I will tell this House what the facts are. During the time of the last federal election&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is, and it has been debated in this House. In the course of the last federal election I issued a public statement, which was probably unprecedented, praising the former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth, for his support for the government's approach to dealing with the issue of native title. In an earlier statement, the member for Wentworth had said that the government had a process which would run through to September, and that the coalition supported the government's approach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During that election time we had a flashpoint for democracy&mdash;we had cross-party cooperation in indigenous affairs. Let me say on the public record that, while the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) played an acknowledged important role in bringing the coalition on board the reconciliation process, before the coalition supported the reconciliation process just about every editorial writer in this country, the AMA, the National Farmers Federation, most churches in this country and, finally, the Girl Guides Association of Australia had supported it. The basic point is that we had mobilised and built a ground swell of public support for this important area of social policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, the coalition came on board, and we are grateful for that. After the last federal election, despite the very common purpose we had, we then saw the coalition launch into an appalling display of continued attacks on indigenous people. Do members remember the speech to the nation by the member for Wentworth? Do you remember him saying how we worked hard for our houses, our homes and our businesses as if somehow they were under threat? Every single coalition frontbencher, many of whom are still in their positions, went along with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where were the Fred Chaneys, the Peter Baumes, the Ian Macphees? All those presently in the frontbench stayed silent. They fell in behind the member for Wentworth, including the current Leader of the Opposition. Now we see a repeat of the same thing. It is very tragic that the coalition's stand on these important and sensitive issues of public policy can be driven by a leadership struggle. What a terrible thing for the country. Regrettably, in the current climate we are seeing the rhetoric being won by the moderates but the detailed, hardline policy is being championed, and the battle is being won, by the hardliners in the party&mdash;most of whom are situated on the frontbench of the coalition. Does anyone seriously think that that frontbench would ever move to support a land fund?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, over 20 years ago Billy McMahon was supporting land acquisition by the Commonwealth. In 1974 this parliament voted unanimously to establish a land fund. Now, as a result of the coalition's stand on this bill, we find that the coalition policy is being turned back 20 years. We are seeing an attempt to abdicate the Commonwealth's responsibility for giving effect to its obligations under the 1967 referendum, and we will not buy it. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment simply widens the scope of the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) said that we had not consulted with the Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people. The reason we make this amendment to the bill is that we have been requested to ensure that when money is available it not only goes to corporations but also is available for individuals, partnerships, trusts and other forms of Aboriginal groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An example given to me was that, if a fisherman had an Aboriginal partnership and the partners wanted to get a loan from the ILC to make it an economic partnership, they should be able to ask the ILC for a loan. That is not provided for under this bill. There are other people trying to own land who wish to have some assistance. The widening of this bill does not preclude giving to corporations, it simply is inclusive of individuals. This minister's absolute hypocrisy in this matter is evident, because that was the intention of this government. We are just tidying up the bill. On page 46 of the bill, paragraph 7(c)(jg) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to evaluate or audit the activities of an individual who has received one or more grants or loans from:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i) the Indigenous Land Corporation . . .</PARA>
<PARA>So in the government's own bill it refers to individuals. Paragraph 7(c)(jh) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to evaluate or audit the operations of a body corporate . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The next paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to evaluate or audit the operations of an unincorporated body . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So it was the government's intention. Otherwise, why did it have it in this part of the bill but not in the other part? In doing this, we are simply making clear what the government intended to do. It gives individuals the opportunity to increase their viability by saying to the ILC, `Can we as an individual, a trust or a partnership have a loan?' The government is so hypocritical that it will not even consider an amendment which tidies up its own bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has clearly rejected this amendment for some very simple reasons. I would like to outline them. The opposition's position in putting forward this amendment demonstrates the problem we have had with the way in which it has dealt with this legislation. The shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), has not done sufficient homework to understand what is available at the moment for Aboriginal people as individuals, as trusts or as companies to gain some access to loans or some form of economic support through ATSIC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a demonstration of the fact that the honourable member for Hindmarsh has failed in her responsibilities as a shadow minister to actually learn about her shadow portfolio and to consult with Aboriginal organisations and people around this country. The main argument she put forward for the opposition wanting to change this clause to allow for Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders to individually gain grants of land or loans from the corporation was so that a man who had a fishing boat and wanted to expand his business could gain a loan from this fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the shadow minister had done any research or talked to ATSIC, the principal Aboriginal organisation in this country responsible for administering Commonwealth funds in the area of Aboriginal affairs, she would know that there are already very adequate procedures and funds available for companies and individuals to seek grants or loans to assist them in their economic activities and in establishing businesses. That is the essence of the problem that the opposition now faces. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All too often, those of us in the parliament get rather bogged down with the detail of what is happening here and we lose sight of the overall reasons why we are here. We think very deeply about a specific clause in a piece of legislation, or we may be thinking about the subtleties of our latest committee report, and we forget to take time out to reflect upon the real reasons why we are here and what motivated us to take up the challenge. For me, that is not so tonight. Tonight I intend to make some very general points about women's issues&mdash;some of the fundamental reasons why I decided to take the political path.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women's issues have been issues for many years&mdash;in fact, over nine decades if one looks at our history. However, let us face the fact that the past 30 years have been a great period of change. There have been a lot of accomplishments in advancing the status of women in Australia and there have been some great improvements in the areas of women's employment, education and health and their increased visibility in public life. These reflect the accomplishments most dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the labour force participation of women has been a major area of change. Now, 53 per cent of married women are in the labour force, and women make up 42 per cent of the labour force overall. Access to senior secondary and tertiary education by women has improved markedly. It is a noted fact that over 82 per cent of girls are now completing year 12. Women's ordinary time earnings&mdash;that is, excluding overtime&mdash;are 84 per cent of men's earnings for full-time workers, and statistics demonstrate progress since 1983 which is now narrowing the gender wage differential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Special services for women's health, including breast and cervical cancer screening programs and birthing services for indigenous women and women from a non-English speaking background, have been introduced. Special programs have been introduced to address violence against women and to promote a fair and accurate portrayal of women in the media. These have been developed in response to a very strong community concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Progress has certainly been slow, but women are most definitely more visible in public life. We have accomplished much, but lots of key areas of concern remain. I suggest that, so far, the greatest challenges have been ensuring that structural adjustment in the economy does not disadvantage women, that opportunities within restructuring are used to promote the advancement of women and that social investment to increase women's choices is encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Priorities for improving the status of women in Australia probably could be represented as follows: women's representation in public life and in decision making&mdash;that is, getting women into decision making positions should be a matter of priority; women in the law, with particular emphasis on the elimination of violence against women; women's participation in economic structures; and addressing the needs of Australia's indigenous women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the speech that I have given so far has been taken from an overview of where women are that was done by the Office of the Status of Women. A paper was also delivered to the parliament this week on women and superannuation. I would like to comment on a couple of statements in this paper which are very pertinent in this area. The paper states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Superannuation and retirement incomes are matters which are of interest to most Australians but of particular interest to women for many reasons. We need to look at how to resolve the erosion of small superannuation account balances and reduce multiple accounts of workers who change jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>This affects women most of all. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The clear message is that there are a wide range of issues to be resolved, with many of these requiring a joint effort and cooperation of government, employers, unions, superannuation industry, families and women themselves.</PARA>
<PARA>There you have some of the reasons I am involved in the process. Let me tell you this: there are not enough women; there should be more.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I would like to bring to the attention of the House a survey which was posted to every Landcare group in Australia by a senior member of the coalition. The survey, along with an attached letter, is clearly a political document which questions the government's stance on Landcare and pushes what could loosely be termed as the coalition's primary industry policy. There is nothing wrong with that in itself, but this bulk mail-out to every Landcare group in the country&mdash;2,200 to be exact&mdash;was done using envelopes, presumably in all cases, from the New South Wales Department of Conservation and Land Management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I realise that the New South Wales government, the Fahey government, has been under a bit of pressure of late with by-election disasters. There was the 10 per cent swing in the Parramatta by-election last week, and it has been digging other holes for itself. But to get caught up with an administrative blunder&mdash;that is to be kind to it&mdash;is quite inexcusable. The member in question is the Deputy Leader of the National Party, the shadow minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson). In my view, he should be ashamed of himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely the federal coalition must be getting pretty desperate if its sloppy administrative management is sending out politically motivated surveys using official state department stationery. One then has to question which department funded the stamps for the return envelopes addressed to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello). But then, of course, we all know that the National Party has a special place in Australia's political history when it comes to bulk mail-outs. How far does something like this extend? How many other federal coalition members are using state departments around the country for the party's political gain? How much campaigning has the party done using the services of a state government department?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, of course, the survey raises questions about the dubious methods used by the coalition to develop political artillery, with more leading questions and answers than a barrister during an examination-in-chief. Take question 11, for example:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Do you believe Commonwealth support for Landcare is sufficient?</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How would you describe the adequacy of Sections 75(b) and 75(d) of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which provide write-offs in the year of expenditure for approved on-farm conservation works? Inadequate, adequate or adequate but could be improved.</PARA>
<PARA>Question 7 gives a detailed run-down of the coalition's tax credit system used in the last election. I would have thought that the last thing the coalition would be worrying about was taxation policy in the last election. Then the honourable member for Gwydir had the effrontery in his covering letter, which, I might add, featured his own letterhead, to write:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not my intention in writing this letter to politicise Landcare&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and he then went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . although the Coalition will not be backward in making the point that more needs to be done in terms of delivering assistance directly to farmers who undertake approved on-farm conservation works.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise the sad if not tragic saga of Mrs Sylvia Faulkner and her husband Reg who are involved in a longstanding fight for compensation from the Commonwealth. This matter has been mentioned many times in this place by members and senators from both sides. Earlier this year the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) refused a last ditch appeal from Mrs Faulkner for an ex gratia payment or, better still, an independent inquiry into her grievance. The Attorney, relying entirely on the advice of his department, decided that Mrs Faulkner's claim against the Department of Defence was baseless and without merit, and her allegations of a miscarriage of justice were singularly fanciful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through a freedom of information request, however, I have uncovered new material which supports Mrs Faulkner's case. Other government documents which have found their way into the Faulkners' hands in just the past two months also add weight to their claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The crux of Mrs Faulkner's compensation claim, which originated in 1974, was that over a period of years the army's engineer-in-chief at the time, Brigadier Charles Flint, had led her to believe that the defence department was going to buy her invention, the Trisal clip. But the sales never eventuated. It took 13 years from the time of the original writ for the case to come to trial&mdash;a travesty of justice! Long before it did, in mid-1987, Mrs Faulkner had been sent bankrupt. She was entirely dependent on legal assistance from the Commonwealth under the Bankruptcy Act, but that assistance was reviewed just eight weeks before the trial, and very strict limits were put on the witnesses she could call. This contributed to her losing the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FOI documents show that in handling the Faulkner claim the Attorney-General's Department relied on advice from the defence department. In early 1987, when the Attorney-General's Department proposed a meagre offer of settlement, this was also vetoed by the Department of Defence. At that time, just a few months before the trial, the defence department argued that Mrs Faulkner's claim was entirely without merit for the following reasons. Firstly, she could not prove she had lent the money to develop the clip. Secondly, she did not hold the patents as claimed. Thirdly, the clip was not marketable and the companies involved were not capable of manufacturing it. Fourthly, the credibility of Mr and Mrs Faulkner was questionable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it came to the trial the Commonwealth's case had completely changed. The trial judgment, in fact, states very clearly that the clip was Mrs Faulkner's invention, that she did hold the patents and that it was a good invention. It questioned who could doubt the ability of international company Vickers-Ruwolt to manufacture it. By then the whole case of the department, and therefore the Commonwealth, was that Brigadier Flint had made certain statements but had not misled the Faulkners because Mr Faulkner had cunningly manipulated him to get him to make these statements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This turnaround was extraordinary but it is easy to understand in view of other documents such as the letter from Brigadier Flint to the Defence Force Ombudsman dated 2 September 1975. In that letter Brigadier Flint states clearly that he did tell Trisal&mdash;that is, the Faulkners&mdash;that the army was going to buy the clip and that procedures for its introduction were initiated but there were unavoidable delays. He went on to state that his only dealings with Trisal were on behalf of the Commonwealth. That was Brigadier Flint's position in 1975. But a memo from senior officials in the Attorney-General's Department dated 4 February 1987, just two months before the trial, notes that, after fighting for it, Brigadier Flint was going to get his army pension after all. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If that is the departmental position, let's confirm that and inform Flint. Flint should be required to say he acted without authority.</PARA>
<PARA>In the interests of justice, however belated, this whole affair demands an inquiry&mdash;one outside the Attorney-General's Department, which was so heavily involved in this case in the first instance. Therefore, I entreat the Attorney-General to reconsider his current view. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs, having spent some time considering all the evidence and the submissions, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Home but not alone</EMPHASIS>. The title of the report sends a message. It is an appropriate time to review services and care to those who are frail and disabled and also at home, because we must ensure that they are not alone or uncared for. People are living longer and therefore there is an increased number of frail aged in our community, some suffering from dementia. The wishes of the aged to remain in their homes and in the communities with which they are most familiar are now being respected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Deinstitutionalisation is now seen as desirable. But these social and attitudinal changes make demands which must be met. We currently have a situation where the frail aged and the disabled are competing for the same HACC dollars. The terminally ill who choose to be nursed at home, and those patients being discharged early from hospital under new casemix arrangements, add further competition for the same dollars and the same care. HACC is currently a system of funding service providers who do not necessarily work in a coordinated way. A more coordinated approach is needed, and I am confident that the time is ripe for local, state and federal governments to take a good look at this report and the recommendations, and work together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee discovered that there were significant variations in the way services were provided between states. We also found an inadequacy of information and data collection from which the objectives and programs could be measured. There was certainly a failure to be able to measure outcomes. We also met frail and disabled people and their carers, and service providers and peak bodies. The inquiry was advertised in July last year, and almost 400 submissions were received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee conducted some 20 days of public hearings which generated over 3,000 pages of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and evidence. Inspections were held in Sydney, at Nyampa Aboriginal community in New South Wales, and at Broken Hill. A public meeting was also held in Broken Hill. The committee published a discussion/options paper in February this year, with some 3,000 copies being circulated. Well-attended public meetings were then held in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So much really did come out of this. For me, it was a great learning experience and I certainly feel much the wiser for it. I was grateful to the people who came forward, particularly in my own electorate where many of the peak bodies in South Australia are centred. There were those from a non-English speaking background, those who perhaps to a large extent have been neglected because they have been silent. There were people who came here as migrants in the 1940s and 1950s and who worked hard and are now frail and aged, still in their own homes and quite alone, without the same capacity to access services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 81 recommendations which have been made are all significant, but three are most likely to be controversial. Firstly, financial responsibility for post-acute and palliative care should be shifted from community services to health, as a financial arrangement. Secondly, regional community assessment agencies should be established, which would be the only organisations able to approve access to HACC programs. These agencies would also determine the kind and quality of home support required by post-acute and palliative patients. Thirdly, the report recommends the complete rationalisation of the program, initially on health boundaries which would also include other aged care programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Casemix is certainly a topic for public comment at the moment. Casemix is resulting in patients being discharged earlier, but that is not necessarily a bad thing because technology is also improving. I note with pleasure that the South Australian government, in its most recent budget&mdash;perhaps pre-empting this report, or perhaps taking a lead&mdash;has put aside a significant amount of money which will go straight into this program to care for those patients who are discharged from hospital early. That is an example of some thorough planning, because it is no good sending patients straight from hospital wards back into the community without assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard evidence, and perhaps it is really no-one's fault, of elderly patients who were discharged on, say, a Friday, and who were discovered by a neighbour on Tuesday, having not had food in the house over the weekend. We need to involve the general practitioners in planning discharges from hospitals. At the moment, they are not entitled to a Medicare rebate if they go into a public hospital to see a patient; they cannot receive any financial recompense for doing so. I personally think this is one area that needs to be looked at, because if we take up this whole idea of caring for people in the community, and if we involve those whom the patients know best, then the general practitioner is certainly an important person in that whole process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly grateful to the peak bodies, to the people who came to see me in my office and also to those who turned up at the public hearing. As I have already said, there was significant participation from a large number of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past, when people became very old and dependent, they ended up in nursing homes. That has all changed and there is now a willingness to see that it is not necessarily desirable. However, those people who have been particularly independent throughout their lives, and who are unaccustomed to asking for assistance, will often do without and suffer before care is provided. HACC has just been a system of funding. It needs to be a system that is well coordinated and that enables people to receive information about the type of care that they are entitled to. I hope that the service providers, governments and interested people will note this report and that the federal government will act on it. I also hope that the state governments will see it as an opportunity for cooperation so as to ensure the best outcome for Australia's ageing and disabled population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to have had this opportunity to speak to the report. I offer my thanks to the committee staff who, at all times, were cooperative and helpful. I commend the other members of the committee who, 99 per cent of the time, behaved in a bipartisan fashion and who recognised the needs of the electorate before any of their own particular biases. I certainly found it a very worthwhile exercise and I am pleased that I now have a better understanding of the needs of the ageing population in my own electorate. I have had further contact with the disabled in my own electorate, as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak on the report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Home but not alone</EMPHASIS>, which has been tabled in this place this week. I must say at the very outset that this review is certainly due, as no review into this program has been conducted since it began in 1986. The report is certainly long overdue in that respect. This program is well worth while.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should always be remembered that the area of home and community care is incredibly diverse and that there are different situations calling for different solutions. There is no hard and fast recipe for the delivery of the best home and community care, but this report does indicate some very helpful solutions to some very complex problems. The report makes over 80 recommendations, all of which will be helpful for improved delivery of home and community care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most important and constructive aspects of this report is its recommendations on post-acute and palliative care. The evidence that we collected certainly seemed to suggest that more and more home and community care resources are being used for post-acute cases. It does seem that many in the HACC community believe that increasing early discharge from hospitals is driven largely by the budgetary interests of the hospital rather than the individual interests of the patient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the potential for problems in this area, this report recognises that the same level of care needs to be continued after HACC recipients have been discharged from hospital. The report recommends that the same care providers be maintained for the HACC recipients after they leave hospital, that is, immediately they leave hospital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Numerous examples were given to the committee throughout our deliberations of patients who, when discharged from hospital, were given a clear indication that they were not the responsibility of the hospital or the health sector any more. This is the reason the committee felt it was essential to ensure that the care at home for the HACC client be recognised as part of the ongoing treatment for the acute episode, with no less medical responsibility than the care conducted in the hospital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that the best way to address the problems in this area is to change the financial responsibility for palliative and post-acute care from community services, which currently deals with it, back to health. This will provide a one-stop shop. It will remove the cumbersome duality of dealing with both the health system and the community services program. It will remove the problem of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing when dealing with the same patient. It will also&mdash;and most importantly&mdash;remove the `It's not my responsibility; it's theirs' attitude, which seems to have dogged the delivery of a coordinated and sustained service in the hospital and after discharge. The recommendations of this report provide a structure which is far more simple and logical than the one which exists at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regionalisation is an aspect of the report which is logical and certainly well needed. HACC service deliverers at the moment range from incredibly small community services to some organisations which run services throughout the entire state. They are very diverse in their size and their operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry bore out the fact that the regional boundaries which were used by state and Commonwealth departments were constructed in an arbitrary manner and were essentially a bit of a shambles. The locality distinctions that exist between health, aged services and HACC mean that a lot of the data collected, in holistic terms, was meaningless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a definite trend in the state sphere for health services to be regionalised, giving to each region an individual budget and a greater deal of say over how that budget is used. For instance, my state of Tasmania is divided into three regions for the purposes of health service delivery: the north, the north-west and south. They all have their own pool of funds and all have to provide a certain level of service. How they use these funds and deliver that service is fundamentally up to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of health regionalisation and the fact that the boundaries of health assets and transport systems are regional, it is totally logical that home and community care be dovetailed to reflect that regional structure. This would mean that the Commonwealth boundaries for the provision of HACC and other services such as aged care and nursing home and hostel services would mirror regional health structures. This is a logical and very simple step. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may have to be some tinkering around to enable compatibility with census collection districts but, essentially, it will mean a move from arbitrary boundaries, which are not reflected by the provision of services which should go hand in hand, to real boundaries on a geographic basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, transferring such a service to a regional entity must mean that a regional budget holder is established alongside a regional review and complaints mechanism and fully functional regional forums. The emphasis that we heard on this through the hearings was that those regional forums need to be fully functional. The report I speak to today makes definite provision for this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The holder of the regional budget could take a number of forms. It could be a joint Commonwealth-state group, wholly and solely a state group, or a community body which has been appointed by the two tiers of government. One factor remains paramount in the establishment of this process: whatever structure the regional budget holder takes, it must be totally autonomous and free of any interference by state or federal governments. The key point of this recommendation is that none of the normal home and community care services would be funded on a state-wide basis. This would make the service free of state government interference. Autonomy over HACC funding would be given to regions. This would allow those individual regions to develop their own methods of service delivery which were the most efficient for that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important and far-reaching recommendation of this report, however, is the establishment of the regional community assessment agency. This agency would be responsible for a region, with the state health regions that are already in existence as the starting point. This agency would become the only access point to home and community care services and would take over all the current functions of the aged care assessment team. The central point of this recommendation is to avoid duplication of services by the agency having sole responsibility for the determination of where resources will go. It will also have the ability to use those resources most efficiently by being able to contract out its functions to other agencies. For example, the regional community assessment agency could choose to contract out its powers in a small town to a disability assessment group which already exists. This ability to contract out has a number of advantages. It will enable the use of more specialised staff such as interpreters on a needs basis. This will ensure cultural and language sensitivity as and where it is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This agency would use staff who are trained appropriately for the specific task that they will undertake. Work will not be conducted outside the specialty area of the individual. This agency will perform the incredibly important role of determining the needs of those being discharged from hospital who require home support. This goes to the central core of the problem of casemix and early discharge. The use of this specialist and expert agency to assess home support needs of individuals will certainly make sure that hospitals are not merely discharging their patients early to save a few bucks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the areas of the report that I view as being very pleasing is the particular attention it pays to the needs of access to HACC by special needs groups. It recommends that a national policy be developed to provide access to HACC services for people from a non-English speaking background. It is well known that people from a non-English speaking background do not get their fair share of health services for one reason or another. This report will go some way towards addressing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank my colleague opposite, the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), and other members of the committee for, firstly, the learning process that I actually went through with that committee and, secondly, for their support during our deliberations. I would also like to thank the reporting staff from Hansard and the secretarial staff that assisted us throughout our deliberations nationwide. It is a well worthwhile report. I believe it is one of the most excellent reports that I have seen during my time of interest in these areas. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure for me to rise for the first time in this second chamber. On Monday, the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) tabled a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Home but not alone</EMPHASIS>, which should become a landmark in providing community services to the people of Australia. This report follows a report over a decade ago entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In a home or at home</EMPHASIS> that was chaired by the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay). That report was the genesis of the home and community care program. It is certainly very timely that this far into the program we should be having a look at a review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As shadow minister for community services, I congratulate the chairperson and the members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs who have produced this report. They have produced a report that is comprehensive in its scope, benefiting from extensive public consultations and hearings and producing recommendations that are both wide ranging and thoughtful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a document that federal, state and territory governments would be foolish to ignore because collectively they have responsibility for the management of the home and community care program. The committee's report highlights many failings and shortcomings in the management and delivery of HACC, some of which I will consider in a moment. But let me say now that the existence of this program, and the goal of allowing as many as possible elderly and functionally disabled people to remain in their homes and in their communities, is not questioned by me or the coalition. The federal coalition supports this objective and, of course, six of the eight state and territory governments that deliver HACC services are coalition governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's report makes it clear that there is overwhelming support for the HACC program and for its future. Minimising the need for residential care is a characteristic of a society which cherishes and values its members regardless of their age or their infirmity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, HACC does have many success stories. Let me talk about the city of Box Hill, a municipality I represent in the federal parliament. It delivers a comprehensive home and community care service and it does it very well. Box Hill adopts a holistic approach to its services. For example, the city uses its own nursing staff to provide acute care in the home, along with the more traditional HACC program services. It complements the work of the Box Hill hospital and other acute care hospitals as in-patient stays become shorter. It has got a successful disability support program, and the key word of this program is `flexibility'. The city can react to consumer and care needs effectively and deliver services with the greatest possible efficiency and least financial cost. Jenny Nelson, the home and community care coordinator for the city of Box Hill, manages the city's home and community care services. She, her colleagues and the service providers and volunteers with whom she works are just some of the thousands of quiet heroes of the home and community care program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But as the standing committee report demonstrates very conclusively, the current overall state of home and community care is not so healthy. Its effectiveness is greatly impeded by a whole range of factors, including a lack of clear objectives and no sharply defined picture of the types of consumers in the functionally disabled group it is meant to service. There is considerable duplication of functions between Commonwealth, state and local government, with the inevitable consequences for efficiency and quality of services to consumers. There is a lack of strategic planning and outcomes standards. Insufficient information and advice is available for consumers and carers, and the program is simply not coping with the stresses of the advances in acute care and reduced in-patient treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to touch briefly on three of these points: duplication, the relationship between acute and community care and the recognition of carers. First of all, duplication of effort seems to be the most profound weakness in the home and community care program. This is a frustrating, but understandable, result of a program which involves Commonwealth, state and territory governments as full partners under the HACC agreement, and which also involves local governments such as the city of Box Hill in the delivery of services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Put simply, there are too many cooks spoiling the HACC broth. The Commonwealth gets bogged down in the finer detail of who provides what services in given states beyond the broad strategic and financial management that one would expect. The states, which have the day-to-day program management responsibilities within their jurisdictions, find the Commonwealth guidelines and priorities mean that they do not have as much freedom to make the allocation decisions they would like, which they believe are most appropriate to the needs of their residents. Local governments, which provide about 20 per cent of HACC services, are not even recognised in HACC agreements except as part of a state's overall funding effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This can lead to confusion on the part of government and non-government service providers about just who they are responsible to in terms of provision of services, and to whom they are financially accountable for their funding, especially given the crucial importance of Commonwealth-state matching funding. What is more serious, however, is that such an overlay of bureaucracy and red tape diverts precious taxpayer resources from the consumers they are intended to benefit: the frail aged, the younger disabled and their carers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major theme of the committee's report is the need for a more strategic framework for the HACC program under which the Commonwealth, in consultation with the states and territories, provides a broad strategic direction and sets national program priorities. If this is allowed to happen, the states can get on with the job of providing high quality and well targeted home and community care. Perhaps then we will see the states and territories more likely to meet their matching funding obligations under the HACC agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With things as they are now, it is not altogether surprising that there has been a growing tendency for at least some states and territories to underspend their commitments, leading to the withdrawal of federal funds. To put this in some perspective, ACOSS has estimated that, to the end of 1992-93, federal and state spending has fallen short of promised commitments by $150 million. That money would have bought a lot of needed services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such issues could have been taken up usefully in the context of the recent COAG meeting, but seem to have been lost in the impasse over the effects on the states of the Hilmer competition reforms. This, now, is a challenge for a federal government to take up. I hope this federal government takes it up but, if not, the following federal coalition government will take it up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Something that took up much of the committee's time, and which featured in many of the submissions and public evidence it received, was the growing inability of HACC and other community based schemes to come to terms with the overwhelming pressure of clients requiring considerable post-acute care. This is something the Australian community needs to confront as the duration of in-patient treatment continues to decline, due to such obvious things as casemix funding and less obvious factors such as less invasive surgical techniques, advances in antibiotics and other medical and surgical advances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Institute of Health calculates that between 1982-83 and 1991-92 the average duration in hospital dropped from 6.9 days to 5.0 days. That is a big drop. It is reasonable to suggest that the average stay would probably be less now. Critics of casemix funding will argue that this reflects the considerable disincentive effect of casemix treatment on the way hospitals approach their patients but, as the committee rightly points out, this trend to shorter hospital stays considerably predates the introduction of casemix. What it reflects more is society's rapid strides in medical technology and treatment, but it does not take away from the fact that discharged patients in the HACC client group still need to convalesce and are expected to convalesce at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In most cases, these people and their carers need priority access to home and community care services, often at the expense of other eligible people. While the statistics on the quantity of post-acute home and community care are imprecise, the anecdotal evidence gathered by the mid-term review of aged care, and now this committee, is a convincing indication of the growth in demand for such services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the committee not only identifies the problem but comes up with some possible solutions, including making discharge planning an integral part of a hospital's care of its patients; the committee's proposed regional community assessment agency working with hospital and service providers to develop and purchase suitable post-acute care packages; and, where HACC services were provided prior to hospital admission, ensuring continuity of service provision wherever appropriate. The continuity of care from acute episodes to post-acute care is something to be encouraged, not ignored. These recommendations are some of the most positive to come out of the committee and they have my support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Encouraging hospitals to become more committed to discharge planning and giving full recognition to the acute care experience is only part of a patient's healing process, and it is something I welcome as a medical practitioner. In the last couple of days I have consulted with several groups, including the Council on the Ageing and Aged Care Australia, which also welcome the committee's recommendations. State and federal ministers and policy makers should not dismiss these recommendations lightly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A highly significant group of people whose needs and frustrations are brought out in this standing committee report are the carers of people with functional disabilities  eligible for HACC assistance. By carers I mean the hardworking and loving parents, spouses, partners and other relatives and friends who give up some or all of their time and resources to care for someone close to them who cannot cope on his or her own. It is a term that has become rather blurred in recent years, particularly as governments apply it to a wide range of other people and service providers who professionally or voluntarily become involved in the caring process. I think that is an enormous pity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Carers Association of Australia told the committee that carers are fundamental to and represent the cornerstone of community care&mdash;a succinct statement, but one that is very true. It too often seems, however, that carers&mdash;who are included in the HACC agreement's defined target group for the home and community care program&mdash;are overlooked when it comes to delivering HACC services and in making decisions about a priority for assistance under the program. When the competition for scarce resources is most intense, a focus on those most frail is understandable but in some ways unfortunate. I believe that the standing committee's report reflects a growing community realisation of the value of these unpaid personal carers who, out of love or personal duty, perform a difficult and challenging role without which the community would be much the poorer. Translated into financial savings, their services have to be worth billions of dollars a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's report makes clear that carers need to get a better deal under the HACC program in a range of areas such as actual hands-on assistance in their caring tasks; a better understanding of the services available for those that they are caring for and for themselves; a greater voice in how HACC services are planned and delivered; and, most importantly, reasonable access to at least some regular respite care from their highly intense responsibilities to allow them to carry on with those responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The availability of respite care is overwhelmingly the greatest concern of carers and carer groups. Many of these carers are elderly husbands and wives who may not themselves be in the best of health. Other carers, often daughters, are younger but have the additional stress of raising families of their own, let alone the never-ending task of making ends meet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk of carers we risk taking them for granted. They are not a race of superhuman beings; they need support and love just as much as those for whom they care and, indeed, as much as anyone. The coalition believes that the contribution of carers to the wellbeing of Australian society should not only be recognised but should be tangibly and positively assisted. In government, we will be looking at ways of ensuring through HACC and other avenues that carers receive a fair deal from the community in return for their own commitment. Improving and expanding respite care and other support and information services for carers is a priority for us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the meantime, the committee has recommended that the Commonwealth, states and territories look at improving respite care delivery through greater research into the target group of carers, the service needs of carers and the extent to which carers can gain access to HACC services. That is a recommendation which I welcome. I also welcome the report's recognition of the invaluable role of the Carers Association of Australia and other voluntary and community sector organisations in supporting carers and keeping them informed of the assistance available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this regard, I note the report's general encouragement of a greater role for volunteers in the provision of home and community care. I can see in the provision of, particularly, short-term respite care and support services along the lines of community visitors in nursing homes that volunteers with basic skills, a little time and a lot of goodwill can play a role which will enrich themselves, those they help and the wider community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report, considered point by point, could fuel a debate in this chamber for far longer than we are going to talk about it today. I congratulate members of the committee. I know myself what is involved in producing a large report. This is an important area. HACC has made a big change to Australia and if these recommendations are adopted it can continue its work for the next century. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Firstly, I would like to say that I welcome the comments from the shadow minister for community services, senior citizens and aged care the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge). Obviously, I was aware that he was following the inquiry of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs and I think his contribution augurs well for the community debate that will now hopefully take place around this report, which is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Home but not alone</EMPHASIS>. In my comments in the House previously I referred to some aspects of the report. I do not want to extend the debate too much in some of those areas, but there are two important issues I want to touch on, and perhaps explain in a bit more detail the committee's thinking behind some of its recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first one of these is what we have called the regional community assessment agency. This to some people could seem to be a large and potentially monolithic organisation&mdash;and, if it were badly designed, badly structured, it could be. But, if one looks at what is occurring now and the kinds of problems that we have with the delivery and the administration of HACC, the fact that the providers of services are also the people who assess the need does pose a potential conflict of interest and it does potentially jaundice the function of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there is the question of the capacity of many of the small providers to be sensitive to language and culture, so they can bring an interpreter into a household where the recipient is from a non-English speaking background, or their carer may be. In many cases the carer is forgotten in that context. Many of the smaller organisations just cannot handle that kind of need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the collection of data and look at the shortfall of HACC, we have literally thousands of HACC waiting lists all over Australia. There is no way we can measure the shortfall or the shortcomings because every organisation has its own waiting list. People go from service to service to service to try to find some capacity, and in so many cases give up in frustration. We had evidence of what we called assistance stress, where people may be assessed four or five or six times for meals, for home modification, for home maintenance, for home care, home support, for personal care, for nursing care, all by different groups, all with a different service. They may have four or five or six different providers of services at different times, and those providers may be replaced from time to time. In that situation, for both the recipient and in many cases for the carer, that can be a very destabilising and dislocating experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect of the assessment process is the fact that we really need to focus on this question about continuity of care between hospitals and the community. The question about casemix that comes forward is: do people really trust the hospitals discharging early? The evidence is overwhelming that early discharge, appropriately handled and supported, is medically sound practice and is good for the community. One of the points I have been making is that there is not much golden staph in people's homes. People are less likely to get ill at home than they are in hospital. Their neighbours are nearby, their friends and families can visit whenever they like, so they are back into a network which is more comfortable, though they really need to be sure the services are there when they need them. But there is a level of concern&mdash;`Am I being discharged to save the hospital money or because it is good for my health?'&mdash;and, while ever that question mark is over it, the whole issue of casemix will be retarded in implementation, and the development of appropriate instruments of measurement, whether they are diagnostic related groups or some other form of unit cost, will be held up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concept that we have tried to tie together is the desperate need for a third party, an independent arbiter, who will be able to assess a patient and assess the home&mdash;not simply assess the patient's wound or surgery or rehabilitation needs but assess the patient's home in terms of its suitability, and assess the capacity of the carer, if he or she has one, on some objective basis. The prime concern of that assessment is for that person, not for the hospital and not for the health system. If one looks at trying to link post-acute care or the hospital experience with the at-home experience, clearly one wants to get that third-party arbitration, and the assessment agency would provide us with that scope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also means that over time we can establish as a country and as communities what we are short of: we can see what form of assessment is made of nursing home hours required and what is provided; we can assess what transport needs are not being met; we can establish accurate barometers and measurements of shortfall. Then governments, both state and federal, and even local, could respond to those, because those needs will be visible and professional. I find it somewhat irksome that a doctor can prescribe a blood test and it gets done, regardless of the cost; someone does not say there is no budget left for a blood test. But, if you want to prescribe some home nursing, that requires a budget; if there is no money you do not get it. It seems to me that that is fundamentally unfair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report does not go to the extent of saying that HACC should be an entitlement. It starts to prepare us for the potentiality of that. I think it is about time that governments faced up to this issue. We cannot keep on talking about the benefits of home and community care and ignore the financial responsibilities. With respect to the establishment of a common assessment group, I have said that these groups can be geographically distributed and electronically interconnected. That is pretty good jargon, I suppose, but it is trying to find the form of words to say that it does not need to be a single body in a single building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It can be a whole series of organisations linked together&mdash;it is important that they be linked to the information&mdash;so that a person is assessed once and assessed professionally. The information would then be available to all aspects of the assessment group. Another issue is that a group can exist in a particular region, so that people in different towns are contactable. The point is that there would be one point of contact, but it would not necessarily be monolithic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assessment can also be contracted out by that group and not by somebody else. However, the methods to be used&mdash;the instruments of assessment&mdash;would be common. Regardless of whether the assessment was being done in a small town or a large town, it would be done on the same basis and the data collected would be available. Having one common group would mean that when a person from the common group goes to speak to someone who might need home delivered meals, that person can also check the house, the carer and the person receiving the meals. In that way, if there is some dementia, or there are some problems with the house, or the carer, that is picked up. The situation at the moment is that many of the services can only assess for their service and nothing else. That shortfall could be overcome with this. With a central database, the original assessment would always be available. If in the years ahead that person's health deteriorated, that original assessment would be available. We would then have a starting point and the deterioration could be understood and recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people may see the assessment agency as potentially threatening but there is no reason why it should be. To try to counter that potential threat we have recommended that there be regional forums to discuss the assessments. This would mean that there would be some level of external accountability to make sure that the assessment agency is not seen as some secret body that has supreme power. Also, the assessments would be reviewable and they would be able to be appealed against. Regional forums would discuss the assessment instrument, so that there would be a community understanding of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know there are other people who wish to speak on this debate and, in the time ahead, we may wish to return to this topic, so I hope it is listed for the Main Committee for subsequent days. The report is now available to the public and, as members get feedback from their constituencies, I am confident that there will be a need to list it again for discussion at some further stage. It may well be that this Main Committee may assist in the process of furthering the debate and furthering the understanding, as members bring forward the responses they are receiving. I think we are the first committee to bring a report here. I thank the Main Committee for that opportunity and I trust that we may return. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member suggests that someone with my lack of hair is perhaps a suitable representative, but that belies my age, I can assure you. Statistics from the 1990 or 1991 census revealed that the electorate of McPherson had the highest median age group of any electorate in Australia. Of course, that adds up when you consider that the area is probably the retirement capital of Australia. Many people come to the Gold Coast region to enjoy their retirement. It is a very suitable place for people to retire: it is congenial and there are many services available for aged people and, of course, the climate is ideal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though we do have many people coming here to retire, that has been changing over time. An increasing number of families are now moving to the Gold Coast. Many of the new subdivisions opening up are housing younger couples. We are aware that approximately 1,000 people are arriving in south-east Queensland every week. They are coming from the southern states for one reason or another. It is because of my interest in aged care in particular that I wanted to make a contribution to this debate this morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I observe that this Main Committee is working pretty well. I think there were reservations on our side about it. Maybe there were even some reservations on the government side, but so far so good. The fact that we have the opportunity to speak to a report this morning indicates how useful this committee can be for that purpose. Reports are tabled in the House of Representatives which are very often important and comprehensive reports, such as this report, and they are the end result of hours and hours of deliberations. Those of us who have served on committees know just what sort of work is involved in putting together a report like this. It is a pity, when a report comes into the House of Representatives, if it is discussed for perhaps 30 or 40 minutes and that is it. This Main Committee will provide an opportunity to give more attention to these sorts of matters, and I believe that is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, members generally need to be aware that this committee gives us the same opportunity to express points of view as we have in the House of Representatives. Although the surroundings are far removed physically, and in terms of the furniture and so on, nevertheless, the impact is there and we can address these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context, I wanted to make a few remarks about this report. I hasten to add that I was not a member of this committee; therefore, I am by no means familiar with the detail of it. When one serves on a committee that brings down a report such as this, obviously one lives and breathes it to a point where one really gets to know the particular subject very well. That is a benefit of being a member of a parliamentary committee. I have served on committees with the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) and I know that he and I agree that it gives an opportunity really to get a grip on a particular subject and to develop some expertise. Some bipartisanship generally results from that as well, because it becomes fairly obvious, when dealing with problems, that the solutions are very much in evidence and it is difficult to disagree about them. So there is a great benefit in that. I congratulate the chairman of the committee, who is here this morning, for the work that has gone into this report on what is, indeed, a very important area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the key objectives of HACC services is to ensure that those services optimise the opportunity for people to remain home, supported by services that are responsive to individual needs. I happen to subscribe very strongly to the view&mdash;and I am sure that members of the committee agree with this&mdash;that it is good for people to be able to remain in their homes for as long as possible. We are not only talking about aged people but also talking about younger handicapped people. Most aged and handicapped people would prefer to remain in their homes. I am sure that the committee was confronted with plenty of evidence of that. Many of us have aged relatives. My mother will be turning 80 next year and she prefers to remain in her own home. Many of us with elderly relatives will experience the difficulty of actually convincing aged parents or relatives when the time comes that they can no longer take care of themselves. HACC services support people who make those choices and I believe that they are choices that people in our society want to make and indeed ought to be able to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the other important thing is that providing these services and financing these services simply makes good economic sense. I do not know where the cut-off point is in economic terms but I imagine that, for a long time, it is very much cheaper to provide these services for people in their homes than it is to provide hostel and nursing home places. I assume that that is the modus operandi. However, there comes a point when people cannot be adequately served and looked after in their homes. Of course, then we need to have an adequate supply of nursing home beds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise this as a concern, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) may want to comment in his summing-up, if he can. I am very concerned about the shortage of nursing home beds. I make this comment in the context of my own electorate, where we have 23 nursing homes and 18 hostels. That is a considerable number and it obviously reflects the fact, as I said earlier, that we have a very large number of retired and aged people. But there are still just not enough nursing home beds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wrote to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) about this problem recently, bringing to her attention the chronic shortage of nursing home beds on the Gold Coast and the fact that there is now a real crisis, with most nursing homes having long waiting lists. In preparing to make representations to the minister, I actually had meetings with a number of the nursing home directors of nursing on the Gold Coast. They explained quite clearly to me just how big the problem actually was. It has reached rather alarming proportions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One particular nursing home director, in her discussions with me, said that she got 10 to 15 applications for residency each week, and that she had a vacancy only when somebody unfortunately died, which happened only twice per month, approximately. Obviously, if you work those statistics out, you will find just how long the waiting list for this particular nursing home was. When I checked around, I found that that was typical of nursing home waiting lists on the Gold Coast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who had been assessed through the process as being suitable for nursing home beds were the people on the waiting lists. By implication they therefore needed to be receiving whatever level of care they had been designated as suitable for. These were people who were adjudged to be no longer capable of taking care of themselves in their own homes, despite the availability of the range of HACC services there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased to receive a letter back from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health, in which he indicated that the south coast Queensland region had been identified by the department as an area of high growth for aged care accommodation, and that advertisements had been placed in the local press last year inviting expressions of interest in providing aged care accommodation and specifically identifying the region as a priority area for the provision of hostel and nursing home beds. I was pleased to read that, although essentially the question I had asked&mdash;how this situation had ever occurred&mdash;remained unanswered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was fairly obvious to anyone with any knowledge of the area that we were experiencing a shortage of nursing home beds and that we would continue to do so. It only needed somebody to be planning adequately for that not to have occurred. It is fine now for us to hear from the government, `Yes, we are aware of the problem; we are doing something about it,' but it is putting the cart in front of the horse to have left it so long. Because there is a considerable lead time in the construction of nursing homes and hostels, the problem will remain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We get all sorts of input in our electorate offices, depending on where they are, but in my particular electorate hardly a week goes by when I do not get somebody contacting me to say, `I cannot get my mother into a nursing home or a hostel. She is at home. She falls over, and she lies on the floor for some hours before Meals on Wheels arrives.' These are serious problems; yet we are in many respects still only reacting too late to actually meet the particular need that exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put those comments on record in the context of this debate, which is about providing services for people in their homes. The preference of the people concerned, and certainly in economic terms, is for them to stay at home. But we need to recognise that in some electorates, such as mine, there is a crying need for the next step in care for people, and that is care in an institution. In any case, we need to recognise that there comes a point when care at home is no longer adequate for people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The frail aged need to be able to move smoothly into that next step of institutionalised care of some sort. There should not be the major disruption and trauma that occur when a couple get to the point of having to face the problem with an aged or invalid parent, or other relative, at home, and not knowing what to do about it, and not being able to get the person into a nursing home or hostel or whatever the accommodation might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The services provided by HACC&mdash;home nursing, home help, Meals on Wheels, community transport and a range of others&mdash;generally assist people to remain in their homes for as long as possible. They also assist carers of people with chronic illnesses such as dementia, which is becoming an increasing problem in our community, particularly as the community ages. Dementia appears to be a product of age in most cases and, as our community ages, dementia will become an increasing problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aspect of HACC services I bring to the attention of the parliament and the parliamentary secretary is some confusion in my mind about the relationship between Commonwealth and state funding. It seems to me that there is a real weakness in the system in Queensland because, although in 1993 the Commonwealth government was offering to increase funding, as I understood it, that required the Queensland government to actually accept its responsibility to match that funding. What I found was happening with HACC services on the Gold Coast was that, although the offer from the Commonwealth was there, the Queensland government was not prepared to accept its particular responsibility and so, believe it or not, the offer of Commonwealth funds was not actually being taken up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wrote to the Queensland Minister for Health, Mr Hayward, about that, expressing my concerns that that was a fact. I do not know whether the committee actually addresses that issue in particular, but I want to put on record my concern that the system, as it is constructed, will not work unless the state government concerned is sensible enough to realise that it cannot look a gift horse in the mouth. That appears to me to be what had happened in Queensland with the growth funding that was provided by the Commonwealth not being matched by the Queensland state government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two particular matters in the report are very commendable. One is the recognition of the particular problem of access to services by younger people with disabilities. This is a particular group that the committee found was being overlooked. Most of the remarks in the context of this debate are addressed to the needs of older people and that is where no doubt the great majority of the services are directed. But I was pleased that the committee recommended that the Commonwealth, states and territories investigate fully as a matter of urgency the reasons for low levels of access to HACC services by younger people with disabilities and that they develop approaches to service delivery to address those causes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other one I was pleased to see was that the committee had addressed the problem of access by veterans and war widows. I applaud the recommendation it has made that access also be provided to veterans and war widows without discrimination. In general, I really appreciate the work this committee has done and I make my remarks in that context. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), I was not a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs that put this report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Home but not alone</EMPHASIS> together but, as the representative in this parliament of an electorate that has an extremely large percentage of ageing people and is a large consumer of the sorts of services provided under the HACC group, I thought it would be important that I make a few comments on it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting listening to the member for McPherson describing the demographics in his electorate. It sounds very much like my electorate of Lyne. Lyne is another electorate on the mid-north coast of New South Wales which is experiencing a major growth in population of people who are moving into the area to retire, which likewise increases the demands and the pressure for the types of services that are provided under the HACC program. There already has been increased demand for nursing home and hostel accommodation, which is probably what we are trying to address in a lot of the areas that this report has covered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge and commend the staff of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs who worked with the committee members in this inquiry and in drafting this report. I think it is important that we acknowledge good work where it is being done. This is a majority report, and I think there is always going to be bipartisan support for the sort of work that is being done by the parliament in trying to improve and upgrade the services to that section of the community that we are focusing on here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for these programs is increasing. Again talking a little parochially, in my electorate I have the areas of Forster, Tuncurry, Taree and Port Macquarie. Over the years there has been a great migration of retired people into those areas. People are being attracted by specific developments such as retirement villages and complexes where there are self-care units, with marginal nursing services being provided in extreme cases; but there are not the follow-on services as far as hostel accommodation and nursing home accommodation is concerned. That problem has always been there, but it is increasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem has not been identified just in my electorate, it is there in a lot of the electorates to which a lot of people are retiring: the population is ageing. Retired people are living longer, and they are living in these circumstances, but now we are getting to a stage where people are having to move back into the cities to find nursing home care. Along with the member for McPherson, I have constituent inquiries about this at least on a weekly basis, if not a daily basis. I hear from family members whose mother, father, brother or sister has been assessed as needing nursing home care, but to get that nursing home care they have had to move out of the electorate to Newcastle or Sydney&mdash;out of the area and away from close family&mdash;to be able to receive that care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Budgetary considerations are always going to restrict the ability of governments, whatever their political persuasion, to be able to provide nursing home care. I recognise that once the government allocates a nursing home bed it then has to provide the recurrent funding to provide the service. Although in the target area of the Great Lakes there is the possibility of 31 beds coming up, it certainly does not do much to service the need: that is in excess of about 150 in my electorate at the moment. We have got to look at how we are going to provide the services and how we are going to look after these people in their homes, but we also have to recognise the work that the carers and volunteers do, and try to offer support to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that aspect, I might just comment about the Meals on Wheels service in New South Wales. I am not exactly sure how things have changed, but I have had a lot of representation lately from volunteers who provide that Meals on Wheels service. I believe it is the New South Wales government that has put into place paid coordinators to restructure the service that is provided by Meals on Wheels. A lot of the volunteers are very possessive of the service that they provide. They are very proud of the service they provide through the Meals on Wheels service, and they have not appreciated the intervention of what I suppose to be the New South Wales health department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently went to the annual general meeting and luncheon of the Forster-Tuncurry group that provide meals on wheels. They have remained an independent and autonomous group, just operating of their own accord, charging a minimal amount for their Meals on Wheels service. They have their own cars, and they have their own kitchen that has been provided within the Great Lakes Shire Council building complex at Forster. They have a full contingent of volunteers who prepare the meals and deliver the meals. They charge at a minimal rate, they do their little bit of fundraising, and they negotiate the cost of the merchandise they buy around the local community to provide those meals. The community is well served by a group of people made up entirely of volunteers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This needs to be borne in mind by government. Government should recognise&mdash;and I think it has been identified in the report&mdash;that government cannot ever replace the amount of work or the type of care that is provided by the many thousands of volunteers and carers across Australia. What we have got to do is offer support to those people with the services that are provided. We have to make sure the infrastructure is in place and the policies are in place to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important part of the whole process of the provision of these services is to provide the backup, the support and the framework for the volunteers and carers to work under. A number of the previous speakers have spoken about the need for respite for carers, not just those caring for the aged but also those caring for people with disabilities. Their families who are caring for them in the home certainly do need the understanding and attention of different provider groups as far as respite is concerned. They are there and they are providing the service 24 hours a day. A lot of paid health and community workers might work an eight-hour shift, they might work a 10-hour shift, but then they step away from it. They are not in that situation after that whereas family and volunteer carers are in that situation 24 hours a day. It is certainly very onerous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as some of the recommendations in the report are concerned, I want to touch on one particular area that was of interest to me and that is chapter 6, which deals with access by special needs groups. I want to comment on some of the recommendations which I support which make reference to remote, rural and isolated people. Obviously, people probably would not call my electorate remote or isolated. It is mostly a rural area with large pockets of population on the coast. When talking about equality of services between the metropolitan and regional areas of Australia, it is important to note that this is being recognised in this report as well. These are some of the recommendations that the committee has made:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Department of Human Services and Health work with States and Territories to develop and implement nationally consistent definitions of the terms rural, remote and isolated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is so there are not any groups in the community which are actually discriminated against. People who live in rural and remote areas should get equality of services as far as the type of service and the breadth of services that are provided go. The ultimate cost of the service is to the taxpayer. The recommendations continue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Department of Human Services and Health, in conjunction with the States and Territories, investigate the effectiveness of various approaches to service delivery in rural areas and, particularly, in remote and isolated areas and develop a rural and remote areas policy which encourages the funding of flexible approaches to service delivery including multiple service outlets with flexibility in the allocation of funds between service types. The policy must address the particular needs of remote and isolated areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that guidelines for these projects in rural, remote and isolated areas take account of the particular needs of these areas and allow greater flexibility in terms of target groups and that staffing levels for the projects recognise the greater demands involved in remote and isolated areas where there are few established services.</PARA>
<PARA>The last recommendation in that section states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Department of Human Services and Health in consultation with the States and Territories investigate the additional costs of providing community care services in rural, remote and isolated areas in order to develop funding models for these areas which recognise any additional costs identified.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very important element of the report. The House really needs to take note of that. In dealing with this report and in responding to it, the government needs to take note of that last recommendation. We must recognise the special needs in rural, remote and isolated areas; we must recognise that there are going to be additional costs in providing the services in those areas but, if we are to maintain a population in Australia that is spread across large distances in the very diverse nation that we are, we have got to be prepared to provide these services and to fund them in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the committee for that particular recommendation. It is terribly important that we do that. We should not forget people who suffer peculiar or different hardships from people in different areas such as my electorate just because they live where they live. They are trying to provide income for Australia and they want to stay in those areas because they are nearer to their families and they are in the environment that they are used to and that they feel comfortable in. Once again, I commend the committee for that recommendation. I also encourage the government, when responding to this report, to take particular notice of that aspect that has been raised by the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In chapter 7 of the report, a couple of recommendations are made with regard to improving continuity between health and community care. Sometimes it is like the Commonwealth-state arrangements, where there seems to be a bit of a gap in communication. I note that the committee recommends that post-acute palliative care and rehabilitation in the community be funded from the health budget. Palliative care is an incredibly important aspect of the services provided. In my electorate, the base hospital in Port Macquarie is developing a rather large oncology unit and we have a large palliative care program going in the Hastings area and also in the Manning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the assistance of the member for Paterson (Mr Horne), who is a member of the government, we discussed with the then health minister, Senator Richardson, the ongoing funding of the palliative care program in the Manning area, which also covers Taree, Forster, Tuncurry, Bulahdelah as the Gloucester area, which are in the member for Paterson's area. The government provided that funding, which I think was over a five-year period, and that is going to mean the maintenance of a very important program in our area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With a little more persuasion, we managed to get ongoing funding for the palliative care program that is provided in the Hastings area, again through the then health minister, Senator Richardson. That is certainly appreciated in the area as, because of the demography, the age of the population, and the location of the oncology unit at Port Macquarie base hospital, there is a great demand for the palliative care program. I have personal experience as far as the carers and the volunteers are concerned, because my father, who is a retired pharmacist, has just been through the training course to work in that palliative care program with sufferers. I commend the committee for that recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chapter 10 of the report is about service delivery and costs. There is a recommendation there that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Commonwealth Department of Human Services and Health investigate any legislative barriers to the participation of the private sector in the provision of HACC services and work with States, Territories, local government, providers and consumers to develop a coherent policy to enable for-profit providers to seek funding to provide HACC services. This recommendation is conditional upon an examination of the relative efficiency of these services and the implementation of recommendations regarding mandatory service standards, external complaints mechanisms and accountability for outcomes and outputs.</PARA>
<PARA>I commend the committee on that particular recommendation. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) and the government generally to seriously consider that, because it seems that that is also a direction that, not just on a partisan basis, governments across Australia are taking in providing these services. We have to look at that aspect of providing these services to ensure that we can continue providing the services in the areas that are needed and to the people who need the services. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to address the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Home but not alone</EMPHASIS>, which reports on its inquiry into the home and community care program. The committee has travelled and consulted widely, with a number of public hearings, forums and inspections being held across the country. As the committee chair, the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), has already stated, there is an overwhelming push from the community for continued involvement in the home and community care program, which I wholeheartedly support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the state and territory governments are also involved in the HACC program, services vary from state to state. In the case of New South Wales, the dual funding process has presented a particular set of problems. The HACC program, I believe, to date has proved to be very successful, although there is room for improvement and streamlining, particularly in the administration of the program's funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the report makes many recommendations, there are three key points: regionalisation of the program; a single access point to the HACC program; and the shift of post-acute and palliative care. The report identifies the target group as people of all ages in the community with functional disabilities and carers. The recognition of this group represents a starting point for the implementation of changes to the HACC program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a fine line between service delivery and cost effectiveness. Service delivery and cost effectiveness are not entirely incompatible, as many people would have us believe. Reducing the quality or irregularity of services does not mean increased cost effectiveness, and vice versa. The focus of the HACC program in this report must continue to be people driven, and not be merely an exercise in making the program more cost effective to the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that the meaning and significance of this report's title is not lost during the debate and in the future. While it sounds like a take-off of a Hollywood blockbuster about a young boy left at home during Christmas, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Home but not alone</EMPHASIS> really does describe the motivation behind the program. In recent years, the government has continued to increase funding to the home and community care program, offering people an alternative to moving away from their homes in areas many people have been associated with for many years. Honourable members from both sides of the House will agree when I say that it is far better for people, whether they are young or old, to be assisted to stay in their own homes than to be placed in nursing homes, hostels or any other form of institution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Home but not alone</EMPHASIS> means exactly that. People, whether they are carers or are being cared for, are not alone. There is support for them, which may come in the form of such HACC services as home care or Meals on Wheels. The home and community care program is designed to complement the daily lives of people who are in need of assistance. I support this report, having been involved with many HACC funded organisations in my electorate of Richmond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My electorate on the north coast, extending from Ballina in the south to Tweed Heads in the north, is one of the fastest growing electorates in New South Wales according to the 1991 census. The north coast urban planning report, released last year, estimates that within 20 years almost 20 per cent of the region will be over the age of 65. The region is a popular destination for retirees and that, along with migration and reduced mortality rates, accounts for the high proportion of the over-65 age group. The region has the highest proportion of elderly people in the state so, understandably, there is a great demand for services provided by the home and community care program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of HACC services in the electorate, with Meals on Wheels, home care and respite services operating in Tweed Heads, Kingscliff, Murwillumbah, Brunswick Heads, Byron Bay and Ballina. Many of these services are run by volunteers. They deliver meals and provide services such as home maintenance to people who are unable to prepare their meals or keep up with the upkeep of their homes and gardens. Not only do these people provide much needed services, but they also provide a smile and some company on a regular basis to people who may not be mobile, or may not have friends and relatives close by. Next Wednesday I will join the Tweed Heads Meals on Wheels and deliver meals to celebrate national Meals on Wheels Day. I hope other members in this House will take the time to do that as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While these services receive funding through the home and community care program, a number of problems arose last year as the New South Wales government refused to match the Commonwealth's offer of growth funds. These cutbacks resulted in a reduction of services to many people who had been receiving assistance for a number of years and were suddenly cut off as services could be delivered only to the most needy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tweed Shire Home Care was one organisation that had to reduce its services this year because of a lack of funding. It provides assistance at home to people who are frail and aged, and younger people with disabilities. Services provided by Tweed Shire Home Care include housework, personal care, respite care, shopping, overnight care and a handyperson. The service provides assistance to over 440 people per month but it has been forced to reduce its customer numbers by 100 because of budgetary restraints. The home maintenance program has also suffered this year as it no longer has the resources to provide the handyperson service. A letter from Tweed Shire Home Care to a HACC public meeting held in June stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Until adequate funding is provided to this high growth area the gaps in service will continue to grow and the needs of this ageing community will not be met.</PARA>
<PARA>One home care volunteer from Tweed Heads commented to me recently that there is no point in assisting a person with meals and palliative care if there is no-one to look after the house or garden. How true these comments were. It is imperative that a full range of services is available or the objectives of the program can never be met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The administration of the program has been a point of much frustration and concern within my electorate. I take the example of the Brunswick Valley Meals on Wheels service which is under the leadership of Mrs Gai Laverty, who has done an excellent job under difficult conditions. It is now operating out of the new Brunswick Valley community centre, which was substantially funded by the federal government. When that centre opened, the Brunswick Heads and Mullumbimby Meals on Wheels organisations amalgamated to form the Brunswick Valley Meals on Wheels Service. Prior to the completion of the community centre, with its very large kitchen, the meals came from the Mullumbimby hospital. In late 1992&mdash;and I emphasise 1992&mdash;it received approval to change to program funding and to employ a food services officer to run the service, which now provides up to 100 meals per day. It has only in the last four months received that funding to employ a food services officer to run the service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might reply to the comments on this of the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), who indicated his slight lack of knowledge of how the program is actually funded. In New South Wales the Department of Community Services is actually the provider of the service on the ground, with federal government funds. It was that change in management, if you like, which took so long for the New South Wales government to implement, which meant that it took more than 18 months for the simple change to program funding for the Brunswick Valley Meals on Wheels service to take effect and for it to employ a service officer to run that service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the last year the Brunswick Valley Meals on Wheels service has managed wholly and solely on the generosity and commitment of its committee and community volunteers. I would like to pay tribute to those people today for sticking to their guns during that period of time. I am not necessarily trying to point the finger at or lay the blame on either the state or federal government; I am merely highlighting the possibility of lengthy delays, which I hope will be avoided, for the recommended regionalisation of the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be successful, the program must be fully integrated. Regionalisation of the HACC program would virtually ensure that people requiring assistance did not fall victims to political decisions but were assessed on their individual situations. Local professionals would be able to assess local people and make decisions about funding priorities in their particular region. The best placed people to make decisions about their local community, I believe, are the people who live and work in these communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A single access point to the multifaceted program, described in the report as the regional community assessment agency, will make the process easier for clients of the HACC services. The establishment of such an agency has the potential to offer clients of the home and community care program a one-stop shop for people requiring assistance through the program. The agency would ensure that appropriately trained people carry out the various assessment stages, which would depend on the individual circumstances and needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The crucial litmus test for the program will be the implementation of the recommendations on the ground. It is imperative that the administration and funding of the home and community care program reflect the needs of the program's client base. I commend this report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of the Grain Legumes Levy Amendment Bill is to ensure that grain legumes used by a producer on-farm for commercial purposes are not exempt for the purpose of research levy payment. Under the present Grain Legumes Levy Act 1985, producers are exempt from paying levy where the total levy payable is less than the leviable amount for that levy year and where the grain was processed by the producer and used on-farm for domestic purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Grains Council of Australia, which is the representative organisation under the legislation, is concerned to ensure that the exemption for grain legumes `used on-farm for domestic purposes' does not include, for example, a grain legume producer who establishes an intensive animal production unit on-farm and sources his stockfeed requirements internally. Consistent with the legislation applying to other grains under the Wheat Industry Fund Levy Act 1989 and the Coarse Grains Levy Act 1992, the amendment clarifies that such commercial operations carried out on-farm are liable for levy payment and facilitates levy collection and administrative arrangements. </PARA>

I really do not know where he got the tie. He will be making the Speaker in the main chamber feel dispossessed if he keeps that up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We support the Grain Legumes Levy Amendment Bill 1994. The bill will ensure that grain legumes and oilseeds used by producers on-farm for commercial purposes are subject to research levy payment. By way of background, the Grains Council, which is the representative organisation under the legislation for these grains, wants to ensure that the current exemption for grain legumes used on-farm for domestic purposes does not include producers who use them for intensive animal units involving, for example, pigs, cattle or chickens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This action will bring these grains into line with other grains under the Wheat Industry Fund Levy Act 1989 and the Coarse Grains Levy Act 1992. Levies from legumes are expected to be down this year. Official estimates are that, because of the drought, the fall-off will be from around $4 million last year to $3.3 million this year. My suspicion is that the outcome will be significantly worse than that, given the fact that the drought is expanding at a truly alarming rate. We have the situation where 83 per cent of New South Wales is drought declared. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legumes on which levies are paid are: field peas, lupins, faba beans, chick peas, mung beans, pigeon peas, peanuts, native beans, vetch, cow peas, and lentils. These crops not only are used domestically but also earn valuable export dollars for Australia. The value of the lupin crop in 1993-94 was estimated at about $255 million and exports were around $100 million in value. The value of the field pea crop is around $128 million and exports of peas, including field peas, chick peas and cow peas, are worth more than $150 million a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Research and development in the area of grain legumes is urgently needed in Australia because, in terms of the need to move towards sustainable production in agriculture, legumes have a major role to play. There are two essential problems. The first problem is the development of suitable varieties, and that includes the issues of disease resistance, insect resistance, yield performance and those sorts of things. The second problem is the one of finding further market outlets for commercially saleable grain legumes. Further market outlets are necessary in order to make the cost of sowing these crops a more attractive proposition, in terms of being able to offset them by returns, given that many farmers out there are struggling to find effective rotations for cereal crops. Legumes are vitally needed as part of that process, but often they are expensive to grow and it is very hard to achieve a return on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to the final point that I want to make this morning. The major environmental issue confronting this nation remains that of land and soil degradation. The key to sustainable land use is, of course, to some extent tied up with the whole philosophy and cultural change that landcare embodies, but landcare is running into some major problems. One problem is the rather bureaucratic nature of the animal as we know it today. The other problem is that, in the end, the capacity of farmers to look after their land, to put right past mistakes and to move to ecologically sustainable production in the future, is fundamentally and primarily impacted upon by their financial viability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The No. 1 need for landcare&mdash;in other words, the No. 1 need when it comes to grappling with the environmental problems we have in this country&mdash;is to return farmers to profitability.

That is probably why he is not participating in the debate on this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Grain Legumes Levy Amendment Bill could be described as an afterthought. It is the government's response to the fears expressed by the Grain Council of Australia that sections of the original bill, which this bill seeks to amend, allowed people who are using legume grain on-farm for domestic purposes to escape any levy. This bill puts beyond doubt that people who use the legumes on-farm for intensive agriculture, intensive animal production, will pay the levy but it still allows people to retain a small amount of seed for domestic purposes without attracting the levy. The amendment is good in that it puts that beyond doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This levy, which is an ad valorem tax levied at one per cent of the net gate value paid to the farmer, goes to the Grains Research and Development Corporation research fund. It is matched by the Commonwealth government grant of up to 0.5 per cent of the gross value of the commodity value of that particular crop. This figure is apparently arrived at by ABARE advice to the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levy is applied principally to lupin and chickpeas but also to peanuts, lentils, soya beans, field peas and native beans. In passing, I might say that it is just as well it is not applied to has-beens, as it would put substantial costs on organisations such as the NFF. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I support this bill, the Grains Council should be aware of the fact that the tax, being a net tax on the farm gate, is a gross tax on the commodity, and one per cent on net value at the farm gate is probably between three or five per cent of the net value of the crop to the farmer. If that is allowed to rise, it could become quite significant, and I think that is something that the council will have to take into account. If it is allowed to rise too much, it will lead to substitution in some areas although the scope for that is not great. But in areas where substitution is available we might see people going into crops such as lucerne, tagasastes or even Maireana brevifolia, a native Australian plant which has not had much promotion in Australia but is being worked on extensively in South Africa. In South Africa it is often used as a high protein plant and irrigated in competition with some of these other alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does seem to me that while the levy is at one per cent there is not going to be any trouble. Research into lupins, particularly&mdash;I single out lupins because I think this is the major crop&mdash;such things as mosaic, its effect on animal fertility, development of cultivars suitable for heavy soils, and other aspects of R&amp;D which are well worth pursuing have the capacity to give a good return to the grower. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, while the lupin crop was worth over $250 million last year, I believe that it has potential for exponential growth in value. Lupins, probably more than any other crop, have a significant part to play in crop rotations and in the fixing of atmospheric nitrogen into the soil by virtue of the symbiotic relation to the rhizobia in their roots. Lupins have the capacity to grow on some very infertile ground, and peat sands are their preferred environment. There are not a lot of other plants that grow as well in these areas and, for this reason, lupins are of considerable value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is hard to speak at any length on a bill as basic as this, which is mainly a machinery bill to amend a perceived loophole, but I would like to say that rural Australia generally has a very important part to play in Australia. We have seen it being played down quite often today. In the areas of CSIRO research we are told that crops in rural Australia are being overfunded. I do not believe that this is the case at all. If one looks at the funding of CSIRO, a lot of the 40 per cent of funding that goes to the rural sector is in fact for downstream processing, which would be counted by other agencies as manufacturing and not as agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a serious drought in eastern Australia. I must say that I am very lucky that I come from Western Australia where we never have droughts. I do, however, recall that we had 10 crop failures in 11 successive years without attracting the same attention that the eastern states get. However, in the west we get used to that, and I guess that is what makes Western Australia the premium lupin state and the leading innovator in agriculture in this nation. </PARA>

The Grains Council of Australia, as I said in relation to the earlier bill, the Grain Legumes Levy Amendment Bill, is the representative organisation under the legislation for these grains and it wants to ensure that the current exemption for oilseeds used on-farm for domestic purposes does not include a producer who uses them for an intensive animal unit&mdash;pigs, cattle, chickens, or whatever&mdash;on a farm or, alternatively, sets up a manufacturing industry, for example a margarine plant, to gain an unfair advantage.

I suspect that there will be a dramatic increase in the sowings of summer crops, and if it breaks soon enough that may include sunflowers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to rise in support of the Oilseeds Levy Amendment Bill this morning. This is the appropriate place as it is a non-contentious issue and we have the agreement of the opposition on this bill. Although it is a widely held view, especially in media reports, that there is a lot of disagreement in parliament, most primary industry legislation goes through with agreement, and I know the government makes an effort to consult with the opposition on these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Oilseeds Levy Amendment Bill 1994 has the majority support of the industry and the Grains Council of Australia. It is aimed at ensuring that all the producers of reasonable quantities of oilseeds and all those who use the oil for commercial profit pay the levy. There were anomalies in the previous act and that meant that some producers, who may have been using oilseeds for other areas of commercial operations, could avoid paying the levies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It meant that these producers of commercial quantities of oilseed could have gained the benefits of the industry and government funded research and development of oilseeds, without contributing in a proper way to the research and development costs. It meant that they were gaining the benefits of research into crop development without cost. It meant that other producers who were paying their levies were paying for more than their fair share. So this bill is really about improving the equity of the oilseed levy collection. It is about ensuring that those producers who gain an economic benefit from the research and development of oilseeds pay their way. I do not think there is any scope for argument against that rationale of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When presented with bills of this nature, I am sure it is important that the intended consequences of the legislation are borne out. I note that some other legislation along these lines, the Cattle Transaction Levy Act, was brought in in 1990. That was brought in supposedly to gain greater equity through the industry. It had the support of the Cattlemens Union and the Cattle Council, and it gained the support of the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, John Kerin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry had argued, and I think reasonably, that the levy collection system prior to that&mdash;the slaughter levy&mdash;was unjust. It was argued that, in many areas, producers were escaping payment of the levy because they reared cattle, sold them and never actually sent them along to slaughter. That argument was sound. It was simple. It was unfair that the only person paying the levy was the last person to own the beast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry came up with the new proposal, the Cattle Transaction Levy Act, and it suited many people. But, on the north coast of New South Wales, the inequities were still there. The producers there, many of whom had previously escaped the slaughter levy, were, and continue to be, put at a disadvantage because of the new levy. My electorate covers an area where cattle change hands a number of times. It is not uncommon for a beast to change hands three or four times. That means that the flat rate levy has a greater impact in an electorate like mine. When the levy was originally introduced, it was set at a level of about $6 a transaction. If the beast changed hands four times, it meant that a beast returned a total levy of close to $24. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other inland areas, notably western Queensland, the beast often attracted the once only transaction levy of $6. Despite arguments to the contrary, it meant the producers in my own area were having to cut their profits per head to match other producers who, by simple fortune of location, had their cattle change hands only once. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation has changed a bit now, because the levy has been cut down quite a degree, but I think the disadvantage is still there. I see that there are still inequities in the transaction levy which we need to avoid whenever we are devising new levy systems. It is important, in discussing these levies, that there has been proper consultation with the industry as a whole, and I think that case bears that out, because inequity is still there, which the transaction levy was supposed to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week I wrote to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Bob Collins, suggesting that consideration be given to altering the system of levies for cattle involved in home slaughter. My attention was drawn to this after being approached by a constituent who had been out of work for a couple of years. He had been a butcher and he had been helped to gain work through the CES and the new enterprise incentive scheme. He had started his own business to get off the jobsearch allowance and he was butchering beasts on the property of the owner, but he has been told by the AMLC that a levy is payable when the beast is slaughtered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wrote to the department saying that there should not be a payment due because the beast had not changed hands. I was told that the levy should only be applicable once for each owner, but in the same letter the department countered its own argument by saying that the person performing the home slaughter should charge the transaction levy to the owner of the beast. That argument seems pretty hollow to me. In almost every instance the owner will already have paid the levy when the beast was purchased and is now being forced to pay it again during slaughter. I believe that an ad valorem system would have been much fairer and involves very little extra effort in collection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that, when we are considering changing levy systems, we need to be very much aware that the changes are going to increase fairness and equity to all producers. I think that neither the slaughter levy nor the transaction levy is really fair. I am satisfied, however, that the bill we are considering this morning does meet that equity criterion. It brings the levy system for oilseeds into line with levies covering the wheat industry and the coarse grains industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The summary of the legislation provided to the government and the opposition says that the Oilseeds Levy Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 provides for amendments to the Oilseeds Levy Act 1977 to ensure that oilseeds used by a producer on-farm for commercial purposes are not exempt for the purpose of research levy payment. The amendment is being made at the request of the Grains Council of Australia, the representative organisation under the act. The council did make it clear to me that it was fully supportive of the bill and its passage through the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Grains Council has asked the parliament to support changes to the act in the past, most recently in 1992, when the levy system was changed from a specific rate per tonne to an ad valorem system to improve its equity. At that time the request also received bipartisan support. I think it is incumbent on the parliament to ensure that this equity based amendment also receives quick but considered passage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Oilseeds include sunflower seed, safflower seed, soya beans, rapeseed, cotton seed and linseed, which are mainly grown for their oil content. The main areas of oilseed cultivation are the central highlands of Queensland, western Victoria, the south-east of South Australia and the New South Wales north coast. On the north coast of New South Wales, soya bean is the main crop used in oilseed production. A report from the New South Wales Department of Agriculture in 1991 detailed quite extensive research on soya bean development. This is the type of research that the levies we are discussing this morning would go to fund. Soya bean variety trials have been conducted each season at several localities on different soil types in coastal soya bean growing areas. Growing conditions and soil types in most of the coastal regions were shown to be conducive to high yields. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The research shows that varieties with strong tolerance to excess manganese and probably tolerance to delayed harvest weathering and sclerotinia provided the best results. Further tests showed that the post-maturity weathering has caused serious losses in growing yield and quality in most soya bean producing areas of both New South Wales and Queensland. It found varieties which were less susceptible to rain-induced late harvesting, most notably dune. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point in mentioning this is that research of this type will produce results which will be applicable to all soya bean growers. It is imperative then that all commercial producers who gain the benefits from this type of research do contribute to the funding. That is why this bill has important ramifications and I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have spent half of my life in the country and I have never heard of it! The purpose of the Coarse Grains Levy Amendment Bill 1994 is to change the basis on which research levies for barley and triticale are paid from a specific rate per tonne to an ad valorem rate. At present, the Coarse Grains Levy Act 1992 provides for the imposition of levies on oats, cereal rye, sorghum, millet, maize and canary seed at ad valorem rates, and barley and triticale at specific rates per tonne, as recommended by the Grains Council of Australia (GCA) and, in the case of triticale, the Triticale Grain Association of Australia (TGAA), which are the representative organisations under the act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These levies can be increased by regulation up to a maximum rate also specified in the act. The levy rates for barley and triticale are currently $1.10 per tonne and $1 per tonne respectively. The levies attract matching Commonwealth contributions as provided for under the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change is being implemented at the request of the GCA, with the agreement of the TGAA with regard to triticale, and is intended to make the payment arrangements more equitable. The ad valorem levies proposed would ensure that growers' contributions to research are proportional to their net returns from the relevant crop. In other words, the amount of levy payable in dollar terms will be directly linked to the grower's capacity to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change will standardise payment arrangements for all coarse grains and also bring them into line with other grain research levies applying to wheat, oilseeds, seeds and grain legumes which are all levied on an ad valorem basis. The GCA and TGAA have recommended an initial operative levy rate of one per cent of the net farm gate value and a maximum rate of five per cent for both barley and triticale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In line with the change from a specific rate to an ad valorem basis, any exemptions applying will now be expressed in value terms and all references to leviable weight have been omitted from the legislation. The change to ad valorem based levies is not expected to result in any significant change in the Commonwealth's dollar-for-dollar matching contributions in relation to barley and triticale as current specific levy rates were set at the equivalent of one per cent of net farm gate value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is intended that the new levy basis will take effect on 1 October this year, if possible, to coincide with the commencement of the first quarterly collection period of the new crop year for barley and triticale. If the amending legislation is not effective by that date, it will not commence until 1 October 1995, to avoid changing the levy arrangements during a crop year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opportunity is also being taken to effect a minor drafting amendment to the legislation which will avoid confusion that has been occurring amongst some levy payers regarding their liabilities in respect of oats and rye harvested prior to 1 October 1992 but delivered or processed after that date. I commend the bill to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief, because again we support this legislation. The Coarse Grains Levy Amendment Bill 1994 seems to me to be one of those clean-up actions that one of the previous speakers on the other side made reference to. Essentially it changes the basis for assessing research levies on barley and triticale from a flat rate per tonne to an ad valorem rate, which brings the arrangements for these products into line with oats, cereal rye, sorghum, maize, millet and canary seed. It is appropriate that this be done, it is fair that it be done, and therefore we support it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Grains Council of Australia and the Triticale Grain Association of New South Wales have recommended the change as a fairer system which would ensure that growers' contributions to research are proportional to their net returns from the relevant crop instead of being a flat rate regardless of the price received. Both organisations have recommended an initial operative levy rate of one per cent of net farm gate value, and there is a maximum rate in the legislation of five per cent. It should be noted that this is five per cent of the net farm gate value. It should not be confused with the 0.5 per cent of the gross value of the product, which is the maximum amount for dollar for dollar funding for the government research and development funding arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those research and development funding arrangements enjoy very strong bipartisan support in this place, and it is really quite interesting to come up into this place&mdash;as contrasted with our other place&mdash;where we can agree on almost everything in primary industry. We will go back down there to argue on some of the areas where we have major disagreements, but I have been interested to note here the comments about the importance of the rural sector of the Australian economy. Barley is a contributor to that. Production in 1993-94 was valued at $925 million, exports at $464 million. Exports of barley this year will have fallen through the floor. They will be absolutely minuscule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The eastern drought is a severe drought, no ordinary drought, and we need to draw that distinction. We need to highlight the unbelievable effect that drought is having on production based primary industry, which has already been hit very hard by the unbelievably difficult economic circumstances that agriculture faced in the 1980s. Now, in many instances&mdash;consider, for example, the Darling Downs&mdash;some of the most productive agricultural land in Australia is devastated. In some instances farmers there have lost up to eight crops in a row. I heard the other day of one individual who had 100 per cent equity in his farm four years ago, but is now down to 40 per cent. He has not had a crop now for four years. He is basically finished unless a responsible package can be put in place to ensure that when rain does come he has a means of clawing back his position, winding back that debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are facing an extraordinarily serious problem. I understand that the total loss now to the Queensland economy alone is estimated at some $3.6 billion, and the loss to the New South Wales economy at about $1.5 billion. Again it is a huge figure, and it is set to get much worse if the drought continues to bite. Yesterday we saw the area covered by drought declarations increase to the point where 83 per cent of New South Wales is in drought. Not all of that is severe drought, but in areas it is a severe drought. It is a natural catastrophe of extraordinary proportions which is threatening entire rural communities. That, in turn, is threatening their capacity to contribute again to the nation's economic wellbeing and export performance, even when rain does come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think a very clear point needs to be made at this stage. There is an assumption that, when rains come, rural industries simply get going again. They plant crops somehow and they mysteriously restock their properties. I believe that there are huge numbers of farmers across this country who will simply not be in a position to do that when this drought breaks. Their financial position is so fragile, and the country is in such a mess, that it is just not going to happen. The potential downside for the nation is absolutely enormous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning briefly to the bill, triticale is a cross between wheat and rye. It is used mainly for animal feed. We grew it for the first time in this country in the 1970s. I have looked at it; I have found it an interesting crop. It seems to perform better in slightly harder soils than we have at home. I would not say that it has become an enormously important crop in the overall Australian context. Nonetheless, it does have its place in the array of feed grains. In 1992-93, the crop was worth some $36 million, which I guess is not an insignificant amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year, levies from coarse grains raised just over $7 million. This money is being used to help Australian farmers stay ahead through excellent research work. That is very important and, as I indicated, it is an area where we do have strong bipartisan support for the arrangements in place. This is extremely significant in the sense that Australian agricultural production and performance has been to the forefront in this nation in terms of improving performance on a year by year basis. That effort can be maintained only if, on the one hand, farmers are viable and, on the other hand, scientific research effort is kept up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current levy on barley is $1.01 per tonne and on triticale it is $1. The new rate will be one per cent of the value of the grain. This amount can be altered by regulation up to a maximum rate of five per cent of sales value. I have no doubt that those organisations would never move to that sort of rate because their constituents would scream long and hard. I would make the observation that in one sense the timing is just a little unfortunate. The new rate of one per cent on barley this year is likely to mean that the rate will be significantly above what it was. Barley, for the first time in a few years, is likely to be worth significantly more this year than it was last year but farmers will not have very much of it. On that note, I conclude with the observation that we do support this bill as we supported the previous two. It is very nice to be able to join members on the other side on a bipartisan basis. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the previous speaker, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), has indicated, there is bipartisan support for this Coarse Grains Levy Amendment Bill as would be expected. By way of background, triticale is the name of a grain developed by crossing wheat and rye, as previous speakers have indicated. Significant commercial production of triticale commenced in the 1970s. The present uses for human consumption are: flakes for muesli; flour and wholegrains, especially in breads; and the manufacture of triticale macaroni. It has been claimed that triticale has an advantage over bread wheats in highland areas in acid soils and in areas where drought tolerance is needed. However, there is no evidence that triticale varieties in Australia survive drier conditions better than wheat or that they are resistant to stem rust. Varieties of triticale have been shown to do well in heavy and acid soils.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levies imposed by the Coarse Grains Levy Act 1992 were imposed by the Commonwealth. It requested the coarse grains industry itself to match Commonwealth funds up to the maximum 0.5 per cent of the industry's gross value of production. The principal uses of the proceeds raised by the levies included funding research and development and health and safety. It is estimated that the receipts from the coarse grain levy will total $7.077 million and $6.602 million in 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation has bipartisan support. I follow the Deputy Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Gwydir, and I find it a little bit unfortunate that he once again sought to use this occasion to criticise the government in relation to its drought policy. Drought is obviously something that is of great concern to rural areas in Australia. It is very fortunate that my electorate does not suffer that problem at the moment, but there are lots of areas in my state of Queensland as well as areas in New South Wales that are suffering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was very disappointing in the House yesterday when the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the honourable member for Rankin (Mr Beddall), set out the government's policy in relation to drought and set out the considerable amount of support that the government is providing, and the response from the coalition was, `Not enough, not enough'&mdash;a sort of mindless response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth approach to drought is based on the national drought policy and its principles of sustainable development, risk management, productivity growth and structural adjustment in the farm sector. Consistent with the national drought policy, the Commonwealth has established a number of long-term measures to assist farmers to prepare for the risk of drought, including the national property management planning campaign, drought related research and development, the income equalisation deposit, farm management bond schemes and, very importantly, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would be aware, the rural adjustment scheme. As you would know, the rural adjustment scheme has several legs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first I refer to is the exceptional circumstances provision which clearly comes into play in relation to drought. It is just very strange that the coalition would choose to criticise the government about RAS, because RAS has been around for a long time. I am not sure, but I think it was the Fraser government that brought in RAS. Certainly, it has been supported throughout by the Hawke and Keating governments. The exceptional circumstances provision of RAS allows for short-term target assistance to long-term profitable farmers to cover exceptional circumstances, such as drought, which cannot reasonably be expected to be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, the government also provides assistance under the normal RAS to improve the productivity of enterprises when they can be shown to be profitable in the longer term, and for education and training to improve farm management skills and professional advice. In addition, re-establishment support of up to $45,000 may be available for those farmers whose long-term prospects are poor and who wish to leave farming. Farmers in need who wish to remain in farming but are unable to demonstrate that they can be profitable in the long term might be eligible for a jobsearch allowance or farm household support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there are three basic legs for farmers. If they are in a situation of short-term exceptional problems and they suffer drought, they have assistance through the exceptional circumstances leg. If they are in a normal situation and need structural adjustment, it is provided by RAS. Obviously, drought is a factor that cannot be discounted from that. If it is a factor, then they can also apply. With those farmers in really dire circumstances, in circumstances where it would not matter whether there was a drought or not, circumstances where one is talking about really marginal farms, I would have thought that there would be some bipartisan support there. That provision comes where people, unfortunately, mostly end up in the social security system under jobsearch or farm household support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">RAS is administered by the states in accordance with policy guidelines provided by the Commonwealth. In New South Wales, it is administered by the Rural Assistance Authority; in Queensland, by the QIDC. It is interesting that there has been some comment about the fact that, when looking at our six states, there are differences in terms of the outcome of RAS. Basically there are different authorities, so there is a different outcome in terms of lending. We hear the coalition time and time again talking about states rights, and this is an inevitable consequence of giving this up to the states. I think it is something the Commonwealth can look at, because there are very clear discrepancies between the different state authorities in terms of lending policies and RAS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, that is something that should be worked out on a cooperative basis between the states and the Commonwealth; it is something we have to look at. If a farmer in Western Australia is eligible under RAS and somehow a farmer in New South Wales or Queensland is not, that is a problem. But I do not know how the coalition gets around it if it supports states rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth is also providing a network of rural financial counsellors who provide free and confidential financial advice to farmers. Normal social security benefits are also available to those in the rural community who are in financial difficulties. In response to the extended drought in Queensland and north-west New South Wales, the federal government has allocated $14 million in additional emergency financial assistance to drought affected primary producers in those states. This package includes the immediate provision of an additional $2.5 million in exceptional circumstances funds to Queensland, which I referred to earlier, and $5 million in exceptional circumstances funds to New South Wales. That continues until 31 December 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for further funding beyond 1994 will be the subject of a review in November 1994, following the receipt of a report from the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council. We are not saying&mdash;and we have never said&mdash;that that is the end of drought assistance. RAS is an interest subsidy scheme and there is not a determinate figure. Obviously, there have to be continual reviews to make the scheme work, and that is sensible. So when coalition members interject in the chamber`Not enough' it reflects on them and not on the government. The allocations of Commonwealth expenditure that have been provided under RAS since September 1992 total $47.2 million&mdash;but the coalition says `Not enough'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, a $5 million pilot extension will also be made to the training and skills enhancement task project in Queensland and New South Wales. This project is aimed at the development of the provision of training, including a wage subsidy for farm employees in drought affected areas, and it will assist in retaining farm management skills in rural areas. This government is concerned about farmers, but it is also concerned about farm workers. You do not hear the coalition talk very much about farm workers&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Lyons is probably correct in saying never. It is very unfortunate that because of technological change we have not got a lot of farm workers left in Australia. Twenty or 30 years ago in my electorate that would have been the major source of employment. Very few people are now in farm employment, but there are still some. Obviously our sympathy goes out to farmers, but another unfortunate effect of drought is that workers are put off, and the government is also concerned about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, $1.39 million has been provided for the expansion of financial and family counselling services in drought affected areas, including provision for a communications program to improve awareness of assistance available to the farming community. This is very important, because drought has not only a financial impact but also a very strong emotional impact on families. Drought affects families, whether they are farmers or farm workers, and the government recognises that. The government has a very proud record in dealing with a very difficult problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Party seems to believe that buckets of money exist in government. When you are out of government for 11 years, you suddenly think that government has got this unlimited money pot. Obviously, our government would like to provide more, but, given the financial restraints on the government and its deficit reduction strategy, I think the Commonwealth government can stand proud for its response to the very difficult problem of drought. It reflects on the coalition that it would make the kinds of statements that were made in the House in question time yesterday and by the Deputy Leader of the National Party the honourable member for Gwydir, today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, I support this legislation. It is important that, although we deal with problems of drought, we still address the future of rural industry and questions such as research and development, because that is obviously the key. I said on a previous occasion that one of the reasons we have got a vital and vibrant rural industry in this country is that we have concentrated on research and development. That is something we can be proud of. This bill continues that tradition, and I support the legislation before this chamber. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HE4">Mr ANDREW</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Wakefield)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (12.15 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate and to respond briefly to the remarks made by the member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd). The bill before the Main Committee, which is the Coarse Grains Levy Amendment Bill, as other speakers have indicated, changes the basis for research levies on barley and triticale from a flat rate per tonne to an ad valorem rate. This will bring these products into line&mdash;as others are well aware and have indicated to the Main Committee&mdash;with oats, cereal, rye, sorghum, maize, millet and canary seed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Grains Council of Australia and the Triticale Grain Association of Australia have recommended the change as a fairer system which would ensure that growers' contributions to research are proportional to their net return from the relevant crop instead of being a flat rate, regardless of the price received. Both the Grains Council and the Triticale Grain Association have recommended an initial operative levy rate of one per cent of net farm gate value and a maximum rate in the legislation of five per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fundamentally, we are here in bipartisan support of this legislation because it offers farmers a fairer way of making a contribution to research. I note that all of the bills that have been dealt with before this Main Committee this morning&mdash;the Grain Legumes Levy Amendment Bill, the Oilseeds Levy Amendment Bill and this bill&mdash;have been supported because fundamentally they go about providing a fairer way of offering that collection of funds for research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to refer to those bills, as they have been passed in the chamber, but I think it is reasonable in the context of this bill to note that, whereas in the case of the Grain Legumes Levy Amendment Bill the arrangements fundamentally were to ensure that intensive industries were picked up and made a contribution but that the contribution was not made unfairly, the same sort of analogy can be applied to the bill currently before the committee. The purpose of the bill is to make the levy collection fundamentally fairer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As all speakers have indicated, the state of affairs in rural Australia as of August-September 1994 is not pretty. As the member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) has indicated, 83 per cent of New South Wales has been declared drought stricken, and parts of northern New South Wales and much of Queensland are going into their third or fourth year of drought. That has some bearing on this legislation, because triticale was originally generated as a grain seed that was seen to be more drought resistant than wheat or barley. That has not proven in practice to be entirely the fact, but the reality is that triticale is now sown in a number of areas where some rotation is sought and where a level of drought resistance is needed in whatever grain is being used for research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am familiar with triticale&mdash;although not personally&mdash;because the farmers in my area, the Mallee area of South Australia, chose it as an alternative crop to wheat and barley in the early stages of triticale's development. As has been indicated in this chamber, the area currently sown to triticale runs at something like 120,000 hectares, generating about $36 million. While triticale is now principally used as a feed for pigs and poultry it also has, I have discovered, some application in the breakfast cereal industry and is used as flakes for muesli, and for flour and wholegrains in specialty breads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Triticale has been developed as a grain to meet the unique nature of the Australian farming environment and the propensity that this country has for droughts. I also note that this bill has a particular emphasis, as the preceding bills to it have had, on research, because the levies being collected are being collected principally for research, especially into better ways to grow grains and legume crops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a comment or two about research in Australia, and I am choosing to take remarks given by Mr Julian Cribb, who is known to all of us, and who delivered a speech at a rural crisis conference in Murray Bridge last week. About his concern for Australian research he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our task is to make Australia a world supplier of information about food, farming and environmental care&mdash;but first we have to get it right at home.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will be necessary for farm organisations and local governments to supply much of the essential information their industries need&mdash;especially about markets, technology and business management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have an untapped treasurehouse of native Australian plant and animal species which we have virtually ignored as farm industries for the last 200 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To underline the national lack of interest in our biological resources, I note:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* the world's largest producers of Australia native wildflowers are Holland and Israel</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* the world's largest eucalypt farmers are Brazil and China</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* Portugal is the world's largest producer of eucalyptus oil, the Chileans are selling us blue gum described as `Chilean oak', and the Finns are selling gum trees to Africa</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* Thailand is farming barramundi, mudcrabs and tiger prawns</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* Africa, Israel and America are the biggest growers of our desert shrubs.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Cribb continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These examples clearly show the opportunities which other, smarter, nations see in Australia's biological resources.</PARA>
<PARA>I am not standing here making a criticism of the government in that context. Rather, I indicate the need that we have as a nation to expand our research base, and acknowledge that the bills before the House this morning will allow us to do just that through the collection of additional research levies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the present picture of rural Australia may not be a pretty one because of the reality of drought that we cannot escape, on a decade by decade sequence, the other simple truth is that we know better than most of the world how to weather a drought. The need we have is for further research so that we can better face these sorts of difficulties and so that we can sell this sort of research to other countries, rather than having them exploited, as Mr Cribb has indicated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to pick up a comment or two made by the honourable member for Leichhardt. I was a little surprised at the level of indignation that the member for Leichhardt expressed about what he saw as the coalition's reaction to the government's drought package. With respect, I suggest that were the roles reversed&mdash;I know that is almost beyond the imagination of those opposite&mdash;there would have been as much criticism levelled at the coalition in government if present government members were sitting in opposition and being lobbied by rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge the member for Leichhardt's comment about the drought package that the government has in place, but I put to honourable members that it is extraordinary for the member for Leichhardt to be indignant that any opposition should call out for more. As he himself said, `Quite obviously, we'&mdash;that is the government, I presume&mdash;`would like to provide more.' Quite obviously, we, as the opposition, have an obligation on behalf of all Australians to ask for more. That is not to say that nothing is happening, but in light of what is happening, and in light of the present level of the difficulties being faced by rural Australia, it is hardly surprising&mdash;there is hardly any call for apology on the part of the opposition&mdash;that it should be asking for a little more consideration. After all, those of us with rural electorates&mdash;on both sides of this chamber&mdash;represent areas that have seen farm debt go from something like $6 billion to $17 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our constituents&mdash;the people of the nation&mdash;spend, I am told, $10 billion every year chasing slow horses and dogs, and only $3 billion on the research that we need to expand Australia's technological base. The nation itself has not yet captured the need for research that we believe is so essential. But we face the simple reality that 200,000 farms existed in Australia a quarter of century ago, and that number has fallen to 110,000. Rural Australia, right now, is bearing the brunt of what has been a necessary readjustment initiated by the government and backed by the opposition, but it is carrying that brunt along with the burden of a drought. It is in that context that, without apology, the opposition said yesterday, `Thank you, but could we have some more?'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Coarse Grains Levy Amendment Bill, about which the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) made some comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The readjustment which is taking place in rural Australia is also taking place in most work sites and manufacturing areas throughout this country. I know that in my area of Tasmania there are opportunities to be taken up when change is made, especially growing potatoes and other crops. These changes&mdash;and some are major changes&mdash;need to be faced by the farming community, even though changes are not always easy to face, and it is up to us within the parliament to make sure that we are positive about the changes. The rural sector has to change, in the same way as manufacturing and many other industries have to change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Wakefield made a good contribution, especially in relation to research. I believe that research is the key to our future. Research and development was lagging far behind, but this government, over the last 10 years, has put it high on its agenda. The government has a great opportunity through the taxation system to support R&amp;D, especially in the rural sector, and I believe that that opportunity is untapped. The honourable member put on the record a quote about some of the areas in which other countries have taken up native Australian plant and animal species and are utilising them industrially to great value for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill, of course, provides amendments to change the basis on which research levies are imposed. In this case it is in relation to barley and triticale, which I am not overfamiliar with. I am very familiar with barley, having sowed many a bag of barley on the family farm as a 13- or 14-year-old working on the header. Ours was basically a dairy farm, and we grew barley for feed in the piggery and in the dairy. I understand that triticale is a cross between wheat and rye. These days it is used as a feed grain for pigs and poultry; it is consumed as flakes in muesli; it is produced as wholegrain flour for specialty breads; and it is used in the manufacture of triticale macaroni. That must be interesting&mdash;I have never tasted triticale macaroni. There are a couple of other tastes that I will have to try. I am always interested in finding a new taste for my palate, and that sort of macaroni is one I will have to look out for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levy will go from a flat rate per tonne to an ad valorem rate in accordance with the value that is there. The levy will be based on the percentage value of this product, which is around one per cent of the net farm gate value. The levy revenue attracts matching Commonwealth contributions and it is used to fund research programs for these grains in the Grains Research and Development Corporation. This has all been done with the approval and the agreement of the growers through the Grains Council of Australia and, of course, the government talks to the industry that is involved. It is not expected to result in any significant change to the Commonwealth matching contributions dollar for dollar in relation to these grains, as current specific levy rates were set at the equivalent of one per cent per farm gate value, as I mentioned before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The research into grains such as barley is particularly important to growers in Tasmania. Members may not be aware that Tasmania has always grown a lot of barley. The background to the industry starts with early settlement in Tasmania, and members would be well aware that Tasmania fed New South Wales for quite a long time. We are very keen to continue to remind people in New South Wales that they would probably have all died out if Tasmania had not been there to grow the grains to feed them. We fed them on grains such as wheat and barley. The wheat in Tasmania can never be grown as hard as it can be grown in mainland Australia, so our wheat is more often used in the biscuit manufacturing side of things, rather than in making a very sharp flour for breads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1860 we were growing cereal crops over an area of about 26,000 hectares, producing about 38,500 tons. In 1993 the area was around 26,700 hectares, producing 67,000 tonnes, so we have increased our production per hectare considerably over that period. Today, barley is the main cereal crop, and production has been as high as 40,000 tonnes per year. Over 50 per cent of the cereal crop is produced in northern Tasmania, and a lot of that is grown in my electorate of Lyons. There has been a major expansion in barley production in recent years because of the Kirin brewery contract in Western Australia, and this led to the activities in the processing sector over the last two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tasmanian breweries use about 6,000 tonnes of malting barley and this is likely to increase. For instance, in April of this year, a decision was made to reopen the barley malting plant in Devonport. This move will see the demand for locally produced Franklin malting barley increase from about 5,500 tonnes to more than 8,000 tonnes annually. These two breweries are now using the barley, and there is a likelihood of an expansion in this area because of the success of both the northern and southern Tasmanian beers, which are being exported all over the world. There is quite a competition between the north and the south these days. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may have tasted the two beers. They are being exported to the UK, the US, and now into China, I understand, so Tasmanian beers have an international reputation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that genetic stock from the very good Tasmanian malting variety Franklin is being used to assist in developing a new cool country barley for growing in other parts of Australia. It is a useful variety, because it requires a long growing season and it has resistance to barley yellow dwarf virus, which seems to be the major disease that affects barley. More research in these sorts of projects will certainly be very useful and, of course, can come from these types of levies. For instance, the high protein content in the Tasmanian barley this year, because of the unusual weather conditions, may have affected the state's exports. Apparently a high protein content in barley is not all that good when you get into beer making and brewing, and research into the quality control of protein levels would certainly assist the farmers in Tasmania. Alternatively, there may be other uses for this high protein material. For example, it can be used for malting for other uses than beer brewing, and in food additives, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of major processors are specialising in feed for the expanding aquaculture industry. As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, the aquaculture industry is an industry that has grown enormously in Tasmania in recent times, and barley is the basis for producing food for the salmon and trout industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was an announcement from a New Zealand company about the latest dairying ventures, which will include a new herd in the north-west of the state. There is likely to be 1,400 milkers added to the expanding dairy industry in Tasmania. Barley has been used as an initial feed supplement and it could take part in this expansion. The dairy industry in Tasmania has a very bright and strong future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tasmanian feedlots, although not as big as mainland feedlots, would still provide a useful market and an outlet for some of the barley in the Tasmanian scene. Of course, there is the traditional barley use of the Irish&mdash;juice of the barley, Johnny Barleycorn, good old-fashioned whisky. Tasmania has some of the best water in the world, so why not convert some of that into making juice of the barley, as the Irish would say?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was in Scotland I visited a number of distilleries that used the Scottish mountain water, and I wondered why Tasmania was not producing some of the great highland dew that Scotland does. I heard only the other day&mdash;and I was reminded of my travels&mdash;that someone was starting up a distillery in Tasmania. I have not heard the details of that yet, but it has been on the drawing board for a short time. Hopefully, that will be another industry using barley coming out of Tasmania. If the Japanese can go close to reproducing an accepted whisky, I am sure that Tasmania could do likewise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legislation like this really assists in the research into the right sort of barley that we could use in that process to add another product to the state's exports and value adding. Barley growing could have a really good future in Tasmania, and our state government should recognise that there is a need for some infrastructure and support for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The farmers are reminded of how&mdash;when they received the contract to Western Australia in recent years&mdash;they were going to have great difficulty in loading their crop, because all we do in Tasmania is import. We import some wheat, and so we have the Grain Elevator Board, which is about taking grains out of ships; it is not about loading ships. So those farmers used their initiative and used one of the woodchip conveyor belts to load the ship with barley. Last year, to load their crop they actually developed that a bit further and put a hopper on the end of it so that they could blow it into the ship's hull. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The growers also bought and put together their own dryer so they could dry their crop to make it even better and value add to it. So they are doing a lot themselves to increase their opportunities. The state government, which is in charge of that sort of infrastructure, needs to look long and hard at the support that it is giving to the barley growers of Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is talk of the Grain Elevator Board being sold by the state government. I believe that would be a backward step. There is certainly a need for storage, loading and unloading facilities to assist the Tasmanian barley farmers. The state government is certainly not looking to do that in any positive way, but rather is going backwards in its thinking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the projects funded by the levy have assisted, I understand, the growing of faba beans as an alternative grain legume crop in serial rotations in the northern midlands of Tasmania, so another opportunity may exist there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another opportunity lies in getting the quality focus on the grain industry development program for Tasmania. It is the quality that we would be looking at achieving, and it is through these sorts of levies and the research they finance that we would be looking at making some gains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a study of the extension of minimum tillage practices&mdash;or none&mdash;for a cereal program. This, of course, would bring about enormous savings in diesel fuels and machinery. There is also the possibility of research into yellow dwarf viruses in winter cereals, especially oats, and it is really these levies which make this sort of research possible on an ongoing basis. There are lots of opportunities for research in the industry, and these research levies will become more and more important for keeping us competitive and for increasing exports from Tasmania, even to the mainland.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2)(a) Australia has lost 20 native mammal species in the last 200 years, which represents half the total lost in the world in that period. Reliable figures for losses over the last 500 years are not available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) No, 30 native mammals are listed as endangered in the Commonwealth Endangered Species Protection Act 1992, not 123. A further 18 are listed as vulnerable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) The first nationally agreed list of Australian endangered vertebrates was adopted in 1980. It is therefore not possible to indicate whether more species have become endangered since 1984 than in the preceding decade. However it is significant that population decline of many endangered species has been halted or reversed by the application of research results, and the implementation of conservation management.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Government has significant responsibilities and powers in the area of the environment. The Commonwealth Government seeks to give effect to its environmental objectives and obligations through a number of laws and programs and through cooperative arrangements with the States and Territories and local Governments throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth has available to it significant environmental management expertise from within its own Departments and Agencies which is supplemented from time to time by the expertise of the Australian academic and professional communities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In developing an answer to the honourable member's question consideration had to be given to the range of activity that could properly be described as corporate services.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Housing and Regional Development was however, only established on 25 March 1994. Negotiations are still continuing with the Departments of Finance, Human Services and Health and Industry, Science and Technology on resources for the Department. Resource figures for the Department are therefore only indicative and could be subject to change at a later date. Moreover, the Department does not have an expenditure history to enable it to identify and quantify corporate services activities in accordance with the Conroy Report definition. The Department's answer below includes all expenditure contained in the Corporate Direction and Support Program of the 1994-95 Portfolio Budget Measures Statement which includes a range of expenditures not encompassed by the Conroy Report definition (eg. the Senior Executive of the Department, Communications and Public Affairs).</PARA>
