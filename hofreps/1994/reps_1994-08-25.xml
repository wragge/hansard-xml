<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I gather I have seven minutes left to make some further comments on the Employment Services Bill. When I was addressing this matter yesterday, I was making the point&mdash;and I hope strongly&mdash;that we have to ask why the youth training allowance initiative is to be administered through an act of parliament that is under the control of the Department of Employment, Education and Training and why the services will be, in policy terms, run from that department, although the administration is still to be placed in the Department of Social Security. There has been no substantial explanation, either in the white paper or from the government in introducing this legislation, as to why we are taking that route.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This dual administrative regime can occasion difficulties in relation to other legislation. If we look at the area of child support, we find that there is legislation covering the Department of Social Security for family payments and the like. We had a situation where the government moved to provide child-care support through Medicare and through separate departmental arrangements. The administration of child support, following a divorce, is administered through the tax office. We have a situation of enormous complexity and difficulty, with different departments developing different criteria to determine income testing, assets testing, and eligibility criteria. The government is now saying that we have to simplify this administrative regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regarding the payment of income support to young people who happen to be unemployed, the regime is to be hived off and administered separately under legislation and policy guidelines developed through the Department of Employment, Education and Training. All I am saying is that there should be a comprehensive, detailed explanation as to why we need to fragment administration in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point has been made very strongly&mdash;I am sure the government has had a copy of this paper; I will not be able to go through it at length&mdash;in an article produced by the Welfare Rights Centre. It simply asks why the new youth training allowance should come under the Social Security Act and not be transferred to DEET legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The centre makes a point about the jobsearch allowance being replaced by the youth training allowance. In relation to that vexed issue of young homeless people, there are three proposed sets of guidelines under which a young person might be defined and determined as being homeless. That can occur under the social security regime. It can also occur under the Austudy payments for homeless students. Now we have a new and separate set of guidelines proposed for the youth training allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that this matter is to be examined by the Standing Committee on Community Affairs, but what good sense is there in reorganising the training arrangements to come up with three separate and different criteria definitions for determining a homeless young person. I can take honourable members through the question of appropriateness. I think every member of parliament would be aware of the experiences young people have had with the Department of Employment, Education and Training in relation to the income support arrangements for which it is now responsible. I am sure people would know that that department is responsible for the Austudy programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate office, I have greater difficulties in explaining the rigidity in the arrangements by which Austudy is administered, the appeal procedures and the interminable delay because of the way in which payments are arranged at the beginning of the student's year. The complaints abound. The hardships that people endure are well known. Why is it that we would put these matters in the hands of those who now raise these issues when we have a situation where a department is uniquely responsible for the payment of income support?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this paper the Welfare Rights Centre raises a number of issues, such as why it is inappropriate for the youth training allowance to be the responsibility of DEET. It also raises a number of issues of an administrative character. It mentions the role of the CES, which is already involved in part in jobsearch arrangements and accesses those matters in the database of the Department of Social Security. It has been able to work cooperatively in that way in the past, and the centre asks why there is a need to go down that new route. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The centre raises questions about increased administrative complexity, a matter that I raised yesterday. DSS staff who have to administer these payments will have to be familiar with the detail of separate legislation and guidelines contained in another act of parliament. It raises the matter of increased legal complexity and legislative inconsistency. The centre also raises a number of issues relating to review and appeal rights, unfamiliarity with administrative law and the vexed question of future policy making. I think the government has to respond to all of the substantial points made by the Welfare Rights Centre and make it clear that there were, I assume, other substantial reasons for the government proposing this new initiative. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me a great deal of pleasure to rise in the House in support of the Employment Services Bill 1994. This bill gives effect to a series of initiatives contained in the white paper on  employment and growth delivered by the government in May of this year. These measures constitute the broadest set of real reforms to the delivery of Commonwealth labour market programs in our postwar history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These labour market reforms are Labor to the bootstraps. They are reforms that will throw people back into work, not out of it, and will give the long-term unemployed a real chance to participate in the economic recovery. The reforms to labour market assistance that are contained in this legislation are among a raft of initiatives contained in the white paper, which include training and education reforms, the restructuring of the social security system, a regional development strategy, further micro-economic reform and further encouragement to encourage flexibility in workplace agreements. The simple philosophical base that underpins the various labour market initiatives contained in the white paper is succinctly expressed on page 2 of the Working Nation document, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through this White Paper, Australia says to those who are out of work: we believe you are entitled to the benefits of recovery and you have an equal entitlement to contribute to it. If you do not have the right skills to find work, we will help you acquire them. If you are young, we will see that you are educated and trained. If you have been a long time out of work, we will offer you employment and, if necessary, train you for it. We will do all we can to help make you ready for a job.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I guess that last line is a very simple statement, but it encapsulates the basic philosophy that underpins the white paper. Quite simply put: we, the government, will do all we can to help make the unemployed and the long-term unemployed ready for a job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only the Labor Party, in government, has the creative energy and the political will to produce the wide ranging response to unemployment contained in the white paper and the labour market reforms that are encapsulated in this bill that we are debating today. Only the Labor Party, in government, can implement the labour market reforms that are contained in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are very good reasons why this constructive response to unemployment would be beyond the intellectual capacity and the political will of the opposition. I say this for two reasons. The first reason is that the opposition, over the last decade, has sought to blame the unemployed at every opportunity for their situation as if they alone are the architects of their own misfortune. The second reason is quite simple and is contained in the Fightback document itself: part of the opposition's program is to emasculate labour market programs by some $400 million. The simple fact is that the opposition would not be prepared to fund the types of initiatives that are contained in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The labour market reforms contained in the Employment Services Bill 1994 are a necessary response to the way the Australian economy has changed over the past decade. I am not sure whether the Australian population is fully aware of the magnitude of those particular changes. We have seen in the economy the increasing automation and computerisation in the workplace, which has contracted the demand for labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the globalisation of world trade and the consequent internationalisation of the Australian economy has put enormous competitive pressures on the Australian economy to restructure. Those factors, along with the global recession, have contracted work opportunities and have put increased pressure on the work force to acquire new skills and to become more productive. It is in this context that the labour market reforms contained in Working Nation and expressed in the Employment Services Bill 1994 must be viewed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper initiatives, especially the labour market reforms, have been enthusiastically taken up by the Geelong community, whom I represent in this parliament. The white paper itself called for a community response to unemployment, and that is what we are developing in the Geelong region. The call for that community response is contained, once again, on page 2 of the Working Nation document, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reducing unemployment will require more than a commitment from the Commonwealth. All tiers of government must work together. Businesses and unions will have to respond.</PARA>
<PARA>In July, Minister Crean came down to the Corio electorate and gave a commitment of some $20,000 to the organisational effort that was being mounted at the community level in Geelong to address the unemployment problem. A committee was formed prior to his visit consisting of business, local government, community groups, service organisations and unions and the rather dynamic CES that we have in Geelong. I pay tribute to those CES officers, in particular one Tony Stante, who has been the driving force behind the community initiative Jobs Action Geelong 94, which has set a target of some 1,000 jobs to be created over the next 12 months. I am confident that we can achieve those targets in this region of the Commonwealth. I would not be surprised if we blow that target right out of the water. The community has indicated its willingness to put down the old fighting swords of the past and to work together to come to grips with the community problem that we face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Friday morning at a breakfast luncheon at the Geelong football club, Jobs Action Geelong will be launched by Bert Evans of the Metal Trades Industry Association, who I think is on NETTFORCE. It will be a very important occasion for the community. It will be an acid test of the Geelong community's commitment to confront this problem and to overcome it. If that 1,000 jobs target is to be achieved and if all the subsidies being made available by the white paper to encourage this process were to be brought into play, many millions of  dollars will be poured into the Geelong region by the Commonwealth, and I am very proud of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Employment Services Bill we are debating here today has three main objectives. They have been canvassed by the minister in the second reading speech. It establishes the regulatory body for private case management, the Employment Services Regulatory Authority, ESRA. It will also establish Employment Assistance Australia, which will provide government case management services. It will set up the total regulatory framework for the case management system both in the private and the public sector. The Employment Services Regulatory Authority is established under part 4.6 of this bill. Its primary function will be to regulate, monitor and evaluate the case management system on an ongoing basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill represents a radical restructuring of labour market programs and their delivery. It opens up the case management system to competition, which will allow a greater number of the long-term unemployed access to the assistance they need to make them job ready. However, to ensure that the needs of the unemployed are not compromised in any way by the introduction of non-government operators, the Employment Services Regulatory Authority has been established. ESRA will be an independent statutory authority and will be responsible for accrediting and regulating contract case managers. It will also work to promote competition and report back to the minister on the operations of the case management system. ESRA will also monitor the operations of Employment Assistance Australia, which will provide case management services from the Department of Employment, Education and Training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of Employment Assistance Australia ensures that Australia continues to meet its obligations under ILO convention No. 88 to provide a free public employment service. The focus of both ESRA and Employment Assistance Australia will be case management. Case management will give the long-term unemployed one-to-one service. They will negotiate a case management activity agreement which sets a course of action tailored to their individual particular needs. Individuals faced with unemployment will not meet or greet an impersonal bureaucracy any more; they will be given individual attention to help facilitate their entry back into the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similar case management has already begun in Geelong with considerable success. DEET advises me that in the Geelong region there are some 600 people at this time receiving case management assistance. The community has responded well to this program and CES has responded well to the considerable demands that are being placed upon it at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The feedback from those involved in case management has been very positive, with clients expressing appreciation for the extra assistance they are receiving. The end result is that people have already found work in Geelong as a direct result of the implementation of this case management system. The bill will ensure that the case management system will continue to expand to ensure that the long-term unemployed are well placed to benefit from strong economic growth and an expanding job market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the expenditure commitments in One Nation were announced there were many in the opposition and many in the community at large who held the view that all the government was doing was putting the unemployed back on the training roundabout and that there were no jobs for them to go to. There are those who seem to hold the view that any sort of training provided by government labour market programs is intrinsically useless. The simple fact is that these training programs are an important pathway back to employment for unemployed people, especially the long-term unemployed. The simple reality is that jobs are being created at record rates in the economy at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the success or otherwise of training programs, I will share with the House a recent experience which occurred during Minister Crean's visit to Geelong. We opened the building industry group's training facility in north Geelong. It was at that opening that two long-term unemployed youngsters got up and delivered a very moving address. They told of the awful blows to their self-esteem that had resulted from their long-term unemployment. They were taken first into a LEAP scheme which built their confidence and built some basic skills. They then went into a further basic building course that was conducted by the building industry group training scheme. From there they went into an apprenticeship. I understand that both of them are in the second year of their apprenticeships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">BIGS has had a very successful record in placing its apprentices. At the end of their apprenticeships, these two young people can look forward to gaining full-time employment in the building industry in our region. I cite this example because it is a good example of how the training programs provided not only by DEET but also by other areas and programs provide a very important pathway for the long-term unemployed to get back on their feet, to have their self-esteem restored, to acquire new skills and to make their way back into full-time employment. The young people I saw on that occasion were most impressive and I wish them well in their future job seeking endeavours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other side of the equation, there is significant job growth occurring in the Australian economy at this time. In response to a question earlier this week, Minister Crean outlined some of the impressive job creation figures and job growth figures in the Australian economy at this time. Over the past months, some 90,000 jobs have been created in the economy, and since the government came to office some 376,000 jobs have been created. The commitment that the government gave at the last election was that it would set an economic framework that would see the creation of some 500,000 jobs over its three-year term of office. We are well on the way to achieving that target. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point I note that the Commonwealth is not a substantial creator of jobs. The job growth that will flow into the Australian economy will come from the private sector. The Commonwealth government's responsibility is quite simply to set the framework for those enterprises to grow and to create jobs, and we are doing that. The inflation rate is the lowest that it has been for 30 years. Interest rates are the lowest that they have been for 20 years. Our economy is growing at a rate in excess of that of our trading partners. We have seen low levels of industrial disputation and high levels of productivity in strategic sectors of the Australian economy. We have also seen a high degree of profitability returned to enterprises in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not to say that economic tensions will not be created in the economy over time as we move further into the growth phase. But this government has demonstrated quite clearly its capacity to manage these problems and parameters to the advantage of Australian enterprises and the long-term unemployed. It is only when enterprises grow and full-time jobs are created that we will have sustained employment growth, which every economy throughout the Western world so desperately seeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My electorate is very well placed to implement the case management system that is provided for in the bill before the House. We have dedicated private training providers with extensive networks in the industry to which the white paper initiatives and the labour market reforms are well suited. We have community sector training providers who are also very experienced with respect to the case management approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my early days in this parliament, before the white paper was delivered, I can recall a group of jobstart trainees managed by the Brotherhood of St Laurence in Geelong. I was impressed that the Brotherhood of St Laurence recognised that unemployed people doing training courses should not be left abandoned at the end of them. So it put in place post-training support. It was an open-door policy which allowed the trainee to come back into the organisation and utilise the resources of the staff, the capital resources and the networks to further the aims of obtaining employment. It worked very successfully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only our private training providers and community sector training providers who have expertise. In DEET, our own government department, we have very dedicated and committed operatives who are already case managing unemployed people in the Geelong region. In addition, we have large private firms that have the critical mass to provide structured training to the work force. I recently visited Alcoa in Geelong, where year 11 and 12 students are involved in a unique experiment. They are obtaining training from that company. We also have a quality vocational educational training institution, the Gordon Technical College, which has extensive links with industry in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The region that I represent is well placed to take advantage of the resources provided in the white paper. We are well on the way to case managing the long-term unemployed. It is a humane approach. It is one that will increase the skills of the region. It is one that recognises not only the economic imperative but also the social imperative. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 4 May the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) delivered the ALP's much heralded white paper and assured us that it was a classic piece of social practice from the annals of Ben Chifley. I note that the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) concurs with the Prime Minister's assessment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Just 50 years ago, with the white paper on full employment, another Australian Labor government codified and consolidated social policies which together formed the basis of the Australian social welfare system,' the Prime Minister told the parliament. He went on to describe Chifley's white paper as more modest than his own. The Keating white paper, he said, was a program for employment and growth. At the time, most claimed that the white paper embodied an interventionist approach to employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Predictably, the coalition argued that the government was simply throwing money at the problem of unemployment and that what was really needed was serious labour market reform and a reduction in the plethora of oncosts and taxation burdens which the opposition says are impeding business in its quest for efficiency. The then Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), described the white paper as `all about spending, training and politics'. Unfortunately, the honourable member did little more than complain about the imposts on business and whine about the need for a more flexible labour market. It was a speech straight out of the documents the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) would bring into this parliament. It had everything to do with Whitlam and not Chifley, he said, as if by definition this meant it was diseased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a captive of the neoclassical market approach himself, the honourable member could say little to truly distinguish himself from his so-called adversary, the Prime Minister. The irony is that the concessions in the white paper are really concessions to business borne by either the community or individual workers being paid discounted wages. The fact that it does give labour market concessions to business is ignored by the Liberal Party in the interests of accentuating the philosophical gulf which allegedly exists between the two parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Others, essentially those on the Left, conscious of the possibility that a job compact and a training wage might become a means by which employers would depress wages and weaken awards, were left to mount the charge. The reservations, unfortunately, were short lived. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the 1993 election the ALP attacked the coalition's wages policy, which it said amounted to nothing more than slave labour. At the time, speaker after speaker in this House piously condemned the coalition's $3 an hour youth wage and reaffirmed the ALP's commitment to award wages. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), aware as he was that the difference between the ALP's and the coalition's labour market reforms was becoming decidedly unclear, chose to describe the training wage as a transitional wage. The minister exhorted those opposite him to take on board the fact that the ALP policy at least contained a training component. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I well recall the minister reminding the House that the ALP was all about making the unemployed jobs ready&mdash;a sentiment expressed again by the honourable member for Corio. Similar sentiments were expressed by the Prime Minister in his Working Nation ministerial statement when he blithely summarised the great economic changes that Australia was experiencing as it sought international competitiveness and engaged in the challenging task of producing sophisticated services and manufactures&mdash;all that rhetoric we hear every day in the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Hundreds of thousands of Australians through no fault of their own are bearing the burden of that change,' the Prime Minister said. Of course, he was not apologising for these so-called economic reforms; no, these were the tough decisions that had to be made: the tough decisions we would expect a good, decent, Labor Prime Minister to the bootstraps to make; the medicine that had to be taken. Those policies, including tariff cuts, were making us more competitive in the world economy, he told us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the tariff cuts wrecked the economy of the former Prime Minister's seat of Wills and displaced a huge swag of the work force I suppose is simply the kind of sacrifice the Labor party mandarins expect from their supporters. The honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) knows full well what is required of the faithful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite all the euphemisms, the real message in the white paper is that it is not the market or the social arrangement of production which is the problem but the unemployed. Citing evidence that the long-term unemployed are predominantly unskilled and using positivist methodology, the bureaucrats arrive at the conclusion that unemployment is a product of a lack of skill. Armed with the faulty premise that lack of skill and unemployment are one and the same, we move blithely to the conclusion that all we need to do is train those who are unemployed and maintain growth of more than four per cent and unemployment will disappear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Funny, though, is it not, that no-one is prepared to stake his or her political credibility on being able to predict when we will have full employment again. I would have thought that, if economics is the science some know-alls in the media would have us believe, such predictions could be made with certainty. I note that from the Labor side the honourable members for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), Lilley (Mr Swan) and Gilmore (Mr Knott) will be speaking today. Maybe one of them will make a prediction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Gilmore, a member of the Left, might like to give us an insight into how the Left views the proposition that unemployment can be solved by case management and wage cuts. Maybe the duty senator for Wills could forgo number crunching for a few weeks and concentrate on the serious social-political issues. He has been up to his armpits in the Lalor episode. He spends more time on that than on thinking about serious economic policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ALP prefers to take a circuitous route and crow about how many new jobs have been created. The honourable member for Lilley joined the chorus only yesterday, telling us that Australia was now 30 per cent more competitive than a decade ago and was experiencing record rates of economic growth and record job growth. After all that, I wondered why we needed a white paper. Unfortunately, it was not in his political interests to talk about the casualisation of employment or the possible effect of the job compact and training wage on award wages. Then again, he is not on his own. Given that the coalition actually believes lower wages will improve the economy and most in the ALP believe it will improve their electoral prospects by hiding unemployment, we can understand why. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is remarkable is that the union movement has been so quiet on the matter. It is understood that many on the Left and at least some within the union are aware that some measures outlined in the white paper are really intended to facilitate the more efficient operation of the market rather than create jobs. In essence, those who have effectively been outside the labour market will now, by virtue of a discounted training wage, enter the market and depress the price of labour within that market. As a consequence, wages will find what the classical economists term their real market value. The Prime Minister acknowledged in his ministerial statement that the markets do not always get it right. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government sees its proper role as creating a competitive environment for industry and, by strategic intervention, helping to create competitive companies. As the paper says, our policy must be to harness the power of the markets, while recognising that markets will not always give us the best possible results.</PARA>
<PARA>That is why he gets a bit angry at those people who work on the Stock Exchange&mdash;the ones with the mobile phones and the Porsches. In reality, everything the Prime Minister says and everything in the white paper confirms the government's commitment to the market and the virtues of competition. This is a Prime Minister who is besotted by the market. When the euphemisms, the platitudes and the political speak are stripped away, we are left wondering what really separates the ALP and the coalition on matters philosophical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) went into raptures about the job compact and the white paper. The fact that around the Prime Minister's seat the official general unemployment rate is 14 per cent and youth unemployment is 18 per cent obviously does not bother her. There are places around Australia which have worse figures than those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I presume case management will solve this problem. Of course, people need to be trained and prepared for work, but the argument that those in the unemployment queues are there because they lack the appropriate skills has dangerous connotations for the working people the ALP claims to care about. Furthermore, if the economists and market analysts can be so precise in their analysis of why it is that some people are unemployed for long periods of time, why can they not identify the specific jobs for which people should be trained?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I doubt there is an honourable member in the parliament who has not heard unemployed people bemoan the fact that they just do not know what kind of training they should be doing. The Prime Minister can crow about strategic intervention and our new competitive culture, and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training can chime in with platitudes about job readiness, but if we ask about new industries we will receive a vague geography lesson about Asia, and hear about the export dollars being earned from tourism and the latest Australian film. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Minister for Communications and the Arts and the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) gets a dorothy dixer about the Australian film industry, he gets so excited that his eyes light up, and he speaks the language of an economic nationalist. Unfortunately, as Kenneth Davidson argued in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on 16 July 1994, economic nationalism plays second fiddle to the phoney nationalism that dominates the debate over the republic. Honest economic nationalists would not let the production of ideas and the production of things fall into the hands of foreign ownership. Mr Davidson asks:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From a national point of view, why is it so important for Mr Keating to cut symbolic links with the Crown and, at the same time, facilitate foreign control of the Australian media?</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Perth might be able to give us a clue as to the likely answer to that question. I will leave that question for those on the Labor side to take up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ironically, it is the French, whom our Prime Minister loves and worships, who understand what economic nationalism actually means. Much to the chagrin of the Prime Minister, they at least try to practise it. If the French were forced to kowtow to the Prime Minister's form of economics, he might find Paris a little less desirable as a destination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Working people have made great sacrifices under the accord, and so-called economic restructuring has taken its toll. Yet the government continues to place its faith in the market and the principles of competition. As the honourable member for Lilley so succinctly pointed out yesterday in his defence of ANL:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What angers me so much as I sit in this House and listen to so much of the supercilious comment that comes from those opposite is that they never acknowledge that the work force in this country has already made substantial sacrifices.</PARA>
<PARA>Interestingly, the honourable member for Lilley was having a bit each way on the privatisation issue. He did not really say where he stood on privatisation. But that was not the case with the job compact. I think he is on record as saying that it will be partly funded by privatisation. Take Melbourne airport. That is great for Victoria and good for the New South Wales Right!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be interested to hear how he responds to the argument that the job compact and the training wage are a couple of levers by which the government can bring about greater competitiveness in the labour market. Mr Steve Burrell, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 5 May 1994, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But allowing employers to pay sub-award wages while providing training on the job means a lower entry level hourly wage, making the long term unemployed and young people with no experience more attractive. The success of the idea will thus swing on how much the ACTU is prepared to turn a blind eye to the training wage being used as an ersatz form of labour market deregulation.</PARA>
<PARA>However, the Prime Minister says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nor do we accept that the only way to maintain our standard of living is to lower the wages of Australian workers.</PARA>
<PARA>According to Mr Burrell, the job compact and the training wage are `a recognition that present award minimum wages are set too high to allow the long-term unemployed to get a job'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those with a more jaundiced view of the white paper are worried that it might amount to unemployment queue shuffling. What is politically disturbing about the white paper is that it says nothing about redistribution of wealth or the capacity of increased taxation at the top end to fund government expenditure. Rather than opting for the imagery and language of social democracy and old style Labor, the white paper is infested with the language and logic of the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the white paper amounting to a big spending Whitlamesque document, as claimed by the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), that is really a furphy. On 7 May, the economics editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, Tim Colebatch, pointed out that, contrary to claims that the government was spending an extra $4.8 billion on employment and training, the real figure was only $1.35 billion. The largest single element of these labour market reforms is the job compact, with its case management for the long-term unemployed. The government has made great play of the fact that it is adopting a hands-on approach to the problem of long-term unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Case management, however, cannot overcome the dislocation created by regional economic disparity. Telling people in Wills, for example, that their job prospects would be better in Toorak Road or in a sweat shop in Fiji will not solve the problem. Many unemployed workers I speak with say they want the government to create jobs, not case managers. One bloke told me that case management was an insult and was based on the assumption that there was something odd or unusual about him. While it is true that the government's approach to unemployment is not as extreme as that of the captives of the market to my right, that does not mean that the white paper should not be criticised or that it is everything the myth makers claim it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are plenty of people prepared to describe the white paper as a product of neoliberalism or neoclassical economics. Unfortunately, those people either do not sit in this place or are forced to shut up. In a paper to be released in October, Iain Campbell from Melbourne University captures the irony of the situation when he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures are consonant with the recent efforts towards a deregulation of the labour market aimed at downward wage flexibility and an enhancement of management prerogative. Far from representing assistance for the disadvantaged, the central initiatives of the White Paper are more accurately viewed as a contribution to the deregulation of the labour market, in this case through the back door.</PARA>
<PARA>The paper was delivered at a conference in Strasbourg. Apart from questioning the philosophical imperatives of the government's approach in the white paper, Mr Campbell questions the nature of training arrangements. He argues that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both the quality and the extent of training under the training wage arrangements are open to serious question. The definition of training has been watered down in the negotiations leading to the draft award, and is now simply described as `formal instruction both theoretical and practical and supervised practice'. This notion of supervised practice is remarkably vague and seems largely indistinguishable from ordinary labour within the terms of a conventional employment relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those on the Left who refrain from considered criticism of the white paper and those in the party who continue to claim that its wages policy is qualitatively different from the coalition's should have a good hard look at themselves. The Prime Minister's claim that `the white paper is underpinned by the belief that Australia must and can be a high wage and high productivity country' warrants critical assessment. Iain Campbell has no doubts as to the philosophy underpinning the white paper. He argues that it is more about assistance to employers than about productivity and high wages. He puts it this way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where wage subsidies and the training wage are joined together the cost of assistance is shared between the public and the individual in question. From this perspective the new measures are in the first place a form of industry assistance to selected employers.</PARA>
<PARA>What is ironic about this form of assistance is that it comes from a government which derides tariff assistance as a slothful way of conducting economic business and an impost on workers, consumers and so-called efficient manufacturers. Furthermore, as a form of intervention designed to make the market operate more efficiently, it contradicts the much vaunted proposition espoused by Hilmer, et al, that only via pure competition can we achieve the best economic outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of more immediate practical importance is the question of whether the initiatives in the white paper will actually create jobs or, as Campbell suggests, `substitute targeted for untargeted persons'. Rather than drawing the long-term unemployed into real long-term work, there remains the very real possibility that we will simply have more people with the appropriate qualifications jostling for the one job. As any number of critical commentators have noted, the initiatives open the way for the undercutting of award wages and the establishment of low wage regimes which run counter to the ALP's rhetoric about Australia's future as a high wage, high productivity country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of the recent trends in enterprise bargaining and the government's support for non-union enterprise agreements, the white paper leaves the union movement with plenty to think about. What is intriguing is that the trade union movement has been generally silent on the question of the potential dangers of the initiatives in the white paper. To ignore the potential for across-the-board wage reductions and the casualisation of labour contained in the job compact and the training wage is absolute folly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I support the sentiments of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), to support the amendment would be to imply that the coalition has a policy to address unemployment. The truth is that the coalition's approach is nothing more than an extreme version of the Labor Party's policy. The sad reality is that it is the Liberal Party's extremism which enables the Labor Party to survive with policies which have nothing to do with Chifley and Curtin but plenty to do with free market philosophy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">I rise to support the Employment Services Bill now before the House. This bill implements some of the measures contained in the Working Nation white paper. The Working Nation white paper had as its philosophical base the notion that, as economic recovery occurs and long-term unemployed people are to be picked up as part of that recovery, we need to take additional steps and special measures to ensure that that occurs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of us on this side give a shorthand phrase to that notion&mdash;growth plus. That means we need to ensure that we maximise economic growth but we also need to take additional measures to ensure that long-term unemployed people are picked up. Many in this chamber would be aware of the experience of the 1980s, when over 1.6 million jobs were created but only about 110,000 of those jobs went to long-term unemployed people. The particular measures that this bill implements relate to the job compact and go to individual case management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make some comments about growth and maximising growth, and look at the path we are on to a sustainable recovery, which will provide long-term, secure, stable jobs for Australian working people. It is important to look at the current set of economic parameters to see where we are at this point in the cycle. On a number of occasions recently, the Treasurer (Mr Willis) has made the point that we are looking at the best configuration of economic fundamentals in over 30 years, and that is unquestionably the case. Those opposite will deride that and others who do not necessarily sit on that side but sit on the crossbenches, such as the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary), will seek to avoid it, but it is the truth and is fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those fundamentals include economic growth, low inflation, low inflationary expectations, continuing low interest rates, high business confidence, high consumer confidence, massively increased productivity, increases in real wages, increases in disposal household incomes, near record profit shares, massive improvements in international competitiveness, the lowest industrial disputation since the 1930s, the government on a firm deficit reduction strategy and massive  increases in exports, particularly in the manufacturing and services area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at some details of those. The budget deficit reduction program sees us firmly on a task to have a deficit of less than one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. We are 30 per cent more competitive internationally than we were a decade ago and we are now sitting on a forecast of economic growth of or above four per cent. Economic growth in the year to March was five per cent. We are sitting on the lowest inflation rate we have seen for many years, which is about 1.7 per cent. The trend line for inflation continues to go downward from 2.1 per cent to 1.9 per cent. Inflation has been under 2 1/2 per cent for about three years and we have a much lower inflation rate than the vast bulk of our trading partners. Low inflationary expectations continue to be part of the growing culture of the Australian community, particularly the business and investment community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Exports of elaborately transformed manufactures have increased by 17 per cent a year since 1988. Our exports are massively increasing and diversifying, and that is particularly the case with manufacturing and services. Services exports have increased by about nine per cent per annum and now make up about 20 per cent of our exports. So the old roller-coaster of total reliance on commodity prices is now slowly but steadily being reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last 12 months, real wages have increased by 2 1/2 per cent and that has effectively been the average for the last couple of years. In 1994-95 wages are forecast to increase by 1 1/4 per cent. We have seen approved the $8 increase for wage and salary earners who are involved in enterprise bargaining, and the accord arrangement will see two further $8 increases proceed on the basis of the fundamental accord relationship between the government and the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Household disposal incomes are increasing. They have increased by 0.75 per cent in 1994, and the forecast is an increase of 0.75 per cent by 1995. Some of that comes from the tax cuts which came into effect in November last year. Industrial disputation in this country is the lowest it has been for 60 years and, if the industrial disputation caused by the activities of Premier Kennett in Victoria were taken away, it would probably scupper to below the traces on the scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the highest level of business confidence that we have seen in this country for 30 years, and consumer confidence is currently at the highest recorded level since consumer confidence figures were taken. These are the basic economic parameters that we have, and they are the economic parameters and the economic fundamentals that those on the other side never want to hear about. When they do hear about them, they hate it, because they know that at the last election they missed their chance of victory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now seeing the effects and the benefit of the economic programs that this government brought into play, from the programs outlined in One Nation through to Investing in the Nation and now the programs outlined in Working Nation. It is important to pay some attention not just to those economic parameters and fundamentals but also to recent employment statistics. The last set of employment figures was released on 11 August. It is worth while going through some of those figures. I will also make some references to comments made by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) on that day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unquestionably the case&mdash;everyone on this side certainly accepts it and has it as a fundamental starting point&mdash;that unemployment remains unacceptably high. It is our most pressing social and economic problem and we need to ensure that all of our energy is devoted to reducing it. We on this side of the chamber, through Working Nation, have a commitment to get the rate of unemployment down to at least five per cent by the end of the decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest ABS figures show a growth of 90,000 in employment in the last recorded month. Over 376,000 jobs have been created since the election in March 1993. As the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) often points out, that is 75 per cent of the target of 500,000 new jobs which the government set itself in the course of the election campaign; it is 75 per cent of the target in 40 per cent of the time. That has occurred at a time when the participation rate has increased. So from the election period the rate of unemployment has gone down from about 11.2 per cent to 9 1/2 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own state of Western Australia, the figures are particularly encouraging. That has nothing to do with Premier Court but everything to do with the policies that this government has adopted over the last couple of years and in the preceding decade. The great moves to ensure that Australia became an internationally competitive country, the bringing down of the tariff barriers, the floating of the dollar, the need to ensure that we adopted best practice to be internationally competitive&mdash;all these things have massively improved the prospects and the benefits that go to my state of Western Australia, as well as to the state of Queensland, currently represented by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay), who is sitting at the table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia the unemployment rate is now down to 8.1 per cent, and that is despite the fact that the participation rate in Western Australia is consistently two, three or four points above the average participation rate for the rest of the country. We sit on a participation rate of 65 to 66 per cent. If we had the participation rate of other states, on a rule of thumb calculation that figure would be reduced from eight per cent to about five or six per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures in the bill before the House contain special steps to ensure that long-term unemployed people are picked up as part of the economic recovery. I made the point earlier that in the course of the massive job growth that this government presided over in the mid-1980s&mdash;from 1983 to 1989&mdash;1.6 million jobs were created but only 110,000 of those jobs went to long-term unemployed people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the ABS labour force figures for Australia come out at the end of this month, we will see that long-term unemployment has declined to about 290,000. That is a 14,000 drop over the previous month, and it is a 76,000 drop since the election. Over the 15- to 18-month period since March 1993, we have seen a 76,000 drop in the number of long-term unemployed. There were effectively 1.6 million jobs created from 1983 to 1989 and, of that 1.6 million, 110,000 jobs went to the long-term unemployed. Of the 376,000 jobs that have been created since the election, about 76,000 have gone to the long-term unemployed. That is a result of the targeted labour market programs that were adopted in advance of the Working Nation statement. When the effect of case management, the training wage and the job compact come into play, we are confident that we will see a very effective attack on the remaining 290,000 long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite do not like to hear these statistics. When they hear them, they deride them. The statistics show that we are on track for a sustainable economic recovery. In our view employment growth will be sustainable, the unemployment rate will steadily drop and, as a result of the economic recovery and the special measures taken in the Working Nation statement, the long-term unemployed pool will reduce substantially. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More Australians are now in work than ever before, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Simon Crean, said today. Employment in July grew to a record 7.97 million jobs, 62,000 above the previous peak in July 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>We currently have more people employed in this country than ever before. The minister makes various points in that press release, many of which I have taken up. I have drawn attention to the contrasts in the unemployment figures of the various states. The press release further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All mainland States shared in the jobs growth, with the unemployment rate falling from 10 per cent to 9.5 per cent in New South Wales, 10.7 per cent to 10.2 per cent in Victoria, 9.3 per cent to 9 per cent in Queensland, 11.2 per cent to 10.4 per cent in South Australia and 8.9 per cent to 8.1 per cent in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>That range of economic parameters and employment statistics shows that we are on track for a sustainable economic recovery which will see jobs growth and unemployment falling. Part of the attempt to maximise economic growth and to ensure that all steps are  taken to maximise sustainable economic recovery includes the massive incentives for business investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1994-95 financial year, incentives to business investment are of the order of $3 billion. The range of measures to achieve that investment includes accelerated depreciation, introduced in the One Nation statement in 1992; the development allowance for large projects and the more general investment allowance; the 150 per cent research and development expenditure write-off, which is now a permanent feature of our tax system; and the general reduction in the corporate rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent, which was an election commitment and brought in last year. I take great pleasure in constantly reminding those opposite that, at precisely the time we went to the community with a commitment to reduce the company tax rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent, they had a commitment to increase it from 39 per cent to 45 per cent, plus whack the business community and the Australian community with a 15 per cent GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to those incentives to investment, I draw the attention of the House to some of the other key initiatives found in the Working Nation statement designed to maximise growth and to ensure that industry in Australia performs to a maximum extent. Page 54, in a summary version, under the heading `Key industry policy initiatives', lists:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. better access for smaller firms to research and development incentives</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill sees the introduction of the case management program and the job compact. What attitude do those opposite take to assisting the unemployed and the long-term unemployed? At the last election they had the following measures contained in their Fightback package: tip people off the dole after nine months; slash a minimum of $800 million off outlays to labour market programs and the unemployed; and, under the false and misleading guise of a so-called training wage, slash wages of young people and ordinary Australian workers. That is what those opposite stood for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When investment in our community and in infrastructure was needed, we introduced the One Nation statement and, subsequently, the Working Nation statement, which provided an investment in training and industry. On both occasions those opposite said, `We will not spend any money for these purposes.' Their approach was to tip people off the dole after nine months; slash outlays to ensure there was no investment in the community, industry or infrastructure; and&mdash;their catch-all policy for every perceived ill in society&mdash;slash the wages of ordinary Australian working people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the House take a very different approach and have a very different attitude. We need to maximise economic growth, and part of that involves expenditure. We need to ensure there are investment incentives for business, but at the same time special steps need to be taken to ensure that long-term unemployed people are picked up as part of the recovery. The array of measures found in the Working Nation statement goes from business and industry incentives to the job compact and case management arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the array of measures in the bill includes the establishment of the National Employment and Training Taskforce; the introduction of the job compact; the establishment of case management for the CES and for private competition; and the establishment of the Employment Service Regulatory Authority, ESRA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before the House is strongly supported by those on this side of the chamber because it falls into our philosophical commitment that unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, is our most pressing social and economic problem.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That stands in stark contrast to those opposite, whose attitude is: if people are unemployed, it is their fault. They would tip them off the dole and not spend any money to try to help them.

We believe that Australia can become a high economic growth, high employment, low inflation, high wage, high productivity, high exporting country. When we achieve that&mdash;and we are well on the way&mdash;we will see long-term, secure high wage jobs for Australians in a low inflationary, high economic growth culture.

It is not a wealthy city. It is full of people who live in weatherboard houses. In the 1981 census the average household income in Box Hill was $36,000 in 1991 dollars. In 1991 the average household income was $33,000. That cannot be explained by changes in demography. It cannot be explained by unemployment, because the unemployment was the same in Box Hill on both occasions. So 10 years of Labor has reduced the average household income in Box Hill, a battling, working area, by 10 per cent. That is not something of which I would be particularly proud. </PARA>

He said, `You have one of the oldest car fleets in the world, unlike any other first world country. I am quite familiar with this problem.

To suggest, as the honourable member for Perth did, that we should tip people off the dole after nine months, slash wages of young people and slash outlays so there would be no investment in infrastructure is really extraordinarily disingenuous, particularly as this very bill has the capacity to tip people off unemployment benefits completely, particularly as real wages have declined over the last decade under Labor, particularly as the Reserve Bank said yesterday that Labor needed to rein in outlays if it wanted to prevent higher interest rates, and particularly when the missing ingredient of this recovery is business investment. </PARA>

Coming out of this recession business investment is flatter; if anything, it is down. We have not seen anything like the 14 1/2 per cent promised by the government in the budget. For that reason, this is not going to be a long-lasting recovery. For that reason, I think Labor is in more trouble than it cares to believe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the honourable member for Perth. Long-term unemployment is the greatest social problem Australia faces, and any members of parliament whose constituents come through their office and tell them of personal tragedies that unemployment is wreaking upon them and their families cannot help but be moved. Let us remember who created long-term unemployment. Let us remember that this is not a universal problem. Many, but not all, countries are facing it. Let us remember that things could have been done a long time before now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the most cynical thing is that Labor will not talk about the way it is hiding the long-term unemployed. The mature allowance has tipped 25,000 older people off the unemployment figures. Rather than address the problem of long-term unemployment, the government says, `If you are over 60 and have been unemployed for 12 months, forget it. You are never going to find a job. We will put you on something until you can get the pension.' So these wonderful figures that are quoted about the drop in long-term unemployment do not ever tell us that a large part of the drop is made up of people between 60 and 65 years of age who have gone on to the mature allowance and are no longer required to look for work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is not what I came here to talk about. As the shadow minister for employment at the time of the green and white papers, I have taken a keen interest in employment issues. Being the shadow minister for community services and having responsibility for disability issues, I have a special interest in the labour market experiences of people with disabilities. I also share the belief with my colleague the shadow minister for employment, training and family services, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), that this bill represents a pain-killer rather than a solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line for unemployed Australians, not the least those with a disability, is strong and sustained job growth in a confident economic climate. It has nothing to do with the bill. Therefore, I support the amendment from the honourable member for Goldstein. I can see that growth alone will not solve the problems of the unemployed, nor will an environment where business is having a strike in investment and nor will an environment where the government does not have the guts to be honest with itself about the real magnitude of unemployment and therefore hides it in things like mature allowances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is a means by which the government will establish its much touted case management structure and the Employment Services Regulatory Authority which will oversee that process. The government must be confident of the outcome since it advertised in the national press last weekend for a chief executive officer for the Employment Services Regulatory Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to focus today on the question of case management from the perspective of many unemployed people who have some form of disability&mdash;people that the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) claimed earlier in this debate are in Labor's debt. I am not sure all of them would see it quite that way. I question the benefits this bill will have for people with disabilities but, before I do, let me outline the size of the problem or, more correctly, the size of the challenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this end I will quote figures that the government used in its white paper on unemployment in May. In December 1993 around 168,000 people with some form of disability were registered as unemployed. Slightly more than half the people, over 80,000, were, by then, unemployed for 18 months or more. The earlier green paper, referring to CES data, said that 61 per cent of people with disabilities were unemployed for more than 12 months in October 1993 compared with 47 per cent of all people unemployed. The definitional threshold for long-term unemployment is 12 months, and it is the separation point between jobsearch and newstart benefits. Seventy-three per cent of this group with disabilities were on jobsearch or newstart allowances. I think it would be safe to assume that two-thirds were actually on newstart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to remind the House that those with a disability form a very diverse group of people. The recent Bureau of Statistics survey `Disability, Ageing and Carers' gives us a good snapshot of the population with a disability and shows that it is far from a homogeneous group of people. There are people with physical disabilities; there are people with mental disabilities; and there are people with a combination of physical and mental disabilities. Similarly, disabilities range from mild to the profound. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bureau of Statistics found that labour force participation tended to fall the higher the level of disability but, even so, the participation rate of people with severe disabilities was still almost 40 per cent. In other words, while employment problems of people with disabilities are serious and need to be addressed by the whole Australian community, it is impossible to say that a standard approach will achieve far-reaching results for such a disparate group of individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very fact that the proportion of Commonwealth Employment Service registrants with a disability who were long-term unemployed or very long-term unemployed last December is eloquent evidence that those with a disability have particular difficulties in obtaining employment. I recognise that much has been done in recent years by both state and federal governments to improve life opportunities of people with disabilities. Even more importantly, I welcome the recent cooperation between employers and the trade union movement to support productivity based entry level wage structures to make Australians with a disability more competitive in the labour market. So where is the government going in assisting unemployed people who are disabled? It is going further down the path of case management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper on unemployment staked the success of its entire multibillion dollar package of job compact measures on the foundation of a case management approach to assisting individual long-term unemployed people and other special groups, such as people with disabilities. The Employment Services Bill is to provide the legislative framework, chapter 4 setting out the case management system, particularly the operation of the case management process and the regulatory framework. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not oppose the general direction of this bill, and I endorse the trend to more focused assistance for individual unemployed people. In general, I have reservations about the type of case management structure which the government will set in place in this bill, particularly for people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at the case management services being provided. Case management will offer the unemployed a more one on one type of assistance, including arranging access to labour market programs and subsidised employment. The relationship will be underpinned by case management activity agreements setting up the rights and obligations of the client and the case manager. Clauses 31 to 38 of the bill cover the operation of the activity agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to clause 32(1), I note that the types of activities which can be required of the clients include jobsearch, measures designed to eliminate or reduce any disadvantage the person may have in the labour market, and participation in a rehabilitation program. Clearly, conditions such as these are of direct importance to the relationship between clients with disabilities and their case managers. It will require great understanding and sensitivity on the part of the individual case managers to apply these conditions effectively in every instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will also be important that procedural guidelines introduced by DEET to apply to conditions in clause 32(1) are sufficiently flexible and informative to clarify the sweeping terms of that clause. Presumably these guidelines will build on the experience of newstart activity agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Case management assistance will be offered under the auspices of a new CES subsidiary, Employment Assistance Australia. In the early years, about 90 per cent of case management services will be provided by public servants in the CES and the remainder will be devolved to voluntary or private sector entities. I will return to the non-government provider later. First I want to comment on the CES in-house services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CES case managers will not necessarily be, as far as I can see, people with broad experience in assisting the unemployed at an intensive level, who will be few and far between. When dealing with all long-term and disadvantaged unemployed people, including those with disabilities, the CES case manager will need to have the training and acquired experience to give a client the fairest possible go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last May I asked the then Minister for Employment, Education and Training a question on notice seeking information about the numbers and the Public Service levels of CES case managers to be employed by DEET. I was advised by him that there will be about 3,000 case managers in place when the job compact is fully operational. The classification of present and intended case managers will be at the administrative service officer levels 3 and 4. Even allowing for many of these officers having prior CES client assistance experience, they are relatively junior officers in Public Service terms, subject to the guidance and direction of their seniors. It will also be hard to recruit trained or otherwise suitable persons from outside at such relatively low salary levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect of this service not provided for in the bill is the extent of the support case managers will be able to give their clients. In respect of clients with a disability, however, page 139 of the policies and programs statement accompanying the white paper indicates that only case managers for this group will have lower case loads and higher expenditure available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the question on notice outlined above, this load appears to be about 125 clients per year, or about 1 1/2 working days per client per year. This 1 1/2 days includes one-on-one discussions between client and case officer, preparing the activity agreement, arranging program placements and follow-up and all the associated paperwork. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise this now to highlight that the spirit of the government legislation, which the coalition does not oppose, may well be frustrated by the resources available to assist people with disabilities. As I said earlier, the group of people with disabilities is diverse, not only in the range and severity of disabilities but also in the complexity of its needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of case management of those with a disability, and particularly those with more complex and severe disabilities, we have the benefit of experience to raise such questions. I refer to the case managed employment assistance provided to clients with a disability by the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service since late 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth rehabilitation case management experience was cited favourably by the committee for employment opportunities as a successful model. This is something I do not dispute. I understand that about one in two of the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service's employment assistance clients find employment and most of the rest are participating in employment access programs run by DEET and other agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this success has come at considerable cost. The green paper committee itself stated that the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service model is expensive and intensive. Yet intensity is crucial to the success of assisting those with a disability. This view is supported by no less an authority than the recently retired Secretary to the Department of Human Services and Health, Mr Tony Cole. In a letter dated 24 January 1994 provided to Senator Tambling following a Senate estimates committee hearing, Mr Cole wrote to the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Dr Michael Keating. He said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People with a disability will continue to represent a significant element of the long-term unemployed, and will need assistance of the kind and intensity made available by the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service. The green paper's suggestion to use a less intensive modified version of case-management is unlikely to be effective for these clients. People with a disability will continue to require professional support to provide service to overcome the handicap of their disability plus the increased support necessary to deal with the effects of long-term detachment from the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the rub for the government and for the case management system set out in the bill. We all want to maximise the  opportunities for those Australians who may have a disability to make a full contribution to the economic life of this nation, but the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service experience indicates that to do this requires an intense effort in time and resources, something that the bill we are discussing does not recognise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other part of the bill I would like to consider here relates to the contracting out of case management services. Clause 44 provides that the board of the Employment Services Regulatory Authority may make determinations to specify special classes of case management services and enable accreditation of contracted case managers as specialists, generalists or both. The explanatory memorandum indicates that specialisation will be allowed in relation to case management services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As shadow minister for disability matters, I support this provision of the bill. Indeed, I believe that for groups of particularly disadvantaged people, such as people with disabilities, this clause may well be the most important clause in the bill. It is important because it will allow the involvement in the case management process of agencies and individuals with good track records and the accompanying expertise to provide assistance to Australians with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Non-government entities contracted under this bill will be able to provide clients with disabilities a specialist service involving disability professionals. No matter how well intentioned and committed generalist Public Service case managers may be, they will not be able, as I have already observed, to provide people with disabilities with the level of intense assistance they may need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), said in his second reading speech that government and non-government case managers will learn by doing. This may well be true, but non-government organisations with a strong base of expertise will be better placed than the CES to achieve the objectives of this bill. Personally I would like see the numbers of clients assisted by non-government case managers as high as possible, certainly well beyond the 10 per cent figure quoted in the white paper and the budget. Even the 40 per cent market share for 1996-97 forecast by the minister should be indicative rather than absolute. Having said that, I also hope that the CES, in training its own case managers, draws on the expertise of organisations that help and represent people with a disability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Employment Services Bill is the embodiment of the government's white paper and its job compact. I wish the case management approach well and would not begrudge it if it is shown to make a significant difference to the plight of the long-term unemployed. But I also believe that, once adopted, such an approach needs to be able to meet the needs of all its clients and particularly those with especially strong labour market disadvantages. In the case of Australians with disabilities I am not assured that the case management model proposed in this bill will meet the needs of this special client group. It is one thing to commit billions of dollars to assist the unemployed through the white paper; it is another to spend that money for the maximum benefit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my pleasure to support the Employment Services Bill in the House today. Although the white paper has been debated widely in this House and in the community, it is difficult for many to realise the vast scope of the white paper. That is particularly the case when it comes to the comments from those opposite. The white paper is a back-to-work package. It is probably the most comprehensive plan dealing with employment issues ever put forward in this country. It gives equal emphasis to pursuing export led growth strategies for long-term job creation in the private sector while alleviating long-term unemployment through the job compact. I guess at the heart of the white paper is a profound philosophical difference between those on this side of the House and those opposite. The central aim of the white paper is not only to make Australia a more prosperous society; it is also the aim to make us a much fairer society by ensuring a fairer distribution of jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper, otherwise known as Working Nation, is simply designed to ensure that the long-term unemployed share in the economic recovery and that they are not left behind as the rest of the Australian community receives the very profound benefits now flowing from the very strong levels of economic growth. I reject the criticism of those opposite that somehow the white paper is just about labour market programs. Labour market programs are very important and that fact is never acknowledged by the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition never acknowledges that at the heart of the white paper is the government's commitment to a strategy of growth-plus. We agree with the opposition that long-term jobs will be created only in the private sector and we need to get very strong levels of investment and growth throughout the rest of this decade so that we can create not only more jobs but also jobs with career prospects&mdash;highly paid jobs rather than lowly paid jobs; highly productive jobs rather than lowly productive jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an enormous amount of discussion in the white paper about the economic strategy to promote growth. We have to ensure that this country is internationally competitive so we can export more and import less. We must ensure that we create jobs in the private sector and that we export more and add value to what we produce. All of those aims are at the core of the white paper. But as everybody in this parliament should know, growth alone is not enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition fails to acknowledge what we should do when growth will not provide jobs for the long-term unemployed. The good thing about the white paper is that it buries the view that growth alone is enough. Growth alone is clearly not enough. That is why, without the measures outlined in this bill relating to the job compact, we will continue to have high levels of long-term unemployment for the rest of the century. At the heart of the white paper is a moral and philosophical stance that no nation, as a matter of public choice, should tolerate the development of a permanent underclass created through intergenerational long-term unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast to those opposite, we on this side of the House say that there needs to be a very specific set of government programs which intervene to break the cycle of long-term unemployment for the long-term unemployed. We know that they will not automatically be the beneficiaries of growth. It is a fact that the longer people are unemployed the more likely they are to be unemployed for longer periods. Employers simply use length of unemployment as a proxy for deciding that someone who is long-term unemployed is in fact unemployable. Similarly, the longer people are unemployed, the more they become demoralised, the more they lose contact with the world of work and the more they lose contact with the society in which they live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The growth-plus part of our strategy is aimed at specific government intervention through labour market programs to break the cycle of long-term unemployment for the long-term unemployed. At the heart of that commitment and at the heart of this bill is a moral stance that we as a community cannot leave the long-term unemployed behind. They will be left behind without the provisions and programs contained in this bill and as outlined in the employment white paper brought down some months ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we get from the opposition? We get a constant characterisation that the job compact and labour market programs are just make work schemes which are no good. Those opposite characterise these schemes as a waste of money. The opposition does not understand the very strong economic argument for intervention through the job compact and its associated labour market programs. Long-term unemployment undermines the competitiveness of our economy and it corrupts our labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is understood in progressive sections of the business community and by probably one or two members opposite, but it is most certainly not understood by the leadership of the conservative parties. There is a compelling economic case to spend money on the job compact because if we do not we will pay a lot more later. We will pay through wage-price inflation as labour shortages emerge because employers and the government have not spent enough money on labour market programs to train people for the jobs that are being created by the very strong economic growth that we are experiencing. We will pay through the wage system if we do not train the long-term unemployed and get them back into the work force. We will pay socially because of the problems that will emerge because of high levels of long-term unemployment&mdash;problems such as increasing rates of family break-up, crime and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a compelling case in economic and social terms for the measures contained in this bill. The great thing about the white paper and this bill is that they symbolise the victory of a very important battle of ideas that has been going on in this country. The government is saying that it has a plan for our future work force and a plan of what type of society we want to be. It is about giving the unemployed a helping hand&mdash;not a handout, as the opposition characterises it all too frequently. We have taken an economic stance, we have taken a social stance and we have taken a moral stance that we as a community have a responsibility to ensure that everyone in our community shares in the benefits of growth. The way to do that is to break the cycle of unemployment for the long-term unemployed through the job compact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important to acknowledge the fundamental philosophical difference between those on this side of the House and those on the other side of House that I would characterise as the economic fundamentalists. The economic fundamentalists believe that we should not have the plus part of the growth-plus strategy. Those opposite say, `If you want to get more jobs and do something about unemployment, all you have to do is hack into public expenditure and cut wages. All you have to do is lower the taxation levels in this country, slash wages, slash public expenditure, and magically from the ashes new employment will arise.' They believe that suddenly all those people who have been out of work for one or two years will have employers knocking on their doors saying, `We have a job for you.' Of course that is nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people are no longer part of the labour market because the longer they are out of work the less likely they are to be in contact with the world of work. There is a very strong and compelling case in economic and social terms for the job compact. At the heart of this bill is the belief on this side of the House, which is rejected by the other side, that the most fundamental form of welfare is a job with wage and career prospects. The factor that impacts most on the distribution of wealth in the community is the distribution of jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy stance of those opposite is to simply lock out the long-term unemployed from the recovery. They come into this House and oppose the expenditure of $10 billion over four years on the job compact. They come into the House and say, `You should not be running a deficit of $11 billion. You should be running a deficit of $8 billion.' If we had to do that, we would not be able to fund the job compact. Those opposite also say that we should be lowering taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has given $3 billion a year, every year, in tax concessions to business with the aim of generating the investment that is required in this community to create long-term jobs in the private sector. But what do those opposite say? They say, `Let's give them more.' The challenge for the opposition is to demonstrate what areas of public expenditure it intends to cut to further lower taxation in Australia when Australia is already the lowest taxed country in the OECD. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has a dual strategy: to promote very strong and sustainable rates of growth over the long term and to break the cycle for the long-term unemployed. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> a few weeks ago, Ross Gittins commented that it is surprising how many people who pride themselves on being hard-headed cannot see the sheer cold-blooded economic efficiency reasons for wanting to get unemployment down. I reckon that sums up the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the contribution of those opposite to this debate so far, it is obvious that they do not even understand the economic strategy. At least it is understood by sections of the business community who realise that it is just so important for this country to make investments in what we call human capital and who understand that we should make them now so that we can ensure that the economic recovery will mean jobs for all Australians. It will mean jobs not just for those who are new entrants to the labour market or who are coming back into the labour market; it will also mean jobs for that pool of people who, without specific help, will never re-enter the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the core of this bill are measures to promote the job compact. The job compact will be very effective. We are already experiencing very strong rates of growth in the private sector. About 376,000 jobs have been created since last April, and of those about 184,000 have been full-time jobs. So commentary to the effect that just a few part-time or casual jobs are being created at the moment could not be more incorrect. We are getting very substantial job creation in the private sector and we are creating full-time jobs with careers. But that is never acknowledged by the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 4 July, the opposition spokesman on employment, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), put out a press release about the ANZ job ads survey. In reference to the survey, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This would suggest that the strongest period of job creation is now behind us.</PARA>
<PARA>In July, we had record job creation. About 90,000 jobs were created in July. As BT Australia commented, the estimate of total employment rose by an amazing 90,200, following an increase of 19,000 in June. This is the third biggest rise ever. Estimated employment has now risen for 11 consecutive months for the first time in the history of the monthly series which dates back to 1978. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we get by way of commentary from the opposition? The opposition spokesman on employment managed to publish a four-paragraph press release which did not even mention the fact that 90,000 jobs had been created. Those opposite have so little credibility when they talk about jobs. All they say is that we should not have the compact and that we should not be spending money on the long-term unemployed. They believe that growth will solve all of the problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the strongest growth: we have five per cent economic growth; we have four per cent employment growth. We have excellent prospects of that being repeated throughout the rest of the decade. But those opposite come into the House and say, `No, don't do anything about the long-term unemployed. Let's just encourage business investment.' What more can those opposite do than what the government has already done to encourage business investment? If those opposite are going to lower tax even more&mdash;as I said before, we are the lowest taxed country in the OECD&mdash;how much more will they lower it? What programs will they cut?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the last election, those opposite promised the abolition of labour market programs. They were talking about knocking people off the dole after nine months. What is their alternative now? They are opposed to labour market programs, and they think growth is pretty good. We are getting growth rates that the opposition only dreamed about when it was in government, and we have good prospects of continuing those growth rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where is the opposition's policy alternative? We have had the best employment figures in years, but that is dismissed by those on the other side of the House because they do not have an alternative program. That is why they fail to understand the essence of this bill. A job compact will give every long-term unemployed person in the country a guaranteed place in a labour market program. To make that work effectively, we need to have a revitalised CES and a system of case management in operation not only in the CES but also in the private sector. At the core of this bill, there is a tremendous shake-up for the CES to meet the responsibilities that it will have under the compact. There is also the addition of private sector competition with the CES in the case management system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be much greater emphasis on closer relations between the CES and employers. There will be much more sophisticated technology within the CES. Hopefully, through better recruitment and better technology, there will be a much more efficient CES which is much closer to the labour market system. That will put the CES and the private sector providers in a position where they can provide effective case management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the heart of the compact is the notion of a pathway. We will sit down with the long-term unemployed and talk about their needs. At the heart of the case management system is the notion that each client is treated as an individual with individual needs; that the client is able to establish a working relationship with one person within the CES; that the case manager is pro-active, rather than reactive, to the client's needs; and that, when a person is offered a place in the compact, it suits that person. When people finish their placement in the compact, they are then in a position to be looked at by employers in the private sector who can say, `Well, these people haven't been out of work for the last six months. They have been doing something productive in our community.' That is what the compact, the case management system and the establishment of ESRA are all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A central feature of this bill is the establishment of the Employment Services Regulatory Authority, ESRA. It is an independent statutory authority which supervises the case management system. It is a very important initiative which ensures that these facilities are delivered effectively on the ground and that they meet the needs of not only the unemployed but also prospective employers. ESRA will have the functions of regulating the case management system, promoting competition in the provision of case management services, and monitoring and evaluating the operation of the case management system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The myth continues. Speakers on the government side who have entered this debate have almost convinced me that there is not a problem with the unemployment situation in Australia. They have almost convinced me that our community does not have a problem with the long-term unemployed. The only problem is that that is full of rhetoric and myth, and no action is being taken with respect to anything that they have spoken about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the constitution of our great federation, Australia has faced many great challenges. Many times in our very young history we have faced challenges and, interestingly enough, it has not been the government that has solved these problems; it has been the community. I see the two world wars, the depression and perhaps some of the natural disasters that we have faced as examples of community spirit and the will of a nation to reach out and help its fellow countrymen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now more than ever we are faced with a continuing challenge&mdash;unemployment, and in particular the social sore of long-term unemployment. We as a nation need to have the will to solve this problem for it has been with us for a very long time. We need to have community compassion for those who find themselves in this dilapidating position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, having caused and continuing to add to the misery of the long-term unemployed, to its credit has addressed this challenge. But the big question on this side is: will it work? Government members have spoken much on the long-term unemployed and have devised a plan to alleviate the problem&mdash;what they called the white paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard the government speakers supporting the plan take their usual course of debate&mdash;to bag the opposition and speak on how well they are doing with statistics. Disraeli was once quoted when referring to falsehoods as saying there are lies, damned lies and statistics. Whenever members of the Labor Party speak about one of their great programs they always quote statistics, but there are other statistics. For instance, between 30 June last year and 30 March this year there has been a 15 per cent reduction in the number of apprentices in training. They never speak about these types of continual problems we will have in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They always have their own statistics. They almost convince people that we do not have a problem. But we do have a problem. I wonder whether the Labor Party with all this talk has actually been listening to anyone. Has it really been listening to the unemployed and their concerns? Has it been listening to the youth of our nation who seek jobs? Currently as many as 30 per cent of our young people in certain age groups are out of work. Has it been listening to the long-term unemployed and the problems they have which cannot be solved through current case management programs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Case management is already in place and has been for a number of years. Yet from listening to some of our colleagues on the other side you would think it was a new invention. Has it been listening to the community, which is tired of empty promises from politicians and governments? The community wants a political system which rejects the normal rhetoric and demands action&mdash;I stress `action'&mdash;from its community leaders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After listening to the contributions of my colleagues on the other side, I am disappointed that they probably have not listened to these concerns. This legislation poses a question: will it create jobs? The answer to that question, despite all the bluster on the opposite side, is that no, unfortunately  it will not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the opportunity right now to begin a consultation and facilitation process that will create work for the unemployed, yet this legislation does not address the very vital issue of work. It does not understand&mdash;and by implication those opposite do not understand&mdash;the concept that work is not generated by forcing people to become job ready; it comes from employers who are confident enough to invest in more staff. Not only does the investment mean financial costs in wages et cetera, but also&mdash;and again this point seems to be lost by my Labor colleagues&mdash;it involves the time associated in the induction of staff. Productivity down time for learning, oncosts associated with employing others, and the heavy costs associated with compliance of government taxes and other regulations are also added financial burdens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder that my colleagues opposite do not quite understand what it is all about, because none of the speakers so far have had any experience at putting personal risk into developing a business. They have very limited management experience. The minister, for instance, has no experience at business other than serving on a few boards. Most of his experience stems from being a workers' representative through the trade union movement. How can he claim to have experienced risking his own money in a business investment when he has never done it? How can he understand the thinking of a businessman when he probably holds the typical standard Labor notion that most business people are unscrupulous, which he spoke about yesterday?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should not hold the lack of business experience, and by implication acumen, against him because I am sure he has got some very exciting qualities. In question time on Tuesday he leant on the dispatch box, forcefully pointed at us and said, `We will guarantee jobs for those who join this program.' How can he, as an inexperienced business operator with no business acumen in the employment area, guarantee a job to someone after a training program? The answer, I think, lies in his broad experience&mdash;experience which is basically political. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This whole debate is a political debate based upon political point scoring. The other speakers have a similar lack of experience within the business area. They have broad civil service experience and most have union or party experience. Again they have never created wealth or risked any of their own money in business. They have probably never been out of work and, if they have, they probably have not been out of work for an extensive period. How can they come in here and expect to represent unemployed Australians or business employers if they have never experienced the problems those people face? Frankly, they do not represent anything other than the Labor party&mdash;a party of promises, a party of rhetoric and the party that has destroyed a lot of lives over the last few years through the recession that we had to have. Their cynical attacks on the opposition are so predictable these days and are driving a wedge between us in this place and the community. The community is after action. It is not after rhetoric or promises; it is after action to solve this community problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why have we not addressed the concerns of the unemployment service providers and attempted to answer some of these very important queries? How does the government propose to guarantee a job for a case managed long-term unemployed person? How can it guarantee a job? It has not adequately explained this. How long, for instance, after case management begins can a client expect a job, given that the client did everything right? What happens to the client if he does not get a job? Does he stay on the program or is he dismissed from the program? If you are phasing this program in over four years, as was suggested yesterday, what sorts of results can we expect for the long-term unemployed within the next 12 months? Again no answers are provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happens to clients if they refuse to sign an activity contract? It is interesting that the Labor Party is against employment agreements based upon productivity in the work force yet it is suggesting that long-term unemployed people sign performance contracts. If they do not sign a contract, what happens to them? That is the question we need to get answered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who will draw up this contract? Who will advise the clients of their rights before they sign this activity contract? You say that if they fail to comply with the contract their benefits will be taken away from them. How compassionate&mdash;if they do not comply with the contract, their benefits will be taken away from them! This is a fairly typical Labor way of management. It has blinkered vision; you do it my way or you do not do it any way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Please tell us, if you can, what happens if the government case manager fails to perform? You have got all these things in place for the NGOs and the client, but what happens if the government fails to perform? What penalties are there for the case managers? It is all very well to have the people on the other end of the contract with a performance agreement; what about the government's performance agreements? What happens if there is no job? What happens if a long-term unemployed union official, for instance, is out of work and rejects a job based upon his own social, health and personal lifestyle? According to you, he gets dismissed from the program and his benefits are withdrawn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate there is a lady called Jennifer who has been out of work for 17 years. She has raised a family and now has health problems arising from three car accidents in the last three years. She recently received some employment but held that job for only a week because of back problems associated with her injuries. If she is not able to hold that job, what happens to her? Does she get looked after or does she just get put onto the scrap heap? This is the problem with a lot of the Labor Party's thinking. It does not really think of the big picture when it comes to these things. It tries to throw money at a problem, but it cannot see the big picture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way this so-called socially driven Labor Party operates is unbelievable. There are further questions that it needs to respond to. The minister said that the case managers will match skills to employers, but he has failed to explain who will recruit employers and what guarantee we have that employers will join the program. We have no guarantee&mdash;yet on Tuesday he guaranteed that there will be jobs. What happens if there are no employers? He has not been able to explain that. This again underlines the Labor Party's total lack of understanding of the workings of a business enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister also said that case managers will follow up clients and ensure that when they get jobs they stay in them. But if they do not stay in the jobs, what are the implications for the clients and what are the implications for the employers under the new industrial relations requirements? This is in contradiction to what we are trying to do with this case management legislation. It is an unaddressed question which seems to bob up in some of our discussions on this side. The minister speaks of setting up area committees to somehow administer this whole program. This sounds to me like a complicated delegation of decision making. We all know what happens in committees. Different personalities get together and have a little talkfest. There is no action. What the community requires right now with unemployment&mdash;in particular, long-term unemployment&mdash;is action, yet we are setting up this whole structure of committees and all these other things with no thought of immediate action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give an example of the challenges involved in this program, which are greater than my colleagues opposite have come to realise. Sean Adams, 25, who lives in Kingsley in my electorate, has not worked consistently since leaving school 10 years ago. Sean has had case management for at least the last three years. He has had six case managers, all of whom gave him individual counselling to help him to prepare himself for employment. He has gone through three retraining programs&mdash;the average duration was at least 10 weeks&mdash;yet he continues to remain out of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last 10 years Sean has had seven subsidised jobs. On average, each lasted four months. All the jobs ended after the subsidised period. The implications of this legislation for such a case are enormous. This legislation does not solve or address Sean's position. What it will do, however, is add pressure on him for a performance contract. The government is willing for unemployed people to sign such a contract, but it refuses the same performance agreement for any employed person. A performance contract for unemployed people&mdash;is that not amazing? It also has its own IR problems. There will be major problems for young Sean in getting into this program. Let us hope it does work for him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So where is the government going wrong? I do not think it actually understands what the whole problem is about. My view is that the Labor Party is very good at throwing money at the cure for a growing problem, as we have seen with a lot of its legislation. It is very big on social issues, but it throws money at the problem rather than going to the root cause and looking at prevention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us examine some of the government's significant social policy legislation over the years; for example, that dealing with family law, the Child Support Agency, the youth accommodation support system or the child support program. No-one denies that these programs were very well intentioned when they first came in, but they are fundamentally weak because all we have done is throw money at the problem. This has resulted in an extension of the problem. It is a growing problem within our community, and we just keep throwing money at it. It has not gone to the root cause of these issues and looked at prevention. It is cure driven rather than prevention driven. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who in this House can deny that these programs do not create problems within their electorate offices? I do not think anyone here would do that. Can the minister guarantee that the signing of an activity contract by a client will not come back to haunt those already-hardworking public servants in his department with other problems? Can he guarantee to us that this will not create a new problem because of those clients unwilling to comply with the performance contract? The answer is no, he cannot guarantee it. In a couple of years time we will be looking at an extended problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the coalition do not want to be cynical about the white paper. We support full employment. But this legislation does not create jobs. None of the speakers opposite have suggested how jobs can be created from this legislation. So what should this legislation and other white paper initiatives consider to address the unemployment challenge we face?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, why did the government not ask for bipartisan support? It never came to us to ask for it. It was never offered. We have never discussed it. All we have here is a cruel hoax for the unemployed and a political exercise. If it really were serious about the unemployed, it would have come to us and asked for some support, help and discussion in solving this community problem. It is not a political problem; it is a community problem. So why not get bipartisan support instead of fudging all these rubbery figures and saying how wonderfully well we are going at the moment with unemployment figures?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the government should have initiated some business incentives to employers. Employers employ; unemployed people do not employ. Where are the incentives to employers in this legislation and white paper? There are none. Less tax on profit does not create investment opportunities for employers to employ staff. To say it does is a total misunderstanding of what business enterprise is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the initiatives really should have addressed the involvement of business&mdash;in particular, small business&mdash;to help solve this issue. Ultimately, the employers are the ones who employ people. The people who are suggested to operate the whole process do not really have any business acumen. I point to Joan Kirner, who will chair ESRA. She has no business acumen at all, yet she will be a part of it. She and her government created a huge unemployment problem in Victoria. Now she will try to solve it. I am yet to come to terms with how this will be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The debate has ranged over a lot of issues. The government has criticised us and our stance on certain issues, but it has missed one important point: unemployment is not a statistic. Unemployment is not about training. It is not about subsidising wages. It is not about business reform. It is not about long-term unemployed Australians signing performance contracts. Unemployment is about people&mdash;fellow Australians. We in this place have an obligation to them to solve&mdash;or to help the community to solve&mdash;the problem of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Australia deserve more than this political exercise. The people of Australia desperately need and deserve some action. To not face this national challenge together and help facilitate a community solution is to continue the growing cynicism that many Australians have towards this institution. It is time for action. It is time for community will. Unfortunately, this well-intentioned legislation does not meet these expectations. </PARA>

As I came into the House I heard him claim that most members opposite have never experienced unemployment. I invite the honourable member to realise that I myself have experienced unemployment. My husband and my two daughters have also experienced unemployment. So I am very much aware of the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Cowan said that we are unaware of the problems of the unemployed. Prior to coming to this place I worked with the unemployed&mdash;extremely successfully, I might add. It was during my employment with the unemployed four years ago that they provided some suggestions. Guidelines and restrictions need to be put in place that would be acceptable to most of the unemployed as an incentive to work and a disincentive to stay on the unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The honourable member for Cowan suggested the misnomer that the unemployed do not employ. I was unemployed. I became an employer and then I employed. I would like to put those facts on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Employment Services Bill sets up the case management system. I was doing case management before this bill was ever envisaged. It is probably the most important aspect of the white paper. The case management system will mean that individual job seekers are dealt with on an individual basis. They are helped, encouraged and motivated on an individual basis. Genuine individual assistance will be given to help participants find employment. It is not a new idea; it has been around for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As well as providing real help, this bill also has real teeth. The job seeker will be required to enter into an activity agreement with the case manager. If the job seeker fails to enter into such an agreement, this failure could result in the loss of the jobsearch or newstart allowance. As I said earlier, in my experience, the unemployed were considering this concept four years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as establishing the case management system, this bill will also establish the Employment Services Regulatory Authority&mdash;or ESRA as it will be commonly known. This body will be an independent statutory authority with responsibility for regulating the case management situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Let us get down to a few tintacks. This bill will do much to help Australia become more internationally competitive. If our real aim is to seek, achieve and maintain full employment, this legislation is an important part of that goal. This legislation is our best step yet towards making use of the many and varied range of skills, competencies and energies in the Australian labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will achieve the promotion of the goal of full employment. Figures to date suggest that we are well on track. The legislation sticks rigidly to the philosophy of providing a free public employment service whilst using public sector, community and private sector resources to make this goal as cost effective as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Let us look specifically at the case management system. This government made an undertaking in the Working Nation document to tackle long-term unemployment by case managing individual job seekers. This is an incredibly productive and comprehensive process which many on the other side of the House do not quite understand. Case management means a true one-to-one service and a service which is not just a fly-by-night operation. This government, like no government before, has realised that a sustained effort is required to assist eligible job seekers back into the work force and keep them there. I know from personal experience that case management, if done effectively and properly, will work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Case managers will provide a true service, and that service will provide support to the job seeker before, during and after the program of assistance. The honourable member opposite spoke about that not being an ongoing fact. Let me advise the honourable member that even in my new role these days I am still providing support for those I case managed five years before I came here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> One of the great aspects of case management is that the impersonalised service of the past is removed; it operates on a one-to-one basis. The old system had the potential to strip people of their motivation. Case management provides a true sense of ownership to the job seeker. Case managers will negotiate a case management activity agreement with all job seekers. This means that the course of action undertaken by the job seeker is specific to, and owned by, the individual. I might add that a very important aspect of case management is the fact that job seekers feel that they own what happens to them. It will be totally tailored to the particular needs of that job seeker, and it is negotiated and agreed between the case manager and the job seeker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Case managers will provide counselling and jobsearch assistance over an extended period. This entire process will be supported by access to programs, vocational training and relevant remedial courses in literacy or English language skills. Relevant access will also be provided to community based work experience or to subsidised employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The most important aspect of the case management strategy is the sense of ownership that it provides the job seeker. It gives back to job seekers control over their own destiny. No longer will our unemployed feel helpless, simply bouncing along at the whim of the labour market. This legislation provides the correct mix of the carrot and the stick approach. The case management strategy means not only that appropriate assistance is offered but also that the job seeker is committed to that assistance and obligated to pursue agreed plans and courses of action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This bill will provide case management in the areas of most need. It will also help to prevent those most at risk from becoming long-term unemployed. The short-term unemployed who are assessed by the CES as being most at risk of falling into the downward spiral of long-term unemployment will also have access to case management. Case management will also be available to those job seekers who have been registered as being unemployed for 12 months and are eligible for the newstart allowance. The availability of case management will also be extended to those eligible for job compact assistance and those covered by the youth training initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The availability of ministerial discretion is an important aspect of the case management system. This legislation gives the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) the ability to determine the eligibility of groups of people for participation in the case management scheme. This facility makes this bill flexible and responsive to the constantly changing needs of our job seekers and our labour market. There will be no need for slow and cumbersome amendment, because the minister will be able to determine rapidly the changing groups which case management should apply to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The case management activity agreement is the central core of this bill. Job seekers gain additional rights and responsibilities. This legislation will mean that included in the case management activity agreement is the requirement for any job compact recipient to accept any offer of suitable paid work or replacement under the new work opportunities scheme or the new enterprise incentive scheme. Case managers will have a responsibility to monitor a job seeker's activities against his or her agreement and provide progress reports to the CES. This has a twofold advantage on the old system: it gives far greater aid to job seekers than ever before; and it makes sure that individuals are living up to their obligations. This bill truly couples help with accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I would now like to quote from an article which David Porter wrote for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on 5 May this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the most significant changes since its creation in 1945 the Commonwealth Employment Service is to be restructured and opened to private competition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The federal government says the reform of labour market assistance is an essential complement to the job compact.</PARA>
<PARA>I inform the House that it is. Mr Porter goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will also fund community and private organisations to deliver individual services to jobseekers. A new regulatory body, the Employment Service Regulatory Agency, will be set up to promote competition in the delivery of these services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government says competition will make the CES more responsive to employers and jobseekers.</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure this will happen. Mr Porter further adds:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Included in the initiatives are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;a sharper focus on the needs of the unemployed leading to assistance which is better tailored to individual circumstances;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;a greater involvement of community and private sector agencies in providing individual services to jobseekers and allowing unemployed people to choose their case manager from the CES or a non-government agency;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;a new regional focus for the CES, with 60 area consultative committees, comprising business, union, government, CES and community representatives, will be set up to enable it to better respond to regional and local needs in training and employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government says that the focus of help for the unemployed will involve an accurate assessment of jobseeker needs and an intensive plan to assist particularly disadvantaged people. It says the goal of case managers will be to find unsubsidised jobs for clients.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All this is true and will happen. Mr Porter further writes in his article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Special attention will be available to all long term unemployed, those at risk of becoming long term unemployed, and young people in the youth training initiative. Where this fails to result in a job, labour market program help will be provided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government expects 10 per cent of cases to be managed by non-government providers in the first year, increasing to 40 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the government says the CES will remain the main agency assisting the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA>And it will. This article by David Porter highlights the fact that the provisions of this bill are simplistic, realistic and achievable. This legislation also provides for the way in which case managers will be accredited by the Employment Services Regulatory Authority. ESRA will have that power. ESRA will have the decision making ability to accredit case managers and to vary or cancel their accreditation. ESRA will also have the ability to set and vary the conditions of accreditation under this legislation. It will also be within the powers of ESRA to issue a formal warning if any case manager contravenes a condition of accreditation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be two parts to the accreditation system. The first part will set out the conditions which must be met before any applicant can be granted case manager status. The second part will set out in detail the procedure case managers must meet whilst conducting the delivery of and reporting on case management services. This will ensure that their accreditation as a case manager is maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several things that a case manager must do for accreditation. A case manager will only receive fees from ESRA. The case manager will not demand or take any fees for their services from a job seeker. The case manager must lodge all case management activity agreements with the CES. The case manager must also provide information to the secretary to DEET concerning the compliance of the individual job seeker with their own case management activity agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ESRA will also be responsible for the classes of case management services. Case managers will be accredited to provide general case management services and/or one or more classes of specialist case management services. ESRA will be empowered to alter specialist classes as increasing numbers of case managers make specialisation in areas of case management more viable. Case management specialisation may include such areas as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, those with disabilities and our youth or those persons seeking employment in specialist industries. ESRA will have some real teeth. It will not be just another paper tiger. This legislation enables ESRA to appoint inspectors with formal powers to gain information and, in necessary cases, undertake searches and seize documents. This gives the legislation a safeguard against fraud and malpractice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very proud of this legislation. It will have a direct bearing and a positive impact upon the employment situation in Launceston and northern Tasmania in particular. My own specific background actually lies in education and training and, as I said, specifically with the long-term unemployed in the last few years. I know that there are provisions in this bill that will help the sorts of people that I have helped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to put on record a couple of those cases. One gentleman who had been unemployed for 11 years because of a major car accident came to me. He had settled in Tasmania  and considered himself totally unemployable for life. I encouraged him to look for work in other areas other than where he had been trained, which was as a chef. He did that and gained employment that was suitable for him with his disabilities. He has been gainfully employed for some years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A woman who had been out of the work force for many years rearing her family came to see me. She was a trained sister in the nursing industry. Because she had been away from that industry for some time, she did not think it would be possible for her to re-enter the area she had been in before. I encouraged her, through the jobclub program, to look at other areas that she may have been particularly interested in. She could not come up with anything, so I ended up suggesting that, with the new age and the new world that is in front of us, perhaps it would be a good idea to learn to work a computer. She took up my suggestion and went to skillshare and did a course through the skillshare training program. That lady is now gainfully employed in the health department, but now she is training all those people within the health department who have the need to gain knowledge in the area of the operation of computers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In an earlier part of this debate, the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) said that the Employment Services Bill was Labor to the bootstraps. I ask the honourable member for Corio: what has he and his government done for the 13,400 unemployed people in Geelong over the last 11 years?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is part of the government's Working Nation white paper on employment. The overall package is to cost $6.5 million over the next four years, which is over $1,000 for every Australian household. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before the House deals with case management for the long-term unemployed. Case management is the provision of individual attention to unemployed people to help identify ways to assist them to rejoin the paid work force. The government's aim is to extend case management services to those who have been out of work for 12 months or who are at high risk of long-term unemployment. The initiatives dealt with by this bill are simply more costly and bureaucratic attempts to defuse the political issue of unemployment in time for the 1996 federal election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first initiative of this bill is the creation of Employment Assistance Australia, a new government body to be controlled by DEET and provide one-on-one case management for the long-term and high risk unemployed. In other words, EAA is another semi-autonomous but government owned agency&mdash;another quango. EAA will provide bulk case management services but some case management is expected to be provided by private sector groups, perhaps local community and church groups. The government expects to contract 30 per cent to 40 per cent of these services after about three years of operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The presence of government as well as private case managers gives rise to the need for a regulatory watchdog agency to be called the Employment Services Regulatory Authority&mdash;ESRA. This body will have the job of regulating and evaluating the case management system and the individual case managers, both in the public and private sectors. ESRA is also to be charged with the task of finding private sector managers and engaging them by contract to provide case management for some unemployed people. This regulatory body will also report to the minister on the case management system generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of this represents another layer of bureaucracy designed to give the impression that the government is doing something about unemployment. EAA and ESRA will join the growing list of fancy acronyms, all of which stand for various other labour market schemes which have failed to achieve their target of reducing unemployment. It is in keeping with its history, having brought about the highest levels of unemployment in 60 years, that the government contrives a few committees, task forces and new government agencies to create the illusion that it is doing something about the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's approach is to have a task force led jobs recovery, yet in this case we have seen $6.5 billion thrown into a complex web of government bureaucracy, creating a smokescreen of activities, when in fact the government's aims are as simple as hiding 200,000 unemployed people from the statistics by placing them in temporary jobs or questionable training schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case management strategy represents a total misunderstanding of what is required to create new employment opportunities and reduce the impact of long-term unemployment. The government's view is that the way to improve job prospects across the economy is to provide personalised attention and counselling to the unemployed. Perhaps the problem in the past has not been the lack of employment opportunities; rather, the lack of personalised attention for the unemployed. Unfortunately, people cannot be counselled into jobs which are just not there. There is only one way to improve job opportunities for the unemployed, and it is not done by talking about it with a case manager. Jobs are created when the government provides an environment in which businesses want to invest, expand and employ people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this government's policies in recent times have headed in the opposite direction. For example, recently we witnessed the introduction of the unfair dismissal legislation&mdash;a payback to the trade union movement for its assistance in the 1993 election campaign. Ever since its introduction, the legislation has been a deterrent for small businesses to employ extra staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unfair dismissal laws were conceived under a convention of the International Labour Organisation as a means of bypassing the Commonwealth's constitutional limitations in the industrial relations area. The government's original IR regime provided retrenched employees with an action for unfair dismissal and placed the onus of proof on the employer to prove that the termination was valid. There is no better example of an anti-jobs policy than this, and several small businesses have stated that, if they cannot fire incompetent workers without major legal hassles, they will not hire anyone. The industrial relations laws had to be amended after several prominent businessmen finally convinced the government that its policies were preventing new employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But even these amended laws have made employers stop and think twice about hiring new employees, just in case they were not suitable and the employer would have difficulty in terminating their employment. It especially deters employers from taking on people who were previously unemployed, given the increased risk involved. The unfair dismissal laws were a payback to the unions but a cruel blow to the unemployed. This is hardly an example of a policy aimed at reducing long-term unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times, we have seen increased petrol taxes which erode the capacity of private businesses to operate efficiently and competitively and to expand their operations. This has come along with a series of other backdoor indirect tax rises also adding to business costs and affecting the willingness of businesses to invest. In other words, a GST is being introduced by stealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now face the prospect of higher interest rates brought about by the government's big spending policies and now impacting on those struggling small businesses which are needed to fuel employment growth. We have seen the continuation of the anti-jobs payroll tax, which adds to the prohibitive costs of employing extra labour. The McKinsey report on regional development stated that some 29 per cent of employers said they would hire extra staff if the on-cost of labour were lower. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have the fringe benefits regime, which has become an insidious and ever growing burden for small businesses. This tax has now risen to levels way beyond its original intention and has become an outrageous tax grab for the present Labor government. These taxes and costs raise obstacles to doing business and they discourage employers from hiring new staff. Instead of focusing on ways to lower these costs, the government has chosen the other approach&mdash;to make the system more complex rather than simpler. Instead of encouraging private investment and employment, this government favours case management and more bureaucracy. It is as though sitting down and talking about unemployment will help people to rejoin the paid work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suggestion that case management is the answer is a simple delusion of grandeur. By throwing money at the unemployment issue, the government has admitted that, even if it cannot solve high long-term unemployment, it will do its best to diffuse it as a political issue. The real aim is to move unemployment to being the secondary issue for the 1996 election. Hence, the $6.5 billion package achieves little but introduces an endless stream of government-run labour market initiatives with fancy titles and heroic promises of improved employment conditions ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employment Assistance Australia is yet another government-run body designed to create an impression of action to conceal the inaction of this government. The Employment Services Regulatory Authority is a cumbersome watchdog agency charged with a near impossible task of monitoring an industry which will have hundreds of thousands of clients. ESRA will be in charge of accreditation of all prospective case managers from the private sector. If 30 per cent or 40 per cent of the services are provided by individual private sector groups, this accreditation will prove to be an enormously difficult task. The administrative costs of establishing and maintaining ESRA for the first year of operation are $8 million, which the government can see in its documentation. Spending on labour market programs generally will rise from $1.3 billion in 1993-94 to around $2.4 billion in 1996-97. Having given us high unemployment, the government now wants to throw taxpayers' money at the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even with this increased funding, questions remain as to whether the CES can handle the workload the government is handing it. By December this year, the government is looking to at least double the number of case managers, from around 1,500 to over 3,000. Existing case loads have increased dramatically. In discussions with CES officers, I have learned that individual case loads of CES officers have risen in some cases from around 40 clients to over 200 clients. So much for close, individual, personalised attention. How can anyone provide individually tailored support and advice to so many people without the whole scheme becoming impersonal and inflexible?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The entire case management program is extremely costly and of highly dubious value. Part of the scheme is the requirement of a case management activity agreement. This is a deal between the job seeker and the case manager concerning what activities the unemployed person will perform in looking for work. Any breach of the agreement by the job seeker results in the temporary suspension of the unemployment benefits. This is a positive step with which I agree. At least people receiving unemployment benefits have to justify their position in seeking other forms of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recipients of unemployment payments will have to satisfy their case managers that they really are taking all reasonable steps to find a job. However, the question has to be asked: who will determine when a breach has occurred&mdash;especially if the case manager is not from a government body? I ask honourable members: how will they make that judgment? How will the government determine this? The answer is most likely that ESRA, the regulatory agency, will have to scrutinise individual agreements and monitor individual compliance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case management activity agreement is to replace the newstart activity agreement. The newstart agreement is simply an agreement which a job seeker must enter into after 12 months in order to keep getting the unemployment benefit. After 12 months, and after this agreement is signed, the unemployment benefit changes from being called the jobsearch allowance to being called the newstart allowance. The amount of the payment is still the same. In common language, the payment is still the unemployment benefit, notwithstanding these fancy names. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anecdotal evidence has it that often the newstart agreement is little more than a formality&mdash;a series of standard questions, not individually tailored, which the CES officer asks the job seeker. Job seekers simply agree that they will perform a number of very general tasks, and this is sufficient to transfer them from jobsearch to newstart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With increased strain being placed on DEET resources, there is the potential for case management agreements to become little more than standard form contracts with little individual or personal flavour. Thus the industrial regulator, ESRA, will need to ensure that the case management being provided, both by EAA and by contracted providers, is a service which is truly of benefit to job seekers and employers alike by giving genuine personalised treatment to suit individual situations. This will be no small task, bearing in mind that effective monitoring will require ESRA to scrutinise the actions of clients and case managers closely, and many of these case managers are outside the government system. This extensive watchdog role means that the government-run regulatory agency has an ever expanding influence. This has the potential to defeat the purpose of having private sector providers in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key element of the case management scheme is its emphasis on providing services to the long-term unemployed at the expense of others. No-one questions the need to address the issue of long-term unemployment as a serious issue in its own right. However, policies which aim to assist the long-term unemployed can risk placing the short-term unemployed at a disadvantage in competing for jobs. When this happens, we create a system whereby those who have recently lost their jobs find that they are at a competitive disadvantage until they themselves have been out of work for 12 months. The result is that the majority of retrenched workers stay unemployed for a long period until they too become eligible for the jobsearch benefits which will place them at a competitive advantage in the labour market. Thus the policy designed to help the long-term unemployed ends up creating greater long-term unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The entire thrust of the government's strategy relies heavily on disadvantaging the short-term unemployed in the job search so as to facilitate the tailoring of employment services to the long-term and high risk groups. Nowhere is this more evident than in the restructured jobstart wage subsidies, which have changed to severely disadvantage those who have only recently lost their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The jobstart wage subsidies are paid to employers who hire previously unemployed people. The subsidies generally increase according to the length of time for which the individual has been out of work. Since July, the subsidies for many unemployed people have fallen drastically. For example, job seekers who have been unemployed for six months under the old subsidy rates attracted a wage subsidy of $140 per week for 12 weeks. Now they attract no subsidy at all. Previously, a person unemployed for 12 months attracted a wage subsidy of $200 for 16 weeks, whereas now he is worth only $100 for 13 weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These reductions have been brought about to increase the subsidies for those who have been out of work for longer periods, such as 18 months or more. This assists the long-term unemployed to find their way back into employment. However, it must be remembered that this takes place at the expense of those short-term unemployed individuals who have seen their subsidy rates lowered or taken away altogether. The effect of the government's policies is to make it more difficult for those recently retrenched workers to get straight back into another job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case management system is simply an extension of this same mentality. Unemployed people become eligible for case management in most cases after they have been unemployed for 12 months or more. At the 12-month stage, they are eligible to receive the intensive, personal treatment which the government has boasted about. Before the 12-month mark, they are not eligible for this assistance. This is further evidence of the way in which the government's strategy involves a re-routing of employment opportunities towards one group of unemployed at the expense of another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The irony of all this is, of course, that the best time for job seekers to regain employment is soon after they have lost their previous job. That is to say that, after a time, job seekers lose their skills, their enthusiasm and their capacity for employment. The government has recognised this fact in putting together a package which purports to be all about assisting the long-term unemployed. In fact, the result of the package is to help the short-term unemployed become long-term unemployed and then to help them find temporary employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Working Nation white paper fosters the mentality that anyone who has not spent 12 months out of work is not a priority. I would suggest that anyone who has spent so much as a day, a week or a month out of work should be regarded as a priority. In my conversations with CES officers, they have expressed to me their concerns that the government is effectively saying to newly unemployed people, `Come back and see us in 12 months time. Then we will be able to do more to help you.' Of course, in that 12-month period, individuals have lost some of their skills, much of their self-confidence and almost all of their optimism about rejoining the work force. The government has effectively taken a highly employable individual and pushed him into the ranks of the long-term unemployed, while directing its attentions elsewhere. This is the nature of the Working Nation document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case management provisions in the bill before the House are a product of the same basic emphasis. The key to the government's plan is to create, through bureaucratic means, a series of committees, task forces and labour market programs which seek to redirect jobs away from the short-term unemployed towards the long-term unemployed. In so doing, the government increases the number of long-term unemployed by providing so drastic a bias away from those who have only recently lost their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case management provisions in this bill require enormous bureaucratic involvement to try to solve a problem which is best tackled by policies aimed at creating an environment in which businesses want to invest, expand and employ people. The government, having failed to get investment going, has resorted to costly government programs in an attempt to diffuse the political issue of long-term unemployment. The creation of ESRA and EAA are unlikely, of themselves, to offer any great relief of the unemployment problem. The Working Nation document is quickly being relegated to the status of just another of this government's ambitious promises which it cannot and will not keep. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central theme of the white paper was to take the heat away from the government's economic failures in bringing about high unemployment. Rather than attack the true causes of unemployment, the government simply put forward solutions like new wage subsidies, a series of new committees and task forces and the promise of personal and individual case management. For the government to be true to its promise, it must provide case management for all newstart recipients, all `high risk' unemployed and all those under 18-year-olds who will now come under the youth training initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of jobsearch recipients whom the government deems to be at high risk of long-term unemployment is anyone's guess. Dare I suggest that the majority of the unemployed are at high risk as long as this government is in power. All of this adds up to an equation of staggering proportions. The sheer numbers of people to whom the government must extend case management are enormous. How will it achieve this? Will it try to phase these promises in gradually, the way it intends to with its job offers under the job compact? Finally, if these case management services are to be phased in over a period, how long will this period be? Is there an end to these programs? What happens if and when employment growth really does get going again and long-term unemployment ceases to be such a problem?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is one of the key points to the entire job compact and white paper issue: can the programs ever be dismantled when they have outlived their usefulness? My suspicion is that they cannot be. Not only are we left with a heavy-handed bureaucratic administration and a system which effectively operates to sin-bin people from the work force for 12 months at a time; we are also left with the legacy of labour market programs which can never be effectively dismantled when the need for them has disappeared. </PARA>

When the number of jobs is well up and the unemployment level is down, there are still problems in filling vacancies. That is because some long-term unemployed people no longer believe in themselves. Some of them do not have interpersonal skills; they have problems relating to others. Some of them do not know how to present themselves. Some of them need improvement in certain skills. Some of them need new skills. Some of them need to change their attitude to job status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem in getting people out of the cycle of being needed and not being suitable, or in some cases not being willing, is that people have not received individual attention. Do not get me wrong when I mentioned a moment ago that some people need to change their attitude to job status. I am not thinking of unemployed people alone. I am not thinking of a natural right for people to say, `There is no way I can work on a farm or sit in an office.' That sort of response, whether justified or not, can be dealt with through case management. I am thinking about the community tendency to regard a particular type of work as improper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This sort of prejudice is not new. For instance, there was a time when people buried their own dead. Paying people to do the work would have been seen as strange and quite improper. The same applies to going on holidays, when relatives used to provide the venue, or collecting water or making clothes. Even digging for minerals was once the job of people in the home. All of those jobs have long been outsourced from the home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also being outsourced are gardening, laundry, window cleaning, extra tutoring of students and the provision of meals. People are relying more on fast food, theme restaurants and home deliveries. Work that had traditionally been done in the home is now being outsourced from the home. However, if people think there will be no jobs left in the home, they ought to refer to an article written by Ross Gittins on 10 August in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. He writes:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A national survey of how Australians use their time, conducted in 1992, found that we do about 380 million hours of unpaid household work each week. This compares with 272 million hours a week of work by people in paid employment.</PARA>
<PARA>There are still 380 million hours of work being done in the home from which to draw. Households in which everyone is employed in outside work feel frustrated by the work to be done around the home but lack the confidence to employ the people who could do that sort of work. In some cases I have found when talking to my colleagues that they do not like the idea of employing servants. Quite improperly, they are seeing the job as illegitimate work, one which they are not entitled to take advantage of. We need to bring these issues together with the need to provide jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How do we bring these issues together so that we can encourage outsourcing from the home? Case management, which is what this legislation is about, is vital so that we can encourage people into the work force and encourage them to help themselves. This must be accompanied by, and in some cases preceded by, a number of other measures. One of those measures is recognition that domestic services can be big business. Business throughout Australia and the world is tending to become bigger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could consider a phased down tax deduction so that full costs are allowable for a start and no costs are allowable after a specified time&mdash;for example, 10 years. These sorts of measures, accompanied by case management of unemployed people, would make a big difference to the outsourcing of work from the home for people who want it. We could have a massive education campaign. I can see it now: Paul Hogan in a TV advertisement showing slides of his past&mdash;first of all, learning how to be a painter; working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge; having a chance interview on television, when his talent was found; and then doing a little more training. His career was already happening because he had that talent. Would it not be good to have a massive education campaign showing how people can get into the work force and, if they want to, change their type of occupation? We need to prepare people for what is already happening. We should not be making the unemployed wait; we should be encouraging it to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only can work be outsourced from the home; it can also be outsourced by business. Tax deductibility is already available. For instance, when the House of Representatives Standing Committee for Long Term Strategies visited Phil Ruthven of Ibis for a briefing, he told us how a farmer had abused him for saying, `Farmers could be a lot more efficient.' He told that farmer, `You ought to be outsourcing a lot more of your work. Everything is getting you down. You have just told me that. Why don't you have a go and try to get someone else to do your cropping, harvesting, fencing and clerical work? Plenty of businesses can do the same.'</PARA>

We now have the means of transferring equipment. Just as shearers have moved around the country for many years, the time could come when we could move farming equipment around and have people available for that work. Medical practices are gradually&mdash;not quickly enough&mdash;taking the plunge to outsource. We are realising that the doctor is not necessarily the best person to give advice and counselling in some instances or the best person to help a young person get rid of a stammer. Medical practitioners are now forming teams and are outsourcing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently I took a number of travel bureaus through my electorate and showed them some of its great tourist attractions.

When the House of Representatives Standing Committee for Long Term Strategies visited Phil Ruthven, he pointed out that we needed to take a number of steps. Those steps included freeing the work force so that people can move about. If people want to move about, we ought to make it easier for them.

The word `servile' applied to service occupations is wrong, it is stupid, it is offensive. Pecking orders that put service-type occupations lower than goods associated occupations are nonsense. Anyone who looks down on (or pities) waitresses, door persons, lawn mowers, pool cleaners, home tutors, coach drivers, delivery persons etc, has a personal problem which shouldn't be allowed to infect the labourforce or society.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to have this opportunity today to speak on the Employment Services Bill 1994, but I am disappointed that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) did not see fit to join us here in the House to participate in this debate. I think he could valuably learn from the experiences of honourable members on both sides of this House with their constituents, with companies, with CES offices, with other employment and unemployment agencies. Unfortunately, he is too busy to learn about real life in unemployment land&mdash;Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill appears to create another bureaucracy. That bothers me. It creates one more bureaucracy within a bureaucracy. This bill will create the EAA, Employment Assistance Australia, within the CES, which is an integral part of the Department of Employment, Education and Training. This will set up another bureaucracy with its own discrete statutory heads and, to an extent, will be removed from the day-to-day operations of the CES. That, in itself, might not be of concern, except it is my understanding, under directions from the minister, that the CES is now spending over 95 per cent of its resources, both financial and human, on the long-term unemployed. I will return to that later in my remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The accrediting agency which is formed by this bill, ESRA, the Employment Services Regulatory Authority, has two functions, and I would maintain that the functions ought to be separated. ESRA is both the accrediting agency and the hiring agency. That is substantially different from what one would expect in normal practice. Normally, an accrediting agency removes itself from the day-to-day operations of any scheme or operation. It does so for the logical reason that it is impossible to make the best financial decisions, when it comes to spending money, if it is also approving the agencies to whom it will give the money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It bothers me that ESRA is both an accrediting and a hiring agency. In that respect, ESRA, in dealing with case management and the long-term unemployed, will determine which individuals or organisations may be accredited to undertake case management for, as I understand it, Employment Assistance Australia, but it will be paid for by ESRA, being only some 10 per cent of the total case load management system. I understand, if I read this legislation properly&mdash;and I have some understanding of how it may work practically&mdash;that ESRA will decide which individuals and organisations can be case managers and will then turn around and hand out the work to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That creates some real problems when an individual client comes in and says, `I have been unemployed for over 12 months, so I meet all the qualifications for case management,' and the individual dealing with him says, `You can have a CES manager or you can have manager X but not manager Y because he is already filled up, and there is one spot left for manager Z.' On the other hand, the officer may simply say that the outside agencies are all full&mdash;they have met the 10 per cent quota&mdash;and there are no outside places available. So individuals are not going to have the freedom of choice that one would think is implied by the legislation and by the minister's remarks in his second reading speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the 95 per cent syndrome. I understand from a number of sources in more than one state that the minister has instructed the CES to all but cease its normal day-to-day activities of assisting unemployed people in finding employment if they have only recently lost their jobs. Over 95 per cent of resources, in terms of a personnel within CES and expenditure, is now to go to assisting the long-term unemployed to find employment, either through labour market programs or youth training wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is the case, then the CES is no longer fulfilling its statutory requirements. According to the ILO convention, which we have signed and ratified and which the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) likes to quote so frequently, it is a responsibility of Australia to have a public employment service to help the public find jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To a large extent, the CES generally operates in the low priced end of the market. It handles very little executive work and it does not handle a great deal of middle management work, except that it may handle some under the case management system, which will be of benefit as the number of middle managers who have been displaced from middle management as management structures are flattened in Australian businesses decrease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CES has a responsibility to the short-term unemployed as well as the long-term unemployed. At the moment, as I understand the job market, individuals who find themselves unemployed are likely to get little succour from CES other than simply scouring the job boards and the card index in their local CES office. That means that in order to find themselves a new job to replace the one they have lost they will have to use private sector assistance. We all know that most people find employment through either personal reference or knocking on doors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important way of finding a job for the unemployed is answering advertisements in the daily newspapers. The minister has crowed about reducing the numbers of the long-term unemployed this week. The numbers are coming down, but to a large extent those numbers are coming down because the economy has been growing. Those who are the most employable from the ranks of the long-term unemployed, those who still have skills and positive work attitudes, who really want jobs, are able to find work in the private market either through personal contact or by answering advertisements in the newspapers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Case management as proposed by this bill is a positive. I commend the government for moving in this direction. There is no doubt that, in dealing with the long-term unemployed, individual attention to individual cases is absolutely necessary. Unfortunately, today a portion of the queue of long-term unemployed is made up by people who no longer have positive job attitudes. They have either become welfare dependent or they have lost the initiative to work for themselves through one mechanism or another. It is hoped that case management will be able to assist some of those people, whether that assistance comes in the form of literacy programs, numeracy training, attitude, skill generation or whether it involves job clubs to learn how to write a resume, how to dress, how to present oneself for a job. Personalised attention via the case management system should be of assistance to the long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my view that the white paper's response to employment was deficient. The white paper is a paper on unemployment; it is not a paper on employment as such. It does nothing to encourage Australian producers, manufacturers, industry, service companies or whatever to increase their output and therefore increase their need for employees. It is all about unemployment. It is about moving the long-term unemployed around in the job queues. We will spend money on labour market programs to get the long-term unemployed off the streets, we will spend money on case management in order to find them a position in the first place, but these positions so created by the money that the government is paying employers are likely to disappear when the money runs out. The long-term unemployed will have been employed for a while and then will go back to the ranks of the unemployed. I have a great fear that that is happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employers tell me today that the majority of applicants they are receiving from CES&mdash;and this is not just in my own area but across much of Victoria and in a few other states as well&mdash;are unemployable. It is to be hoped that the case management system will help resolve that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CES, as I understand it, cannot even possibly handle the case management load that the government intends to give to it. With all of the backup, of the queue of long-term unemployed in any CES district, no more than 20 per cent will be able to be handled by case management, certainly in this financial year. That is so because of a number of reasons. One is resources; the CES simply does not have the resources. The minister has not provided the funding and the budget did not provide the funding to be able to service anything like 100 per cent of the long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An issue that arises is the lack of training for personnel who will be case managers. A concern that I have is that within CES there is a dearth of qualified people to handle the work and outside CES there is a dearth of qualified agencies and/or individuals with the proper training and skills to handle the work. With the case load that is being handled currently within CES we are already running out of qualified people. Unqualified people are starting to take the chairs and the desks. That is worrying because if that happens, and if the case managers themselves are not competent or properly trained, then the case management system will not work. I desperately want it to work because I believe it is the best hope for those who have been out of employment for a long time. So the government will undoubtedly need to do something to attract personnel both to DEET and to the private market who have the proper skills or at least who can be trained to do the job properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the selection system within this proposal an individual who is the subject of case management is able to elect whether the CES or the outside agency is the case manager. There is a danger that those who enjoy being on the dole will always pick the CES as their case manager. It might be preferable if, in deciding which of the long-term unemployed are dealt with in what manner, those with the wrong attitudes were perhaps given to private sector agencies to see whether the proper attitudes could be instilled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are those in Australia who believe it is their right to be on unemployment benefits. I well recall a gentleman who came into my office one day several years ago screaming and ranting and raving because CES had required him to fill out of all these blessed forms&mdash;why did he have to fill out these forms? It was his `right' to be on the dole. He had been on the bloody dole for 17 bloody years, he said, and it was his right to be on the dole. He did not know why he had to fill out all the forms. It is a worry, but it is true. We hope and we trust that there are not too many of those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some danger that this new bureaucracy, in trying to create a level playing field between CES and the private sector agencies, will be unable to do so because many of the private sector agencies&mdash;that is, truly for profit companies&mdash;will refuse to abide by the industrial relations agreement in effect with respect to the Public Service. So the outside agencies will want to operate under somewhat different rules than do the CES case managers. I suspect that the level playing field will not be able to be achieved. I believe that there is also some view around in the bureaucracy that some of the management in CES believe that we should not hire companies that are for profit companies; that instead ESRA should appoint as case managers community organisations like skillshare and group training schemes because they have not the profit motive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the fear within the department is that, if we let the profit motive have any part to play in case management, individuals will suffer by being forced to have their case managed by someone who is really just trying to make a buck. That really sounds like the typical attitude of the Canberra bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also have concerns about the tendering process that will be used to decide who gets what job. Tendering within DEET has become an issue of ideology gone mad. Someone told the heads of DEET that competition is positive and that we need competition in order to get the best service at the best price so all DEET's programs, regardless of what they are, should go out for tender. The community service agencies like skillshare and group training that generally work in the non-profit area are spending so much of their administration time tendering for programs that their core services, in my view, are suffering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again we are going back to the tendering process. That is the price. Once ESRA decides that an organisation meets the requirements for accreditation, it will be on the basis of tender. I suppose every case, every 10 cases or every 100 cases will have to be tendered for and the organisations will have to go through this expensive process. We are concerned not so much with the outcomes of these programs as with the tendering process itself. DEET has, to an extent, become bogged down in this process and the agencies trying to deal with DEET are expending increasing amounts of time, effort and money in coping with this massive tendering process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the government for moving to individual case management for the long-term unemployed. I have a number of very sincere concerns about the way the system will operate, and I have tried to spell those out to the House today. I am disappointed that the minister is not here to listen to my comments and respond. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

It really riles me when people say tongue in cheek that they support something and then go and give you a kick in the neck. They say that they would love the system to work, but they know it will not. The attitude of the previous speaker, the honourable member La Trobe (Mr Charles), was very much in that vein.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My first opportunity to leave school was in 1972. At that time there was what was considered high unemployment. In 1974, which was my second opportunity to leave school, there was eight per cent unemployment. That was thought to be intolerably and extremely high. A lot of wanderings, yelling and statements were made about these bludgers on the dole&mdash;these people who did not want to work. All eight per cent of them were considered bludgers. It amazes me, when listening to the comments of previous speakers, that every time we hit a recession and there are hard times it is not the fault of the people in the banks who have made abysmal decisions in relation to lending policies, it is not the fault of the international forces of capitalism which dictate this boom and bust style economy and put ordinary people down to the level of productive units; no, it is always the fault of these bludgers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spent 12 years in the New South Wales Department of Education. Let me tell the House a bit about those bludgers. When I left school most of my colleagues could go out and find a job, and if they did not like it they could go out and find another one; yet some of them were called bludgers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1980 I became a teacher employed with the New South Wales Department of Education. Amazingly, the kids I taught in fourth form, which is now called year 10, and sixth form, which is now called year 12, had the same chance I had to leave school. I had occasion to look at these people as they approached the last few months of their education. Mr Deputy Speaker, do you know what I observed? They had put in exactly the same effort as I and my contemporaries did nearly 10 years before. During all the years I was a teacher, I found that the kids did the same things I did when I was a kid. Those kids were exactly the same as me and my mates, male or female. Yet when the economy turns down they are all of a sudden considered to be bludgers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give an example of one particular `bludger'. The previous speaker would call this person a `bludger'. This person went to Warrawong High. I will not mention her name for fear of embarrassment. This person left in year 12; she had quite a reasonable pass. She sent out over 500 letters to employers seeking jobs; she got two replies. Look at the cost to her of doing that. With stamps at 45c each, we are talking about her having forked out around $200. Where did she get that money from? It came out of her pocket money. She got two replies and they were both declines. I have a great deal of respect for the two employers that wrote back to her and had the courtesy to say, `Sorry, we are afraid we cannot give you a job.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask those opposite who are used to calling unemployed people `bludgers' to reflect in their own minds and brains, if they have them, on the effect that must have had on that young lady. What effect do they think taking the time to write those 500 applications and the cost of sending them had on that individual or, in the terms of the opposition, that non-productive unit or bludger? I suggest that the effect was absolutely phenomenal. We would imagine that this person would turn around and be totally devastated&mdash;a pool in the middle of the floor. After all, she had the guts and commitment to go on; she did not give up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask those on the other side of the House: if they had 500 tries to get into parliament, would they still be fronting up looking for a job? Their party does not tolerate anyone who misses out the first time. Does that mean that a person who does not win a seat in parliament is a bludger because they did not do enough? Does it imply that these people are less than acceptable Australians? I think it reflects more on our society and system. That system is based on capitalism and the idea of competition. I am not impressed with either of those concepts. I do not think either of those concepts delivers an efficient or equitable distribution of resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Employment Services Bill is a move by this government to put its hand out to people such as the person that I was referring to. But I can tell honourable members, and I can tell the people at the table who represent the coalition here, that the case I spoke of&mdash;the case of a student from the school at which I was teaching&mdash;was not an isolated case. At various times during the recession the area around Warrawong, which is close to Wollongong, had 56 per cent youth unemployment. The background rate of unemployment reached 22 per cent at one stage. </PARA>

I do not know what it was like in other families, but even to this day I look up to my father as one of the greatest people that I have known, and I always will.

Maybe I live in a different world. I do not live in the world of the individual, where nobody else matters but me. I live in a community&mdash;a big family. My big family says that I care about other people in the community, whether I actually like them or not. If you are in a community that does care, people's wellbeing is your responsibility. I am one who will put his hand up and say, `Whilst I may not be responsible for my brother's actions, I am responsible for doing all I can to see that my brother has an opportunity.'

What would the consequences of that have been?

<PARA>I do not know where he has been or what he has been listening to, but certainly indications over recent times have shown that, with the economy turning around, those job opportunities are out there. Obviously, this amendment that the honourable member has put forward is just a lot of nonsense and shows the inability of the opposition to make any meaningful contribution in this place, particularly on the most important area of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to congratulate the Minister for Employment, Education and Training for the contribution that he has made in preparing these bills and in preparing the white paper. I also congratulate all the other people who were involved in the preparation of the white paper known as Working Nation. A lot of people were involved in that. These bills before us now bring a lot of that before the parliament and put in train a lot of the initiatives that are involved there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of those initiatives have already been instituted in the broader community through the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the CES offices and the network of people who are working to ensure that the long-term unemployed are receiving the assistance that they need. That is what this bill is all about. I am very pleased to be able to make a contribution to this bill this afternoon. Once again, I commend the minister on his contribution last night and on the preparation of the bill before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Working Nation, the government set out to do nothing  less than to revolutionise the labour market and labour market assistance. I am particularly pleased to say that these bills lay the groundwork for that long but rewarding process. The Employment Services Bill 1994 will allow the government to deliver one of the major Working Nation initiatives and to provide links with other initiatives such as Nettforce, new work opportunities and the training wage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Employment Services Bill 1994 provides for the regulation and reform of services to the unemployed. The main feature of the bill is that it sets up a case management system to assist people in finding employment. Elements of the scheme include providing a system of accreditation for case managers, including those with expertise from the private sector. I acknowledge that the honourable member for La Trobe has already acknowledged that that was a good contribution. So some positive things do come from the members of the opposition from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the honourable member then went on to criticise DEET or CES in some other ways and, as the honourable member for Gilmore mentioned before, went on to criticise those unfortunate people who are affected by unemployment. I support the member for Gilmore's defence of those people. We have people out there who are prepared to criticise those people who, unfortunately, have lost their jobs through no fault of their own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that, as members of this place, we all have people come to see us from time to time seeking help. I think that one would have to be a pretty cold-hearted soul not to feel for those people in the way that some of them feel that they have let their families and communities down because they have become unemployed. In most cases, I find that it is not their fault at all. It is the fault of circumstances which were way beyond their control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to providing the case managers for accreditation, this bill also is creating government owned case managers. It is establishing a statutory authority to regulate and promote the system. The bill gives effect to the government's commitment to make far-reaching changes through the labour market policy announced in Working Nation. The policy is aimed at reducing the unacceptably high level of long-term unemployment. Reducing long-term unemployment is considered to be an important factor in improving the efficiency of the labour market and overall economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such is the far-reaching nature of the reform program that I think the government was justified in describing the reforms as a radical restructuring of labour market programs and their delivery, to improve their impact and their efficiency. An important part of the proposal is the introduction of a job compact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is intended to ensure that people who have been in receipt of certain allowances for more than 18 months have access to paid work or work placement in specified labour market programs. It is also intended that the job provided is one for which participants are adequately equipped and which will last for six to 12 months. There is a reciprocal obligation on the unemployed person to accept the offer of work or lose access to income support for a period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The job compact also involves the case management of people who have been unemployed for a long term. Case management is an important part of this bill. It is the provision of an individual service to the unemployed person to identify activities such as training, work experience, or participation in the labour market program, which will assist in obtaining work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that we overstate the importance of these reforms when we use terms such as `revolutionary' to describe them. One particularly novel feature of the proposed scheme is allowing non-government contractors to be involved in the delivery of case management services to unemployed people. Under existing arrangements, the CES has a monopoly on providing free services designed to assist unemployed people to gain access to the paid work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While private organisations may provide such services, many of those who have been unemployed for a long period would not have the ability to purchase the service. The new system will allow a range of organisations to provide the services with the assistance of government funding. Community groups, state and local governments, private organisations and training institutions may be interested in providing, and may be qualified to provide, case management services. Many of these organisations are currently involved in the delivery of labour market programs in association with the Department of Employment, Education and Training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, in my electorate of Oxley, we have one of the most efficient, effective and successful skillshare organisations in the country&mdash;YUPI Skillshare. I am always very proud of it, and I have mentioned it before. I am the patron of it too, so I suppose I should declare that vested interest! It does a great job. Its name is YUPI Skillshare which, no doubt, some honourable members have heard me mention before. YUPI actually stands for Young Unemployed People of Ipswich&mdash;just in case anyone thought that I was mispronouncing the term sometimes used to describe ambitious 20-year-olds from the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">YUPI has been very successful in the past in labour market training programs, and has made an enormous difference to the lives of literally thousands of young Ipswich people, particularly those who are finding it hard to gain employment. It has been one of those organisations that have really taken a very close interest in young people. Not only is it providing them with training, but it also provides them with a very close friendship network and develops a great relationship with those young people. These young people know where they can go if they have got a problem. If they are feeling down after their courses because they still cannot get a job, they can come back and talk, have a cup of coffee and have a bit of a yarn. That makes all the difference to assisting those young people in some way to gain employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the obvious financial benefits that employment brings to a disadvantaged young person, there are the immeasurable effects it can have on a person's self-esteem. That is partly what this bill&mdash;and, indeed, Working Nation itself&mdash;is all about: giving hope to the most disadvantaged job seekers in the labour market. As my colleague the honourable member for Gilmore mentioned, the attitude of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has been very important indeed in bringing those people forward. It has never been more important than in the case of these young people I refer to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is determined&mdash;through the joint initiatives of ESRA, the youth training initiatives, the training wage and the various social security reforms foreshadowed in Working Nation&mdash;to take seriously its responsibility to improve the future prospects for young Australians; and this bill does just that. Indeed, the process has already started. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) has been very busy over recent months implementing many of the initiatives in Working Nation; and that goes for the initiatives in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has spent some considerable time actually going out into the broader community and looking around and seeing the cases himself. I recall that when he came to my electorate, he actually did visit the YUPI skillshare program, and met for himself many of these young people&mdash;something which I encouraged him to do, as it was important for him to meet and talk with those people, to have some hands-on experience. The points raised by the honourable member for Goldstein yesterday&mdash;that the minister was listening to, of course&mdash;should be raised by him with the minister, I would suggest, for the minister to actually follow up, if they are in fact genuine cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The members of the interim Employment Services Regulatory Authority, ESRA&mdash;which this legislation will formally establish&mdash;have already held meetings under the leadership of Joan Kirner, as we all know. They are constantly formulating plans for their operation. Of course, Joan Kirner is very capable of showing leadership and chairing such a committee as ESRA. She copped some criticism here yesterday for that, but she is obviously a person who is very committed to helping her fellow Australians. I think she is a tremendous person for the job, and that fact should be acknowledged here as well. One example of the members' commitment was their meeting in late July at the Salvation Army's crossroads project, where they met the people they are to help. That is crucial, as I said before in reference to the minister going out and about in many communities besides my own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the case management system, it is estimated that about 500,000 job seekers will be eligible for the enhanced jobsearch assistance in 1994-95. Importantly, the job seekers themselves will have the choice of government or non-government case managers. This will allow the unemployed to tap into specialist skills available in the community, which will help them in their search for employment. The numbers of prospective job seekers eligible for case management are broken up into different categories, such as 100,000 short-term unemployed at high risk of becoming long-term unemployed; 244,000 registered as unemployed for 12 months and eligible for newstart; 136,000 eligible for job compact; and 20,000 under the youth training initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill recognises the continuing role of government in the provision of case management services with the establishment of Employment Assistance Australia, the EAA, as an organisation within DEET which provides these services. The expectation is that around 10 per cent of people in need of case management services will have access to this new organisation through non-CES sources in 1994-95, with the proportion rising to 20 per cent in 1995-96 and up to 30 to 40 per cent in subsequent years, if evaluation of the program demonstrates that it is working well. The system is expected to improve services provided through the CES by encouraging competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many success stories in our CES offices. The one I have mentioned before is the Goodna CES office, which I actually opened on behalf of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), who is at the table at the moment. It certainly is a success story. In an area of high unemployment, the office is providing a tremendous service to unemployed people of all ages. The big thing they are doing there is working very closely with employers in the community. At the opening that I attended there were a number of employers who actually spoke very highly of the assistance from the staff of that particular CES. When speaking on bills such as this it is worth while to acknowledge the contribution of the staff at that particular CES. I am sure there are many other offices such as that around Australia where people are working extremely hard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the vulnerable position of many of the clients who require access to these services, careful regulation of the system through a new statutory body, known as the Employment Services Regulatory Authority, ESRA, which I mentioned before, will temper the effect of a free market. In contrast with the EAA, which is part of DEET, ESRA is an independent statutory authority which will be directed by a board appointed by the Governor-General and managed by a chief executive officer. There is provision for the minister to notify the ESRA board of general policies of the Commonwealth government that are to apply to ESRA. These mechanisms are designed to ensure that ESRA will be directly responsible to the minister, independently of DEET. Of course, that is an initiative that I welcome as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An increase in funding to pay for these and related measures was provided for in the 1994-95 budget. The annual spending on labour market programs in DEET is expected to rise from $1,342 million in 1993-94 to $2,385 million in 1996-97, largely as a result of the job compact. In addition, a real increase of $124.8 million will go to employment services, reflecting the initiatives in relation to case management as well as the increased workload in CES of additional labour market programs and new information technology requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aims of the bill are quite clear. They are to promote full employment by providing a free public employment service; and to draw on the diverse resources and knowledge of the public, community and private sectors to help achieve this goal as cost effectively as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of areas in the bill which I would like to touch on. I mentioned the employment assistance Australia scheme&mdash;a program within DEET&mdash;but the case management system is, as I said earlier, probably one of the most important parts of this bill. The bill actually deals with the case management system under which case managers provide services to the unemployed people who are referred to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important that we make some reference to the eligibility of a person for case management. Under this legislation, a person can access the case management system only if that person is registered with the CES as being unemployed and is included in a specific class of person by a written determination of the minister. The use of a written determination to set out who can participate in the scheme is designed to allow flexibility in the application of the scheme. At this stage it is intended that that determination will include long-term unemployed people, people at high risk of becoming long-term unemployed and people eligible to receive the youth training allowance. The process is spelt out in the clauses of the legislation dealing with referral to case managers. The legislation goes into some detail which I do not have the time to cover here today. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to put arrangements in place for the provision of general purpose assistance to the states, the Northern Territory and the ACT in 1994-95, consistent with the decisions taken at the Premiers Conference and Loan Council meeting of 25 March 1994. The bill will replace the States Grants (General Purposes) Act 1993, and its provisions will have a similar effect to the provisions of that act. The explanatory memorandum was presented on 29 June 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current estimate of the general purpose funding for the states and the territories to be appropriated by the bill is almost $15 billion, or around 12 1/2 per cent of estimated Commonwealth budget outlays in 1994-95. Accordingly, these payments constitute a significant element of the Commonwealth budget and, in combination with the Loan Council allocations for borrowings by all levels of government agreed at the Loan Council meeting, they have an important bearing on the spending and borrowing of the public sector as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The centrepiece of the 1994 Premiers Conference was the agreement that financial assistance grants to the states and territories will be maintained in real per capita terms over the next three years. That is, financial assistance grants will be adjusted each year not only for inflation but also for total population growth in Australia. The agreement reached at the Premiers Conference will deliver a level of funding that is significantly higher than the states and territories would have received if the real terms guarantee that applied from 1991-92 to 1993-94 had been continued. This will assist the states and territories to make further improvements to their budget positions. It is important for all levels of government to make further progress in reducing their deficits over the medium term in order to augment the public sector's contribution to national savings. The outcome of the Premiers Conference will also provide considerable financial certainty to the states and territories and should therefore represent an opportunity to focus on longer term policy challenges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major part of the assistance provided under this bill is the provision to each state and territory of a share of the pool of financial assistance grants. It is currently estimated that financial assistance grants will amount to around $14.1 billion in 1994-95. The distribution of this assistance is determined using per capita relativities provided by the Commonwealth Grants Commission in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report on general revenue grant relativities, 1994 update</EMPHASIS> and estimates of population by state and territory as at 31 December 1994 as determined by the Australian Statistician. It was agreed at the Premiers Conference that the per capita relativities recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission would be adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill authorises the payment of special revenue assistance to the states of around $516 million on current estimates. Of this amount, some $183 million is in the form of one-off transitional special revenue assistance, of which the Commonwealth will fund directly approximately $103 million and around $80 million will be funded from the pool of financial assistance grants by the states and territories. The remaining $333 million of special revenue assistance relates to payments to New South Wales and Victoria under the guarantee arrangements associated with the Medicare agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When these arrangements were first introduced at the 1993 Premiers Conference, it was agreed that in 1994-95 the Commonwealth would halve its contribution to the Medicare guarantee payments. At the 1994 Premiers Conference it was agreed that, for 1994-95 only, the Commonwealth would continue to maintain its level of funding of these payments in real per capita terms at a total estimated cost of $111 million in 1994-95. This represents a significant financial benefit to the smaller states. The balance of $222 million will be funded from the pool of financial assistance grants. The ACT will receive an additional $66 million for transitional allowances and special fiscal needs, as recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission, and will be paid from the Appropriation Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1994-95 the government will provide $350 million of identified arterial road grants to the states and territories. These funds will be distributed on the basis of the average of the arterial roads allocation over the three years to 1992. In 1995-96 and 1996-97 the aggregate level of funds will be indexed to the movements in financial assistance grants. These payments replace funding that was provided under the Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988 prior to 31 December 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As was the case last year, the higher education funding condition will again be an important feature of this bill.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last year of the Fraser government total net payments to the states, the Northern Territory and local authorities was about 9.6 per cent of GDP. Throughout the course of Labor governments over the last decade, assistance to the states has been continuously and steadily reduced. Total Commonwealth outlays to and through other governments in 1993-94 were about 7.1 per cent of GDP and will fall to around 6.6 per cent in the current financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one has a close look at the forward estimates for total Commonwealth outlays to the end of 1997-98, the trend of reduced assistance to the states by the Commonwealth is set to continue. Based on the budget's forward estimates, total Commonwealth outlays to and through other governments are set to decline further. Between 1982-83 and 1997-98 Commonwealth outlays to other governments will have declined by about 3.7 per cent of GDP. This is nearly $16 billion in today's money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Between 1993-1994 and 1997-1998, the Commonwealth will increase its own purpose outlays by about $20 billion. However, payments to the states are expected to increase over the same period by only a little over $2 billion. Although it is difficult to ascertain precise figures, during the period of office of the federal Labor government specific purpose grants to the states have grown from 36 per cent of total payments in 1982-83 to around 41 per cent today. The record of the Labor government in Commonwealth-state financial relations, therefore, is one of reduced assistance and further direction and encroachment from Canberra on how the states should spend that assistance. </PARA>

In his report on national savings, Dr FitzGerald recommended that the states should collectively seek a return to the historical trend in their general government overall deficit. The states have made great strides in moving in this direction.

Even if it were only a portion of that amount, it is obviously very much in the national interest to secure such benefits. The benefits of competition should not be lost in arguments over Commonwealth-state financial relations.

There has been one significant and divisive figure at the centre of Commonwealth-state financial relations over the past decade. That individual is no stranger to breaking faith with the Australian people. He is, of course, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating).

Clause 15 displays the very worst elements of federalism, as the Commonwealth uses its finances in order to impose its political will on the states. In this case, clause 15 seeks to enforce compulsory student unionism and seeks to infringe upon the rights of students to choose whether or not they wish to join a student union. It seeks to do this by penalising the states financially if they should allow students the freedom to choose whether or not to belong to a student union. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 15 of this bill provides the mechanism to enforce this practice. The Treasurer is able to impose a financial penalty upon those states which allow free choice to students in relation to student unions. If a state allows students to choose like responsible adults and they choose not to join, the Commonwealth government will nonetheless make up the shortfall of fees from those students who exercise their will in that way. It is going to pay this shortfall across to educational institutions. Clause 15 of this bill allows the Commonwealth government to recoup and deduct this shortfall from general purpose grants to the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The upshot of this bill will be that the states which respect the right of students to choose to exercise their right of voluntary association will have less money to spend on hospitals, schools and roads.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This clause is designed to enforce compulsory unionism by taking money from states for schools, hospitals, roads and all other essential services if they will not enforce compulsory membership. It gives an indication of the priority of this government. Its first priority in providing financial assistance to the states is, apparently, to maintain income to student unions. The reason is clear. Labor wants to fund student unions because they have been useful campaigners for it in past elections, and by maintaining their income in this way it expects them to campaign so in future by maintaining their income in this way. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party always attempts to justify compulsion because of services provided by student unions, but these services are highly controversial and in very few cases are at all essential.

We could not have students going off to Sydney to protest on their own money.

Currently student unions have a captive market. As long as student unions continue to rely upon a steady flow of income, from either compulsory membership or government largess, there is little incentive to perform in a responsible, responsive, accountable and competitive manner.

The coalition is absolutely opposed to clause 15. We on this side of the House support the right to freedom of association. We will seek to preserve it. We will move to delete this insidious clause from this bill and we will let the Labor Party come in here and vote against freedom of association.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am surprised that on a piece of legislation of this kind, the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill, which has the effect of providing almost $15,000 million to the states, the speaker leading for the opposition on the legislation, the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), spent so much of his time referring to the question of student unions in the universities. That may be a matter of some importance, he suggests, as far as the question of civil rights and so on is concerned, but that is not the essence of this legislation. I think it is important for us to give consideration to some of the much more important issues that this legislation raises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed that in some of his introductory remarks the shadow Treasurer used the figure of the proportion of GDP which the federal government was making available to the states in order to justify his claim that the value of grants being made to the states had in some way been reduced. The simple fact is that, if GDP is increasing at a rapid rate, as it did over the initial period of this government when annual growth was averaging about five per cent, even a reduction in the proportion of GDP can be represented by a value in subsequent years which itself is increasing. Of course, that is what happened with the state grants. I suppose it involves some type of verbal sleight of hand to use measures of that kind to try to prove something which is baseless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that I was surprised to hear the shadow Treasurer claim was that in some way the present government had not exercised the type of fiscal restraint which it has claimed&mdash;a claim which has been endorsed not only by the community generally but by some of those specialist interests within the community which are concerned about issues of this kind. I remind honourable members that for the first time in the history of the Commonwealth, for the first time in the 93 years that the Commonwealth has existed, there were four consecutive years in which the federal government actually budgeted for and achieved a surplus in its annual budget. The cumulative total over those four years, I think, was something like $18,000 million. It would have been very easy, of course, for this government to have prepared budgets which would have been able to absorb and utilise those $18,000 million. If you look at the figures for the total receipts and outlays of this government since 1983, when it first became responsible for the fiscal management of Australia, you will find that as a proportion of GDP they have fallen significantly. That reduced proportion of GDP, which is a relevant measure in connection with that particular issue of the total Commonwealth receipts and outlays, shows that the claims that the federal government had made about being fiscally responsible by exercising fiscal restraint can be more than adequately substantiated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other matters in connection with this legislation to which I want to make reference. The purpose of the bill is to give effect to the arrangements which were agreed at the Premiers Conference and Loan Council meeting earlier this year, on 25 March, for the conditions related to Commonwealth grants to the states and territories that were to apply for this current financial year, 1994-95, and for the provision of general purpose assistance to the states and territories. The general revenue grants which are provided for in this legislation consist of three particular forms: financial assistance grants, arterial road funding and special revenue assistance. The total of that, as I indicated earlier, comes to almost $15,000 million. The federal government is providing almost $15,000 million to assist the states, out of the centralised taxing system that we have adopted in Australia and that we have maintained since the Second World War. That system has become quite clearly entrenched in the fiscal management of the Australian economy and the fiscal relationships that exist between levels of government in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial assistance grants provide the bulk of that general revenue assistance, in excess of $14,000 million for 1994-95. An interesting point about that amount is that, until this present year, the federal government has undertaken to maintain, in real terms, the value of those grants going to the states. As inflation occurs and the real value of the grant would otherwise be reduced, the grants are increased in monetary terms by enough to compensate for that, and that is what we have been doing until the present time. As a result of the COAG meeting earlier this year, the federal government agreed to build even greater security into those grants for the state and territories governments than existed before, and in the process built in a growth element as well. What the federal government decided to do was not only to maintain the value of those grants in real terms but to maintain the value of those grants in real terms per capita. As well as compensation for price increases, there is a provision made in the grants to the states to cover population increases as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of that, the final amount that is payable to the states and territories will be determined in accordance with two indexes, one for the CPI to build in the maintenance of that real value and the second one a factor for population growth to make sure that that is accommodated as well. That is going to provide the states with about 1 1/4 per cent real growth&mdash;real growth&mdash;in the grants which are going to them. I will say more about the rationale behind that and what the federal government is hoping to achieve, quite apart from the maintenance of the capacity of the states and territories to fulfil the sorts of services that their constituents expect of them. The base level, of course, is distributed on the basis of relativities which are recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other particular point about this that I want to make mention of is the fact that the distribution of the total between the states is made on the basis of what we refer to as fiscal equalisation. What that means is that the grants to each of the states and territories will be sufficient to ensure that, if they make a comparable effort themselves, say, in terms of their revenue raising functions, the top-up revenue which is provided to them by the Commonwealth government will be sufficient to ensure that they can provide an equal level of services within their jurisdictions. I support that proposition. It has been generally accepted that it is appropriate that, in a federation of the kind that we have, in a single national economy, the more affluent and more productive areas, the areas which generate more income, will provide funds for those areas of Australia which, in terms of those industries, would tend to be less advantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I say I support that proposition, I think it is important as well for us to understand clearly what it means. It means, for example, that every person in New South Wales, as a result of those funds going to the New South Wales government from the Commonwealth government, will receive, on average, about $719. The parliamentary secretary who is sitting at the table at the present time, the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), who represents the Northern Territory so admirably, is aware, more than anyone else, of some of the difficulties that the Northern Territory faces in generating the type of production and income which is possible in the larger, more populous states like New South Wales. As I said, New South Wales receives $719 per head. To make sure that the Northern Territory has the capacity, in the light of its greater difficulty in raising revenue within the territory from its relatively limited population, to maintain a standard of services which is at least comparable with that provided in New South Wales, in the Northern Territory the grant per head is over $5,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what fiscal equalisation means, and let me say I endorse it. I endorse it to the point where I start to see those funds being inappropriately used. I will say something more about that later. But keep the figures in mind: New South Wales, $719 per head; the Northern Territory, over $5,000 per head; Victoria, which, like New South Wales, has the capacity to raise more funds within the state, $705 per head; Queensland, $872; Western Australia, $924; South Australia, $1,021; Tasmania, $1,338; and the ACT, the Canberra area, $1,092. If you look at the total payments to the states and local government&mdash;and those that I have just been referring to relate only to the general purpose payments&mdash;for New South Wales it is $1,530 per head and for the Northern Territory, $6,270. That is what fiscal equalisation is all about. It is firmly established, firmly accepted, and there are no partisan arguments about whether or not a federation, a single nation, should operate that way. The point is that it certainly should. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other form of assistance provided for in this legislation, which is part of that total of $15,000 million, is special revenue assistance. The level of this special revenue assistance, which was agreed to at the Premiers Conference and Loan Council meeting in March, will be $582 million this year. Of that, $183 million will be used for transitional assistance and $333 million will be used for Medicare guarantee payments. So the provision for the continuation of that universal health scheme in Australia is provided for under that particular allocation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other form of assistance is referred to as identified road grants. About 12 months ago, we said to the states and territories, `Look, there are the funds that we previously made available to you for roads. We gave them to you for that specific purpose. They were earmarked for roads. You had to use them for roads.' In the context of the approach by the states, the territories and the Commonwealth government to establish new types of federal relationships, the states and the territories said to the federal government, `Look, the roads, apart from the national highway system, are our responsibility. So leave the responsibility to us. Give us the money, but give it to us untied.' In other words, they were saying, `Give us the money and let us please ourselves what we do with it.' So we did, in the spirit of compromise, cooperation and goodwill on the part of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was the minister at the time. I did not favour that approach because I thought it would be abused by the states and territories. My concern has been vindicated. The federal government decided to untie on an annual basis $350 million which previously had been tied for road purposes. We said, `Look, that's identified for road purposes, but you can use it whichever way you want to.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In New South Wales, for example, the share in the first half year was a bit over $50 million. New South Wales took that whole $50 million out of road funding and applied it elsewhere. When the federal government accepted responsibility for the allocation of funds to the whole of the road network, New South Wales, together with the other states and territories, made the claim that the deficiencies in their road system were because the federal government failed to provide sufficient funds. When the opportunity came, as it did, for the states to decide whether or not those funds provided by the federal government for roads were going to be applied to roads, they chose not to do so. This financial year, New South Wales will receive about $100 million of the total annual figure of $350 million. I wait to see whether that $100 million goes entirely into its road network. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That arrangement between the Commonwealth, states and territories to provide untied identified road funds will disappear in 1997-98. Those funds will be completely absorbed into financial assistance grants. They will appear within that total. They will disappear as a line item in those appropriations. The states will then be responsible for maintaining their own roads. They will be seen as the level of government which is responsible for roads. To that extent, that is a good element of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the recent meeting of the Council of Australian Governments in Darwin.

It was designed, among other things, to open up government enterprises to competition. The states in that context made an ambit claim for 50 per cent of all future Commonwealth revenue growth. As Treasurer Willis said earlier this week, it was an absurd claim. It was nonsense. It was a claim that could not be seriously considered by the federal government, and it was not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The states at the present time take about 15 per cent of total Commonwealth government taxation revenue, but they put in this ambit claim for 50 per cent of any growth in that revenue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Between 1989-90 and 1993-94 the real growth in state tax revenue was 17 1/2 per cent. That was a period of generally recessed economic activity with the federal tax revenue falling during that time by 3.7 per cent in real terms. I did not notice the states at that time saying, `We want to share that reduction with you. We're good-hearted, cooperative, sensitive and responsive; we will share that reduction with you.' But as soon as there is a possibility of significant growth occurring in federal government revenue they make the absurd claim that they should receive 50 per cent of that growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During that period that I just referred to, the revenue of the states continued to grow rapidly. The real value of Commonwealth government revenue declined, but the federal government maintained the real value of its grants to the states&mdash;giving the lie to one of the claims made by the previous speaker.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this new formula, the Commonwealth has provided the states with not only a guarantee of the same real level of grants but also a guarantee of the same real level of grants per capita.

Over the next three years the cumulative value of that new built-in factor in the determination of grants will represent for the states a cumulative addition of $1,000 million on top of what they would have got without that provision.

It is incumbent upon this parliament&mdash;and certainly the government&mdash;to ensure that that happens and that it is delivered by the best means possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to listen to the comments of the honourable member for Charlton on the application of road funding that was made in the budget this year. On my figures, in the budget the Commonwealth had some $850 million or $860 million to spend on Commonwealth-controlled roads such as the national highway, ring roads and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we see $350 million allocated for arterial roads in this States Grants (General Purposes) Bill. It is interesting that clause 11 mentions no obligation on the states to spend that money on roads. If the Commonwealth has a real concern about the states' integrity and their bona fides as far as spending that money on arterial roads is concerned, why does it not make it a special payment? I agree with the honourable member for Charlton on this matter. We all support states rights, but the motorists&mdash;the driving public of Australia&mdash;who are paying this government something like 40c a litre in fuel tax, deserve and should expect to have that money spent on roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is $350 million in this bill for arterial roads. The Commonwealth has something like $850 million or $860 million for the roads that it takes responsibility for. Recently the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) allocated in the vicinity of $1.082 billion to local government for local roads. On my calculations, that adds up to $2.282 billion. The Commonwealth government collects almost $10 billion from road users. An interesting question is: where does the rest of the money go?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we should be spending more money on roads. I have a fairly flexible view as to how. Being a former member of local government in New South Wales, I agree that in a lot of areas the local government bodies are the best institutions to get the best value on the roads for that money. Let us not think about roads as being just the Federal Highway, the Hume Highway between here and Sydney, or the Pacific Highway along the coast. We should also consider some of the very important economic roads in local areas that are in dire need of repair. The infrastructure on some of those roads is just about to reach its use-by date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is incumbent upon the Commonwealth Government of Australia&mdash;not the states and not local government&mdash;as the prime collector of funding of taxes from road users, to ensure that adequate funding is provided for the replacement of the infrastructure on a lot of our rural roads which is not taking place today. When we divide that funding of $1,082 million amongst all the local government bodies, it is probably only enough to maintain an adequate level of maintenance on these roads. So it is an important element of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is fairly diverse. It deals with three different areas of grants to the states. As a result of the Commonwealth's dominant position in raising revenue&mdash;and I do not think anybody can argue about that; the Commonwealth is in a dominant position because it collects the majority of taxes throughout Australia&mdash;through income tax, the provision of financial assistance to the states and the territories through grants is an important element in the financial relationship between governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill deals with general revenue assistance to the states and territories. This assistance is the principal source of funds for states and territories to perform their standard budget functions. Other types of assistance, such as special purpose payments, are directed towards particular areas of service delivery or capital spending and are provided for in separate bills. It is interesting that under this Labor government special purpose payments to states&mdash;where the Commonwealth is directing the states in which area that money is to be spent&mdash;have increased from about 36 per cent to in the vicinity of 41 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">General revenue assistance is broken down into three categories: financial assistance grants, special revenue payments and identified road grants. They are the three figures that have been set out in the bill. Financial assistance grants, which account for the bulk of general revenue assistance, are expected to total in excess of $14 billion in 1994-95. The level of financial assistance will allow the provision of comparable levels of public services without requiring appreciably different levels of taxation by the states and territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Special revenue payments include the Medicare guarantee payment, special and transitional allowances for the ACT to account for the transition to self-government, arrangements for the funding of the Family Court in the ACT and one-off special revenue assistance for the states. An example of one-off assistance is Queensland and WA receiving a payment in 1994-95 to offset the reduced financial assistance grants flowing from the per capita relativities adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is interesting that clause 5 effects the amount of money in the pool of funds which are distributed to the states. The pool of funds includes some, but not all, special purpose payments for the funding of hospitals. Clause 5 sets out the formula for calculating the amount of a hospital grant for a state. This is based on certain determinations by the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) and takes into account Medicare agreements made between the states and the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">State hospital grants are used in the calculation of general revenue grants under clause 9. Clause 9 of the act sets out the equation for how the level of grants are put together. It is based on the CPI and population growth. Mr Deputy Speaker Newell, you have a rapidly growing electorate like mine. There is an increasing pressure on the provision of services by the states, particularly in education and health, where the states have the responsibility of providing these services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, it is not enough for the main criteria in the equation for the grants to the states to be based on population growth. Are we seriously looking at the change in demographics, which also has a profound impact on the demand for services in a particular area? I do not believe that we can just base it on the population factor and the CPI. We should be looking at the change in demographics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are seeing a migration, particularly in the retired and elderly population, from the southern states to Queensland. We have just seen a redistribution in Queensland and Victoria. Victoria has lost 75,000 voters from a seat; they are now in Queensland. So the demographics in parts of Queensland will also change. There will be a change in the demand for different services. That might heighten the demand for health services in that part of Queensland and lessen the demand where people are moving out of the southern states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These things need to be seriously considered on a bipartisan basis and certainly on a federal basis between the Commonwealth and the states. This issue is all about how we, as elected representatives, distribute the taxes that are collected from the people of Australia. The people of Australia have a justifiable expectation that taxes be distributed on an equitable basis and that they provide an efficient amount of service to people throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Clauses 10 and 11 deal with arterial road grants. The total amount granted is $350 million. The amounts granted to each state and territory are specified in the schedule. It sets out the amounts that are being distributed to the individual states and territories. Clause 11, which is the interesting clause, provides that a state or territory may use the arterial road grant for a purpose not connected with roads. Why give it to the states as a road grant? Why does the government not say, `We'll put that into the financial assistance grants'?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It might, but it is also incumbent upon the Commonwealth to ensure that an adequate amount of funding collected from the taxpayers of Australia is put back into roads. It raises a query in my mind about having that clause in the bill. This is the second year in a row that it has been included in it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, this clause provides that each state is entitled to financial assistance additional to its financial assistance grants to an amount of $350 million for arterial roads. It then goes to say that the states need not spend this money on arterial roads. It is quite ambiguous. It is no wonder that sometimes the taxpayers and voters of Australia become a little concerned at why some government bills are so ambivalent in their meanings. It raises the question as to where the other $7.7 billion collected from road users is. We have spent $850 million on Commonwealth roads, $1,082 million on local roads and $350 million on arterial roads, but we in the opposition maintain that another $7.7 billion paid by the road users is floating around somewhere and may be propping up some other area of government spending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important aspect of this bill is obviously clause 15, and the opposition has moved an amendment that the clause be deleted. We will vote against that clause when it comes to that stage of dealing with this bill. It has absolutely nothing to do with states grants. States grants should be about the devolution of the funds collected by the Commonwealth for the states to spend in the areas that, under the constitution, the states have responsibility for, such as health, education and roads. States grants should not be used to fund and propagate the notion of the Australian Labor Party that there should be compulsory unionism, particularly in the universities of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second condition is set out in clause 15. This allows the Commonwealth to reimburse itself for payments made by the Commonwealth under the Higher Education Funding Act 1988. The HEF Act allows the Commonwealth to provide financial support  for student organisations in tertiary institutions where the ability of the institution to support the organisation is affected by the activities of a state. The mechanism is designed to discourage state governments from banning compulsory student organisation membership in tertiary institutions. If a state law bans tertiary institutions from having compulsory student association membership, the Commonwealth may make a payment to support the association and then deduct the amount of the payment from the financial assistance payable under the bill to the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is compulsory unionism. What happened to freedom of choice? We hear from members of the Australian Labor Party about freedom of choice and human rights only when it suits them; when it does not suit them, we do not hear about these principles. Compulsory student unionism is founded on the principle that students of an institution must belong to the student association of that institution. Students are forced to join a given student association, regardless of whether it offers or represents the needs of themselves or of their fellow students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Students choose not to belong to student associations or unions for several reasons, including political reasons. Presently, the ANU is run by greenie leftist factions with large ties to international socialists. The provision of services has suffered greatly under this political party which has been able to maintain power for several years. Some students may feel that in this situation the general services fee&mdash;that is, the joining fee&mdash;to the institution, part of which goes to the student association, is wasted and therefore decide not to join the association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Should it not be incumbent upon all Australians as to whether they belong to a union and should it not be incumbent upon all students attending university as to whether they belong to a student union? Not under this government. This government is going to make the taxpayers of Australia pay for student associations and compulsory student unionism whether those students want to belong to it or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill almost assures that compulsory student unionism will become a regular feature of all Australian universities, given that states in which voluntary student unionism exists will need a financial helping hand from the Commonwealth for the maintenance of some student organisations. In this situation, any amount of money paid by the Commonwealth to make up the shortfall is a debt due to the Commonwealth from the state. It can be deducted under this clause from a payment due under this act. The point here is that the Commonwealth will penalise those states that allow freedom of choice for their student populations by taking money out of other grants to fund student unions that cannot hold and attract voluntary membership. So other aspects of our communities that are funded by the states in areas of education, health, roads and the like are going to suffer because this Commonwealth Labor government wants compulsory student unionism in the universities, regardless of what the state governments do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The taxpayers of Australia will suffer in other areas of state services so that this Labor government can achieve its ambition of having compulsory unionism. It is certainly reprehensible. The people of Australia and the taxpayers of Australia should be made well aware of what this measure is all about instead of having it hidden in a states grants bill which, to most people, would seem like a fairly innocuous piece of legislation which is only enabling the government to go on and make the necessary payments to the states after a budget in the financial year. It is hidden away in this bill where it should not exist; it should be out by itself where it is transparent and can quite easily be seen by the general public of Australia so that this government can be held accountable for what it is doing in this regard. I hope that this debate is well and truly reported across Australia; it needs to be so that the people who are paying taxes in this country know where this Labor government is spending those taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will run across some of the main issues. Should the federal government have the right to extend its powers given that there has been no change to the constitution to allow it to do so? The question must be asked. Under consecutive Labor governments specific purpose payments have risen from about one-third to more than one-half of the federal government's payments to the states. Originally, the founding fathers of the Australian constitution set out the federal government's responsibilities to include foreign affairs, defence, trade, immigration and monetary policy. Today, however, the federal government controls a monopoly of power in health, education and transport through the specific purpose payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present practices of the federal government in overriding state powers is only poisoning what could be a very beneficial relationship with the states, particularly in light of the recent COAG meeting where a much better arrangement should have been arrived at in trying to get a federal approach to national competition policy. Efficient federalism does not deny intervention in areas traditionally regarded as state affairs. It requires that the federal government be very discriminating in its decisions to intervene. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It could be noted that the federal government's overhandedness and heavy-handedness in terms of state-federal relations has direct parallels with the behavioural attributes of the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating). That is exactly what we have seen happen. I will finish on that note; I think it is about where the honourable member for Charlton finished. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in Australia are at a stage where the Hilmer report is being taken very seriously by this Commonwealth government, by this parliament and by all the states in Australia. The implementation of national competition policy is going to make this country more efficient and more competitive. There will be a windfall to the Commonwealth government. It is very hard to quantify that at this stage. All sorts of figures are being bandied about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of the pain in achieving a national competition policy is going to be borne by the states. The states had every right to ask the Commonwealth for a fair share of the spoils which the Commonwealth will ultimately receive from the national competition policy. To date, the Prime Minister has taken a fairly paltry attitude in dealing with the states in negotiating how that is going to be broken up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this Labor government were fair dinkum about trying to generate more employment in Australia, it would consider reimbursing some of the states with the windfall it will receive from the competition policy&mdash;maybe to see the states abolish some of those iniquitous payroll taxes that they collect to prop up what they do not get from the Commonwealth government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For two reasons it is timely for the parliament to be considering and debating the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill. We heard this from the previous speaker, the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile). The first reason is the agenda for national competition policy and the problems encountered at the COAG meeting last Friday. I say at the outset that it is a strange notion of states rights and state responsibilities for each of the state governments to be saying that there is something good that can be done for the nation that will produce extra economic growth, but they will only do it if they are compensated and given sympathy for their particular circumstances. The role of government is to do the right thing, because it can improve the quality of life and the standard of economic development in Australia, not to only do the right thing if compensation is received.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Professor Hilmer pointed out yesterday, the rewards in government revenue out of national competition may not be substantial. The whole point of a competitive market is that businesses have lower profit margins, and as a result the flow-on benefits in revenue to the Commonwealth government may be much less than has been projected. For the states to be arguing, probably on a flawed premise, that they need some compensation before they will do the right thing is repugnant and contrary to the values of good government and good responsibilities in public life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason why it is timely to debate and consider this legislation relates to the issue of human rights and states rights. Again, the honourable member for Lyne touched on this issue. It is a timely issue because those on the other side are having their own debate about the importance of human rights and states rights. The small `l' liberals, the few that remain within the Liberal Party, are stacked up against the big `C' conservative redneck majority within the coalition. I wish the small `l' liberals all the very best because we all understand that a genuine liberal party would always put individual and human rights first. The point is not understood by those who want to prop up the states with offensive laws. The point is that governments do not have rights; people do. The people that we serve and for whom we legislate hold those rights and they must be respected under all circumstances. I will address both these issues&mdash;federal reform and states rights versus human rights&mdash;in my speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian federalism has been stubbornly resistant to change. The founding arguments of federalism in 1901 about state rivalries and the tyranny of distance now look outdated. Real geographic distinctions in Australia are regional; they are not between the states. Only by tackling the problem of regional inequality in Australia can we move towards one nation. An obvious measure is to reform the charter by which federal authorities allocate grants to the states and local government. State boundaries drawn at Whitehall last century have shown themselves to be an irrelevant guide to locational inequality. For instance, it is absurd to suggest, as the Commonwealth Grants Commission does year after year, that community needs in Hobart and Darwin are two to seven times greater than those in Campbelltown, which is in my electorate, and Blacktown in western Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Questions of equity and service delivery need to be judged on a regional rather than state basis. With limited government resources, funding formulas must be prepared on the basis of need between regions to take away as well as give. There was a good example of this principle of regional equality associated with the COAG meeting last week. It was announced that the Northern Territory parliament had been opened and constructed at a cost of $160 million. There is something wrong with a federal system of government and funding allocations when a parliament which serves a population of 150,000 people and sits 30 times per annum can be built at a public cost of $160 million. This would not be so bad if it were funded solely out of revenue sources raised in the Northern Territory. The truth is that the Northern Territory budget is 80 per cent supported and funded by federal taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own electorate, the local government area of Campbelltown has 150,00 people&mdash;the same number as the Northern Territory&mdash;but we would struggle, in adding up the value of local and federal government public buildings in the Campbelltown area, to come to a collective value of $160 million and match the money spent by the Northern Territory conservative government on its parliament. There is something wrong with a system which places greater weight on funding for states and territories than on funding for regions when in Australia the real difference between geographic areas are more on a regional than state basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite may say that regionalism is wrong and that it is not written into the Australian constitution. There is an argument to say that it is nothing new and nothing to be feared in Australian government. The states have shown that they prefer to run their own system of government on a regional basis and style than according to outdated state boundaries. For instance, in my own state of New South Wales, the following services and functions of state government are organised on a regional basis: school education, electricity distribution, health regions, economic development boards, water distribution, RTA regions, public housing and police. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have regional government in Australia. It has been organised by the state governments in recognition of that fundamental principle: the difference between areas on location in Australia is more between regions than states. This is a basis for more equitable funding formulas to be developed by federal and state governments. Common boundaries between those regions would assist, but the real reform of lasting significance to the great bulk of Australians who live in cities and outer urban areas, such as my electorate, would be to reform the funding distribution and produce greater equity in the distribution of funds. That goes to the heart of this legislation about state grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advocates of states rights are running their states on a regional basis but with too little regard for the equitable distribution of funds between regions. Perhaps the federal government needs to do more work in this area. The government has done a great job on the economic fundamentals, but too little time has been devoted to working out where the money goes according to federal and state funding formulas and its impact on the regions and this important issue of regional equality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real problem in the allocation of funding for social infrastructure is that people are mobile but social capital is not. A very important political task is to make sure that services and funding move in a mobile fashion to where the people are moving. This is a basic principle in the outer suburbs of Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne. The funding allocation tends to be inelastic and immobile: the funding proportion is not moving equally to match the population movements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to go back to some basic principles first developed in my own electorate by one of my predecessors, Gough Whitlam. He said that in Australia the quality of life is determined by access to community services as much as the pay packet that people take home. In areas where the private level of income is not high, there is a great responsibility for government to provide the community services that only the public sector can provide to improve the quality of life. If the federal government, raising 80 per cent of the revenue within the Commonwealth, does not finance those community services, then they are bound to be financed inadequately, unfairly financed or not financed at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever the revisionists say these days about Whitlam and his program&mdash;I think the commentary is much kinder as time goes by&mdash;those two principles are still correct and should still be built into the way in which state grants and funds by the states are distributed to each of the regions. These questions of distribution are very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a great concern on the issue of housing. In my electorate of Werriwa, the four public housing estates at Glenquarie, Minto, Airds and Claymore require renewal and rejuvenation. They have been neglected by the state government, are badly designed and are isolated with few employment opportunities and community services. This problem tends to be common around the nation. The great victims of urban design in Australia tend to live in public housing estates, not the inner city. Any government focus on urban design and funding for urban programs should be based on those public housing estates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the Commonwealth there are $31 billion worth of assets held by public housing authorities but without a clear strategy for redevelopment or renewal. The Keating government has given a good lead to each of the state authorities. Through the Defence Housing Authority and some of the demonstration projects of the better cities program, it has shown the way in which these estates, at relatively low cost, can be redeveloped and transformed to uplift and improve the quality of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an example, look at Holsworthy, near my electorate in Sydney's south-west, redeveloped by the Defence Housing Authority, or Elizabeth in Adelaide in the electorate of my colleague the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) renewed out of the better cities program funding. In these areas there have been lifestyle initiatives: improvements to the facades of the housing, landscaping and streetscaping improvements and traffic management&mdash;a total suburban facelift and transformation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a very important point. The people are not the problem; urban design has been the problem in those estates, which has led to a range of social problems. We need to go to the heart of those design questions, use those demonstration projects and set a goal in the Commonwealth-state housing agreement to be renegotiated at the start of 1995. This would be a great opportunity to say that within 10 or 15 years each of the public housing estates in Australia will be renovated and renewed as part of a great national objective at a workable cost to the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opportunity is there to lift up the expectations and confidence of people who live in those estates and show that a bad urban environment produces social problems&mdash;it is not essentially the fault of public housing tenants. I have been working with some of the officers and staff from the office of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) to bring these objectives about in Werriwa. I could not think of any program that would produce a better result or a more commendable outcome for this government in terms of equity and good Labor values than to renew those four housing estates in the Campbelltown local government area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned earlier the question of human rights and states rights. When we talk about federal-state relations and state grants it is very important to consider these constitutional questions. I know it is even more important on the other side of the chamber because I have been reading about it in circulated material. For instance, yesterday the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), the young fogy from Warringah, had published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> an article which said that states rights matter more than human rights and that the federal government, in condemning the sexual practice and anti-privacy laws in Tasmania, should not be overriding the rights of the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see that the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) has entered the chamber. I would like to congratulate him on an outstanding article in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. The honourable member for Aston has said that the Liberal Party should support Labor on these sex laws in  Tasmania. This goes to the heart of the issue for the liberals within the Liberal Party. They realise that no genuinely liberal party in the classical sense would override the rights of the individual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The circulation and publication of material goes further. I was somewhat surprised to receive in my mail tray last night a circular from the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles). He is even circulating to members of the government on this issue. The circular was a collection of statements made by the former Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson). The member for Braddon is obviously distributing this material to try to hold the line within the Liberal Party, hoping that somehow we will use this material to embarrass the opposition into repeating the stance that was set by the former leader. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We enjoy these sorts of debates, but I do not think anyone ever expected circulated material like this by members of the opposition. Nonetheless, it makes the very good point that governments do not have rights; people do.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An inherent feature of the laws that are the problem in Tasmania is that they are trying to place restrictions on sexual behaviour. Sexual behaviour is an inherent feature of one's character and personality. Whenever governments have legislated to outlaw or to modify the inherent features of human nature it has gone down in history as tyranny. It has been noted as a feature of fascist governments through the ages. It is known as tyranny. This parliament should stand up against laws of this kind, laws that put tyranny and fascism ahead of the rights of the individual to express those inherent features. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should point out for the benefit of the parliament and the media that all the concentration has been on how these laws impact on homosexuals. The truth is that the laws apply equally to heterosexuals and homosexuals. It all depends on the definition of an `unnatural act'. We have the government of Tasmania wanting to define for its population what is natural and what is unnatural in the privacy of the bedroom. That is not the role of government. People should not be in this parliament if they think that states rights matter more than the rights of this federal government to say that the Tasmanian government is wrong. Tasmanians are also Australians. As long as this parliament has the external affairs power, has the relevant international treaty and can act on these privacy issues and provide a relevant safeguard then it certainly should. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I call the Prime Minister with ministerial arrangements, I want to inform the House that on Saturday, 27 August it will be the 40th anniversary of the employment in the Department of the House of Representatives of Mr Lyn Barlin, the Clerk of the House. Lyn came to the Department of the House of Representatives on 27 August 1954. In March 1969 he was promoted to the position of Serjeant-at-Arms; in January 1977, to Clerk Assistant; in September 1982, to Deputy Clerk of the House, and registrar of members' interests as part of that position; and on 25 March 1991 he was appointed Clerk of the House, the pinnacle of his career in the Public Service.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, as one who has been here slightly longer than many, I would like to echo the sentiments you have just expressed. The clerks of this place serve us all, whatever our politics, remarkably well. I have always found it difficult to describe them. While not as weather worn, I have always thought of them almost as sphinxes of the parliament. They see all and hear all&mdash;they perhaps should be sphinxes with a memory for they remember all&mdash;but they have no opportunity to speak.</PARA></TALK.START>

I would like to pay personal testimony to the way in which Lyn has acted in a totally dispassionate way on all occasions and for all governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, one aspect of his career that I specifically wanted to mention that I do not think was in the detail to which you referred was that for a time he was seconded to the Prime Minister's department to work with the parliamentary counsel. I would commend to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that practice, for many of those who work within the parliament have little knowledge of the processes of the legislation committee of the government of the day, yet in this place they are responsible for ensuring the passage of that legislation. I have often felt that there would be an advantage if there were greater liaison, contact and understanding between the officers of the parliament and the officers of government who in fact are responsible for drafting and preparing legislation. Lyn Barlin is a great servant of the parliament and I commend him for those 40 years of very diligent and effective service. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I join with the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and you in congratulating Lyn Barlin on this milestone of 40 years of service with the Commonwealth and the House of Representatives. He came from a very distinguished line of predecessors right back to the famous Mr Green who was the clerk in Victoria when the parliament moved to Canberra in 1927.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that in most places in the bureaucracy there is a hierarchy, but there certainly is in the House of Representatives in the clerk's office. That is why people do not become clerk without a long period of service, demonstrated competency and, as the right honourable member for New England said, that impartiality which they are able to bring to the task, and which Lyn in particular has brought to the task, on which members can rely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I first met Lyn Barlin when I came here in 1969. The enthusiasm, good nature and good cheer with which he has done the job has always surprised me, given that staff are sometimes placed under some provocation or pressure by events in the House and by other things. But Lyn has weathered that storm with equanimity, good cheer and good sense, and we appreciate that. The other thing is that he has made no mistakes, unlike that which occurred in another place recently on a major piece of legislation. He actually gets it right as well. Congratulations, Lyn. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I would like to join with you, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in congratulating Lyn Barlin on his 40 years of service.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, in my time as a member of the House of Representatives, which is getting on for 10 years, I have found Lyn Barlin's approach one of total professionalism and dedication. As the Prime Minister said, I imagine that it would be a job in which one would encounter enormous difficulties and occasionally a fair bit of provocation from the fiery nature of the profession of politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lyn Barlin has always fulfilled his tasks with a great sense of impartiality. His professionalism extends beyond impartiality. His professionalism, and I think the professionalism of the clerks generally, while I have been here, extends to making members of the House look more professional than perhaps they sometimes are. For example, speakers and deputy speakers are occasionally&mdash;and this is no reflection on you, Mr Speaker&mdash;at a loss as to what the next procedure may be, and the very rapid and thoughtful intervention of the clerk so often has made the proceedings of the House work well. I think Lyn Barlin has set a great example there. To make members of parliament look good in almost every circumstance is one of the definitions of great professionalism. So I would like to congratulate Lyn on his 40 years of service, and I look forward to working with him over many years ahead. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Given that the Reserve Bank in its annual report yesterday gave a very clear message that the government's deficit reduction strategy was not good enough, will the government now recast its budget to forestall any further rises in interest rates? If the government will not do that, will it give Australians an assurance that there will be no further rise in interest rates in the next 12 months?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="385" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BLAXLAND" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought the annual report of the board of the Reserve Bank was a very helpful report. When read in context, it talked about the progress the economy has made. It looked at the trends, particularly in the Asia-Pacific markets with which Australia is now closely linked. Generally, it was a helpful reflection upon public policy in the economic area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of the deficit, the report talked about hopefully something better than one per cent of GDP. I remind the House that the government's forecasts at the moment for 1996-97 are for better than one per cent of GDP. I also remind the House that the OECD, in its latest report, regarded the one per cent of GDP by 1996-97 as realistic and appropriate. Of course, it will take us much further than most OECD countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is worth recalling that the budget deficit is estimated to fall from three per cent of GDP in 1993-94 to 2 1/2 per cent of GDP for this year, which is a decrease of around $2 billion. In 1996-97, back through the period of growth following the recession, there will be an adjustment in fiscal terms somewhere towards the level of $10 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1980s the government presided over a period of fiscal consolidation, brought the budgets into surplus, but it was not able to simply weigh off the recall on savings from a very large investment phase and the growth in credit that ran at an annual rate of 20 per cent in the last couple of years in the 1980s. Fortunately, that is not happening now. Banks, having been burned in the 1980s, are now more careful about their lending policies and credit growth is more restrained. Therefore, the government will manage economic policy with an appropriate balance between monetary and fiscal policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed that the Leader of the Opposition was out months ago touting interest rate rises. Of course he would have seen, and in fact wanted to see, those costs borne by Australians for months and months when obviously they did not have to bear them. The Treasurer has already given the House an explanation of the adjustments in monetary policy. He has certainly given that at a press conference and in public. With the accord, with the restraint on wages, which we have successfully been able to engineer now for 11 years, with monetary policy and with fiscal policy we believe we can secure a sustainable recovery. I just remind the House again that we are growing at five per cent, we have had four per cent employment growth&mdash;</PARA>

It is 70 per cent of the way in 40 per cent of the time. So we are seeing this very strong linkage between employment and GDP, and sustaining the growth in the economy is what it is about.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very happy to report to the House that as a result of the Council of Australian Governments we have yet again kept the progress on the Hilmer report moving solidly. Extending the Trade Practices Act to public authorities is a very large change in the way in which public authorities function. Of course they have been extended to Commonwealth authorities for 20 years, but applying them to state authorities is a change of some substantial magnitude and it will be a very important thing in competitiveness terms that that has happened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found disappointing about the meeting that we had the irony of a Labor government again trying to induce competitive notions into the economy in the face of coalition premiers and chief ministers who supposedly embrace the market&mdash;except where it comes to their own authorities. After some negotiations and discussions throughout the day, some substantial agreement was made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think all Australians should understand how important this is for them, with lower prices for consumers, cheaper inputs for business, faster growth and more jobs. Things such as electricity prices and water and gas access and pricing can make a substantial difference to business and to consumers. It is important, therefore, that we succeed in getting these competitive disciplines in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have some of the premiers essentially signed up to it. Others are dragging the chain. I was disappointed that Premier Kennett was basically nobbled by the Victorian legal profession. He was not going to chance his hand if we were extending trade practices principles to unincorporated persons in the way suggested by Mr Hilmer. He said that the only way he would deal with us was if we gave the states half of all future growth in revenue from here on out. In other words, we were asking them to adopt competitive disciplines after their preaching to us the value of the market. They said, `At what price do you want to buy us off? The price is that you can buy our favour for a pro-competitive stance if you give us half of the growth in Commonwealth revenue from here on out.' Need I say, it did not take either the Treasurer or me very long to get across that proposition and to reject it out of hand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Fahey, for his part, thought we were not offering enough in terms of any benefit to the Commonwealth budget that might have come as a consequence of the Hilmer changes. Western Australia wanted to tell us that it was really quite upbeat about competition, but it wanted its own trade practices act and it wanted its own competitiveness regime. I said, `For the purposes of national companies'&mdash;and there are many which operate across the states&mdash;`having what may be mirror legislation in the states one day, in year two and year three and year four they will be different acts, and over time we will have six different trade practices acts applying to companies. Can this be good for business and can it be good for competition policy generally?' I doubt very much that it will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage we have a general commitment to the adoption of the Hilmer principles to extending the Trade Practices Act to the state authorities and to unincorporated enterprise. I am hoping that at the February meeting in Adelaide we can work through these things. The South Australian Premier will need to do better than he did at the last meeting. He opposed every measure. This is somebody who is supposedly embracing the market. He opposed absolutely everything. He was the sole person who opposed the lot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are in an interesting situation with the states. In February they said to us, `We will adopt this in principle. Give us a go at the financial meeting in May'&mdash;that is, the Premiers Conference. We did. The Commonwealth, for the first time, has given the states for three years real terms per capita funding. That is not just maintenance of their payments in real terms; it has a population growth factor in there as well of about 1.5 per cent growth in the payments above inflation. And we said we would give them a share of any improvement in revenue that comes to the Commonwealth by virtue of the Hilmer changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our officials then sat down for the better part of six months and worked up a communique, which was agreed by all state officials. When we arrived at the meeting, the states then disowned the work of their own premiers department secretaries and personal office managers. As a consequence, now they are saying, `The only thing that goes at a COAG meeting is what we agree on&mdash;which is formally agreed or in the process of agreement by officials,' in what is of course a huge range of complex issues. As a consequence, at the next meeting we will be seeing whether the communique process and the officials' involvement in all this will be important or whether we will have to do as we did at the last meeting, which is battle away to get some competitive notions adopted by a handful of Liberal and coalition premiers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I do not know where federal opposition members stand in this. I do not think they are for competition these days. Competition was always their big go, but they have been strangely silent about Hilmer and left it to their state counterparts. I presume that this is a matter of state rights as well.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Drought is a big problem. As the questioner said, I was in Dubbo yesterday. I will give an example. The Dubbo region was drought declared from May to July 1993, from July to October 1992 and from April 1991 to February 1992. It comes off, it comes on and it comes off. What one needs is a longer term policy to deal with it. That is where the rural adjustment scheme comes in. In other places, the impact of the drought has been more prolonged and more severe. That is why additional financial assistance has been provided to people who are severely drought affected. In the main, that has been in Queensland and New South Wales.</PARA>

There are two tests&mdash;that is, getting the farm's act together, and/or whether it has been viable without RAS support over two of the last five years. That is how it applies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to assure the honourable member for McMillan that we do adhere to the budget forecast of a 14 1/2 per cent increase in business investment which at the time it was made created some controversy. There were expressions of disbelief in some quarters, including from opposition members, who called it an heroic assumption. I must note, however, that quite a number of private sector forecasters also agreed with us on the general likely increase in business investment in this forthcoming year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the reason for the expressions of disbelief was that business investment had been growing very slowly over the last couple of years. As we have come out of the recession, business investment has been little more than flat and, in those circumstances, it was seen as an extraordinary turnaround to get such a large increase coming in the forthcoming year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to be able to advise the House that the figures released today for the private new capital expenditure for the June quarter of this year show that actual capital expenditure by the private sector in the June quarter increased by eight per cent. For plant and equipment it was 14 per cent, and that is the highest level of investment in plant and equipment we have had since the 1990 September quarter. But it is the expectations data for 1994-95 which is even more important than the actual investment which occurred in the June quarter of the last financial year. The capital expenditure expectations data for 1994-95 has been collected for the past three quarters&mdash;the December quarter of last year and the March and June quarters of this year. In those three quarters, we have seen that the expectations of business of what they will actually spend on investment in 1994-95 has increased by 28 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the actual investment generally exceeds the expected level so, whatever business forecasts as its expected level of expenditure, you can almost be certain&mdash;particularly at a time of economic recovery&mdash;that you are going to be seeing actual levels of expenditure well in excess of the expected levels. Indeed, this level of actual outcomes over expected outcomes is called a realisation ratio. It is a slightly technical term but it simply covers that concept. In relation to the ratio of actual to expected outcomes, we forecast in the budget an outcome for 1994-95 which was 43 per cent higher than the then existing level of expectations. That was another reason why people thought it was unduly high. But, given the improvement in expectations now, that ratio has come down to 1:12. In other words, only 12 per cent more of actual investment is required now over the expected level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That ratio of 1:12 is exactly the same as we had in the last financial year&mdash;1993-94&mdash;so it is an eminently achievable outcome. On the figures of expected expenditure produced by business today, the budget forecast figures for investment are now quite clearly realisable without any sort of gross expectations about realisation ratios. Simply, the one that applied in 1993-94 applied to that level of expectations will give you the outcomes that we had in the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the budget forecasts are very achievable. It is not surprising that they would be because the conditions for business investment in this country are immensely favourable. Just have a look at all the favourable factors for investment. We are looking at rapidly reducing levels of excess capacity. Therefore, business has to invest in order to be able to meet oncoming demand. Demand is increasing quite strongly domestically, as we all know, and the world recovery is picking up pace. We are seeing rising commodity prices, so there is more incentive to invest in the mining industry. There are high levels of profitability across industry generally. There is low inflation and low expectations of future inflation, which is very important for investment. There are low interest rates, considerably reduced levels of business indebtedness, high levels of business confidence and very substantial tax incentives. With all of that going for it, why would business not be getting into investment in a big way? That is what today's figures show will be the outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I ask the House to note exactly how that compares with what the opposition has been saying is the picture for business investment. Throughout June, the shadow Treasurer said at various times, `Business investment is dead in the water'; `There has simply been no recovery in investment in Australia'; `Business investment is being hamstrung'; and `Business investment is still dragging the chain.' Business investment is none of those things. Business investment is taking off and it is going to reach the budget forecasts in 1994-95.</PARA>

Has the minister seen the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 22 August which claims that Australia is missing out on significant housing export opportunities to Japan? What is the government doing to ensure the Australian housing industry captures a share of the thriving Asia-Pacific market?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="389" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BATMAN" MINISTERIAL="HOUSING AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did see the article that the honourable member referred to, which concerned the potential for housing industry access in Japan that would amount to of the order of $10 billion. That is a very substantial market. Kenichi Ohmae, the representative of McKinseys who made that remark, is a commentator that we ought to take seriously. Mr Ohmae was referring to a potential that so far the Australian housing industry has not been able to take up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is&mdash;as the honourable member for Corio suggests&mdash;of some importance that the housing industry recognises not only the quite significant challenge but also the opportunity that the Japanese market represents. Japan alone builds around 1.5 million housing units each year, which is about 10 times the size of the Australian market. Even if we secured only one per cent of the market, it would be worth $2 billion to the industry. So it is very important that we take up this opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is pursuing an urban exports strategy which involves a concerted effort between companies, combined with whatever assistance the government can offer. We are already beginning to see some of the fruits of that strategy. For example, when I was in Shanghai a few weeks ago, I was present at a training course being developed by Fletcher Construction which, together with CSR and Australian Construction Services, is beginning a very significant effort to train people involved in the housing and building industry in China. Just a few moments ago I met a delegation from China, which followed a visit I made there. Members of the delegation are already following up a construction agreement which we have signed with China and are looking at opportunities for Australian involvement, particularly in urban design and planning and forms of urban development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government through Austrade is seeking to coordinate the development of the prefabricated kit homes industry in Japan. I believe there is very considerable potential for that initiative. When I attended a forum in Jakarta, I foreshadowed the possibility of a housing and urban development agreement. We progressed this agreement at the forum and, hopefully, will sign it next month. While in Jakarta I visited the site of a major 30-floor office tower development&mdash;an international hotel with high density apartments, a $500 million project in the centre of Jakarta.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opportunities that Mr Ohmae referred to are not insignificant. At a time when the housing industry is coming off the high levels of activity to around 150,000 units a year, it is important to recognise that many times the Australian production could be available as exports in our region if the industry were able to get itself together and develop a strategy which would be supported by the government to seek to penetrate that region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the honourable member for his question; it is a very important question. The housing industry is one of Australia's most important industries. It has been a very domestic industry, and it could be a very strong international industry. Mr Ohmae's comments signify a direction in which Australians certainly should seek to see their housing industry move in the future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been various concerns expressed by some of the parties affected by the Native Title Act, but I believe that the operation of the act, the way the legislation has established the institutions within the act and also the administration of it with Justice French will show over time&mdash;and I think the act deserves time&mdash;that these fears will not be well founded and that, by and large, the act will work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act is a landmark piece of legislation. It is a Commonwealth act but a national piece of legislation which leaves to the cooperating states the establishment of their own tribunals, the operation of their own policies, a state ministerial override on development, no reservation of minerals to the crown and no overriding right of veto to development in the hands of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Therefore, there is no reason why states should not adopt the act. Those who pander to states rights in this matter, overlooking the express power given to the Commonwealth in the 1967 referendum and a High Court decision in respect of native title, are doing so only to handle and to buttress the rednecks around this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say for the first time on the public record that I was appalled by the Leader of the Opposition's utterances in the break on this matter. He said that he would, if necessary, overturn the legislation. To what? To give it back to Richard Court so he could basically swipe the land from Aboriginal people. After the kerfuffle stopped, about 10 days later, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition confirmed the policy. He said, `There would then be the opportunity for the states, if they so wish, to set up their own mechanisms for dealing with it.' In other words, those opposite would repeal the Native Title Act and go back to state legislation. They would let the states do as they wish, despite the fact that cooperating states now can establish their own tribunals, they can keep their own register of these titles, a state ministerial override on development exists in the legislation and there is no reservation of minerals.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4I4">Mr LEO McLEAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Can the minister advise the House on plans for the future of Australia's telecommunications industry and how any review of the industry may affect users of telecommunications services?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="394" SPEAKER="Lee The Hon M.J." NAMEID="MG4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="DOBELL" MINISTERIAL="COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS; TOURISM" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier this year, the government reaffirmed its decision to introduce greater competition in telecommunications. Since the Labor government ended the monopoly in communications in 1990, consumers have already started to receive the benefits of lower prices. There has been greater investment in infrastructure and a much wider range of services and products available to consumers. They are all good things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has reaffirmed that the duopoly which is enjoyed by Telecom and Optus will end on 1 July 1997. At that time, Australia will start to move towards full and open competition. This competition will be introduced by a Labor government. Previous Liberal and National party governments were happy to sit back and allow a monopoly in communications to continue forever and ever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To help us move towards full and open competition after 1997, I have established a telecommunications advisory panel to provide advice to the government as part of a wider review of this area. The first meeting of that panel will be held in Sydney tomorrow. Members of the panel will include consumers and representatives from Telecom, Optus, Vodaphone, equipment manufacturers, Austel, TPC and many others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The panel will be discussing an issues paper, which I intend to release in the next few weeks. The issues paper will raise a number of very important questions, such as what selection or entry criteria should apply to new entrants in communications in Australia; should there continue to be an industry specific regulator with the powers and responsibilities that Austel currently has; and how we can ensure that here in Australia telecommunications continue to remain accessible and affordable for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can give all honourable members two assurances: first, the government remains fully committed to ensuring that households will continue to have access to untimed local calls; second, we will continue to have full public ownership in Telecom. Just as the Tories in Britain want to privatise British Post and the Royal Mail, the conservatives in Australia are saying their policy is to privatise Telecom. It is very clear that more important than ownership is the competitive regime, the competitive market. In Australia Optus has a greater share after two years than Mercury, the new entrant in Britain, has after 10 years despite the fact that British Telecom has been privatised. So in Australia the consumers, particularly residential consumers, are getting the benefits of greater competition more quickly than is the case in Britain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just look at some of the crazy comments made by the shadow minister for communications, Senator Alston, when advocating the privatisation of Telecom:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You would probably find a scaling down of the work force and you would also find, I think, a lot more realisation that the bottom line is what counts.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the view of the shadow minister: the bottom line is what counts. It will not just be jobs at risk if the opposition has its way. How can the opposition guarantee that a privatised Telecom, where the bottom line is all that counts, can continue to provide the option to consumers of untimed calls? How can a Telecom privatised by the opposition, where the bottom line is all that counts, guarantee it will continue to provide discounts and concessions to the elderly and people with disabilities? There can be no such guarantees. The opposition also cannot guarantee that the Telecom privatised by it, where the bottom line is all that counts, will continue to provide access and affordable prices especially to Australians in rural and provincial areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for those reasons that the government remains committed to full public ownership of Telecom. We are going to ensure that in the 1997 review we will be introducing greater competition. It has been the Labor government that has been responsible for the lower prices, the greater investment and the wider choice, and it will continue to be.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="396" SPEAKER="Kerr The Hon D.J.C." NAMEID="RH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="DENISON" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RH4">Mr KERR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased that the member for Lyons has raised this question, because Australia does have a first-class group of musicians, writers, artists and people responsible for making computer programs whose work not only is important in terms of establishing Australia's national identity both at home and abroad but also is increasingly earning Australia very substantial export earnings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of that agreement, the last Uruguay Round implemented an agreement called the trade related aspects of intellectual property rights agreement, or what we commonly call the TRIPS agreement. Along with other reforms which are currently being implemented, it will give creators and investors a much more secure and confident basis for their investment and the future of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the principal beneficiaries in this area arising from the TRIPS agreement is the music industry. Australia is the third largest English language producer nation of music recordings in the world. After TRIPS is implemented, Australia will have a much more secure capacity to market that product internationally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under TRIPS there are three principal new additions which we will be legislating in this country. They will be reciprocal. Firstly, copyright owners will be able to decide whether and under what conditions copyright material will be subject to rental. At present, particularly in the CD area, those copyright owners have no commercial control in relation to rental. Whilst that activity has been quite legal, it has been of great concern to copyright owners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, TRIPS will do a lot to improve the control of pirating of copyright material. Pirating of copyright material is a billion dollar industry overseas. There is no worse let-down and discouragement to artists&mdash;those who make a creative effort&mdash;and those who invest in it, than to see their work being ripped off and taken advantage of unfairly. The arrangements that will be made under TRIPS will make it harder for those abuses to occur, and there are new arrangements for the intercepting of pirate copies, such as tougher enforcement of procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia we will also be taking action to close loopholes that have permitted unauthorised production of recordings, which has been causing considerable concern to those in the music industry. We have seen a rash of those unauthorised recordings in Australia. Under TRIPS our action will be responded to reciprocally so that our investors and those in the music industry will have a securer market, both locally and overseas. Implementation of these changes is very important for Australia. It will deliver substantially wider international protection that is consistent with our policy on our cultural industries. I believe that it is very important for us in terms of building an export orientated and prosperous Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;It is most appropriate that representatives of the South Sea Islander community should be present. It gives me great pleasure today to table the government's response to a Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The call for recognition</EMPHASIS>. Tabled on 6 May 1993, this is a report on the situation and needs of Australian South Sea Islanders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report's title encapsulates the most fundamental issue for Australian South Sea Islanders; that is, to be recognised. It is a major step in addressing a serious wrong. In the formal statement I am tabling today, the Commonwealth government recognises Australian born South Sea Islanders as a distinct ethnic group in Australia with its own history and culture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report concludes that Australian South Sea Islanders are a unique minority group and have been severely disadvantaged through racial discrimination. Yet until now they have not even been formally recognised as a distinct ethnic group in Australia. In other words, they have not existed officially. Perhaps this is the greatest insult that can be paid to any ethnic group. More than an insult, this deflates a community's self-esteem. It also threatens the collective heritage of Australian born South Sea Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people have a right to a fair go as much as any other Australians. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The call for recognition</EMPHASIS> vindicates the government's concern for issues raised by such people as Faith Bandler in her book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wacvie</EMPHASIS>. Published in 1977, the book tells the moving story of Ms Bandler's father. He was taken by force from the island of Ambryn, which is part of Vanuatu, and put to work on the cane fields of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to spend a few moments detailing the history of Australian South Sea Islanders. It is a history that, regrettably, few Australians are familiar with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">South Sea Islanders are the descendants of the 55,000 to 60,000 Melanesians brought to Queensland between 1863 and 1904 to develop the local sugar industry. They came from many Pacific islands&mdash;mainly from Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands. Like Faith Bandler's father, they were often brought against their will. In other words, they were treated no better than slaves. That is the ugly truth of the matter. This sorry chapter in Australian history was referred to as blackbirding, which is of itself an obnoxious term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No other group came to Australia with less status than did the South Sea Islanders. To add insult to injury, between 1904 and 1906, many were deported under the white Australia policy. This policy was implemented as one of the first acts of the newly formed Commonwealth of Australia. However, about 2,400 people either evaded deportation or were exempted from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's Australian South Sea Islanders are the descendants of this remnant community. We are not completely certain how many members make up the community, but the report suggests that there are 15,000 to 20,000 Australian South Sea Islanders. Many still live on the Queensland and northern New South Wales coast, where their forebears sweated and strained to develop Australia's sugar industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite having been in Australia since before Federation, South Sea Islanders have had very little written about their situation. In 1991, the Evatt Foundation directed the attention of the government to the social and economic disadvantage facing many Australian South Sea Islanders. As a consequence my predecessor, the then Attorney-General, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), asked the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to undertake an inquiry into their situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already mentioned, the report prepared by the commission as a result of this inquiry was tabled in May last year. The brief history of Australian South Sea Islanders I have just described is drawn largely from that report. A lengthy process of consultations with relevant Commonwealth departments and agencies has been undertaken since the tabling of the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to announce that the government response which I am tabling today proposes a number of positive initiatives. The government's response is designed to foster a real sense of community amongst Australian South Sea Islanders. The report acknowledges that Australian South Sea Islanders feel they will not become part of multicultural Australia until they are properly acknowledged with their own special heritage and cultural traditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government fully supports the report's first recommendation, which calls for the government's formal recognition of Australian South Sea Islanders as a unique minority group that is severely disadvantaged through racial discrimination. This government acknowledges that the descendants of Pacific labourers see themselves as quite distinct from other ethnic minorities in Australia. They are not indigenous, nor are they descended from mainstream settler migrants. Their historical experience in Australia has generally been one of a lack of control over their own affairs and of exclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the formal statement I am tabling today the government acknowledges the injustices of the indentured system of labour under which the ancestors of Australian South Sea Islanders were brought to Australia and the economic and cultural dislocation suffered by those South Sea Islanders and their descendants, the severe disadvantage experienced by South Sea Islanders and their descendants, and their contribution to the culture, history and economy of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's response to the other five recommendations is set out in detail in the formal response. Briefly, the initiatives we are proposing are based on the recognition of the group as an entity. The census provided by the report is a good start. We need to assess how government is servicing the needs of the community. First of all, we have named the Australian South Sea Islanders as an access and equity group. This means that all Commonwealth government agencies must include service statistics in their reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are funding two liaison officers for three years to provide the community with organisational support. We have also decided to commission a small cross-portfolio research project to gather data on Australian South Sea Islanders, which should ultimately help service delivery agencies in identifying the community needs. I am seeking to have an Australian non-government organisation take up this research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, government agencies should take steps to increase public awareness of South Sea Islanders and their role in Australia's history. My colleague the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) has earlier today announced details of initiatives that are outlined in the government response. These directly address some of the needs identified in this recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When my predecessor asked the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to conduct an inquiry into the situation of Australian South Sea Islanders, it was an important first step in the process of recognising their existence and examining their special needs. This initiative demonstrates the Commonwealth government's commitment to making social justice a reality for all Australians. It is also about all Australians celebrating their particular heritage and having their contribution to this country recognised. I would like to think that the steps the government is taking mark a new chapter in the history of Australian South Sea Islanders. Mr Deputy Speaker, I table the government's response to this important report. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Attorney-General quite rightly observed, the South Sea Islander Australians have been recognised as neither an indigenous nor an officially recognised ethnic group. To that extent, they have been sidelined from the great mass of Australians. The injustice perpetrated against this group in the 19th century stands to our enduring shame. They were used, exploited and then returned or, for those who stayed behind, abandoned&mdash;but in a way that is only exceeded in its injustice by decades of studious indifference and neglect in the 20th century. One has only to read speeches to this parliament by the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) or to read Noel Fatnowna's book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fragments of a Lost Heritage</EMPHASIS>&mdash;again, often referred to by the honourable member for Dawson&mdash;to know just how unjust and demoralising their existence has been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of World War II and its aftermath shows how debilitating deprivation from one's cultural background can be. Our multicultural policy in Australia has sought to rectify that situation for a broad raft of ethnic groups. Yet a group which has been with us&mdash;and no longer as indentured labour&mdash;in some instances for nearly 150 years has been studiously ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure I speak for those along the Queensland and New South Wales coastal regions, and indeed for those in capital cities, in welcoming the Attorney-General's formal statement regarding South Sea Islanders. For the first time there is formal recognition by this parliament of the economic and cultural dislocation these people suffered, the disadvantage experienced by their descendants and the acknowledgment of their cultural history and their place in the economy of Australia. This has long been awaited and indeed it has been demanded by the damning report of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Now that it is on the record, and if it is genuinely going to mean anything, this must be more than rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier today, the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) announced four cultural programs to create an awareness of and a cultural surround to the South Sea Islander people. One of them will be a South Sea Islander cultural awareness awards scheme which will allow up to six of their number to visit their home islands and home countries in the South Pacific to re-establish cultural and family links. It will also involve a curriculum project, funded by AIDAB and the Queensland education department collectively, to bring about a two-year $150,000 program on the history and culture of South Sea Islander people. This will be tested initially in Queensland schools. There will be a South Sea Islander historical exhibition of photographs and artefacts, which in many instances will not have been seen before, which will tour the museums of Australia and a limited number of country centres before touring the South Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The project that is of particular interest to me, because it is in the electorate of Hinkler, is the Bundaberg historical building project. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Office of Multicultural Affairs and the Queensland government have undertaken to restore two small wooden buildings at Fairymead, adjacent to the Fairymead mill, where many South Sea Islanders were indentured labour. These rather humble buildings are a representation of the new culture of the South Sea Islander people. It was in and around these buildings that the South Sea Islander evangelical church was formed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You, Mr Deputy Speaker, were in the chair on the day on which I reported to the parliament on a very moving event which happened in Bundaberg on the afternoon of Friday, 6 May when some 500 residents of Bundaberg and 150 South Sea Islander residents of the Solomon Islands flew into Bundaberg for a religious celebration and what was an unsolicited act of reconciliation. You will further recall that that group, through their Minister for Home Affairs, the Hon. Michael Maeliau, presented to this parliament a symbolic war club with the wish that never again would there be any disharmony between the South Sea Islander people and the Australian people. That was a very generous act of reconciliation. As I said, it was totally unsolicited, totally uncalled for and totally unplanned, and it came from their hearts. It is fitting that today in this parliament we should reciprocate by putting on the record our acknowledgment of the injustices perpetrated on these people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement made by the minister announces three initiatives. First, Australian South Sea Islanders will be declared an access and equity group. This means that, in future, all government departments and agencies will include them in statistical analyses and reports, which will certainly provide some form of database. Second, the government will fund two liaison officers for three years, at a total cost of $80,000. Third, the government also announced that $50,000 will be provided for a small cross-portfolio research project. This is a restatement of the minister's press release of 26 July. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I do not wish in any way to be churlish, and while I readily acknowledge the generosity of many of the moves that have been undertaken today, those last three initiatives are generally small bickies. I do not criticise them, but I hope that they are no more than the first faltering steps towards some genuine recognition. It should be abundantly clear to government departments that these people have been outrageously neglected in the areas of housing, education, health and training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would hate to think that the announcement of building up databases, providing two liaison offices for 20,000 people and $50,000 for a cross-portfolio research project would be the end of the affair. As I said, I hope this will be just the start and that it, very quickly, rights some of the social and economic injustices that have been perpetrated by studious indifference over the last 90 years or so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today is a great day of celebration for the South Sea Islander people. They have seen their culture recognised by the minister at a midday function. In some ways it is an embarrassing day for Australians to have to admit past wrongs, but it is something that had to be done and something we must do with all due humility. It is a day to acknowledge the first faltering steps towards greater social and economic justice for the South Sea Islander residents of this country. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also pay tribute to the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), who has been assiduous in pursuing the position of South Sea Islander people. He comes from Mackay, where there is a very large number of South Sea Islander descendants. I supported a motion that he put forward on 30 September last year, seeking the government to take the action that it has taken today. He and I later participated in a deputation to the Attorney-General, who was pleased to see us. We had very full and detailed discussion about the needs of South Sea Islander people. One of the good things about this parliament is that we can have bipartisanship in many areas, particularly in this area. With the support of the opposition, the government will undertake action which will go part of the way to remedy the disgraceful treatment of a great many wonderful Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement about wonderful Australians is not a general statement. I speak from experience. When I spoke last September I mentioned a wonderful and great man, Noel Fatnowna, whom I had the great privilege of meeting and knowing. I am also privileged that one of his nephews, Garth Fatnowna, is a teacher at a primary school in my electorate and is doing a wonderful job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, and again, this is one of the highlights of this sitting because the government is moving the way the opposition and the South Sea Islander descendants want it to move. It is really a first-rate effort. Again, I can only say congratulations. We look forward to continuing to work with this government and the next government&mdash;which will be us, of course&mdash;in furthering the position of South Sea Islanders. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The events of the last few days have been very instructive as to how the ALP is managed. The public, I am sure all honourable members on both sides would agree, has gained something of a rare insight into the brutal, grubby and thuggish world of factional politics in which the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) claimed, quite rightly&mdash;and not surprisingly, to us at least&mdash;that power in Victoria in the Labor Party resides within the hands of only two individuals: Senator Robert Ray of the Right and Senator Carr of the Left.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What sort of self-respecting member of parliament would allow his or her future to be determined by two single representatives of the party that member swears allegiance to? Collectively, how can those opposite surrender the fortunes of the Labor Party, an historical and major player in Australian political history, to a handful of individuals in each of the different states representing the different factions? We can say this with certainty though: the honourable member for Lalor was not one of them. The member for Lalor stood his ground and refused to bow to the heavy-handed tactics of the factional leaders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is very relevant to the matter of public importance because, just as factional politics determine party affairs, they also determine government policy. We might stand bemused by the intrigue surrounding factional politics within a Labor Party context but, when it comes to deciding government policy according to factional wants, needs, prejudices and ideological obsessions, it is a different thing altogether because any government should govern purely on the basis of the national interest. We have seen none of that in regard to uranium policy where two of the three factions in existence that we know, namely, the Centre Left and the right wing faction&mdash;leaving aside the loose collection of Independents&mdash;have opposed the government's current restrictive three-mine uranium policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that because senior representatives of both those factions have gone public and described the uranium policy of the government as illogical, absurd and a joke. These senior representatives are: Senator Robert Ray, one of the executioners in the case of the honourable member for Lalor; Senator Loosley from the right wing; Senator Collins, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy; the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) from the Centre Left; the Special Minister of State (Mr Johns)&mdash;I presume he belongs to the Centre Left; we are never quite sure where his ambitions are best suited&mdash;and Senator Beahan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor Party icons such as Peter Walsh, John Button, Graham Richardson and&mdash;dare I say&mdash;Bob Hawke have reiterated in recent days that the Labor Party's three-mine policy makes no sense. It is an absurdity but, more than that, it is an absurdity that is costing this country dearly, to the tune of $260 million a year in lost income and the drying up of new investment. Those figures were supplied by one of the government's foremost economic forecasting agencies, ABARE, in January this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had a little more exposure to the honourable member for Lalor than most, having shadowed him in the portfolio of science and technology for two years. He can be irritatingly superior, verbose, condescending and naive. However, to give him his due, he fought off, at least for the moment, the factional pressure placed upon him. In any event, those characteristics can easily apply to the man who sought to replace him, namely, Senator Gareth Evans, who is arrogant and so out of touch, so completely removed, from the ordinary life and aspirations of Australians. He is not interested in the seat of Holt because it is centred on Dandenong, which he regards as too far from the airport. Dandenong is a 50-minute drive from the airport. A large number of honourable members on my side, and on the government side, live several hours from the airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just the distance of safe seats which precludes Senator Evans from seeking preselection; he cannot have a seat with a four or five per cent majority either because he will never be there. It is an admission that he will never live in the electorate; moreover, he will never visit it. He does not want a safe seat because it is too far from the airport. He does not want a relatively safe seat because he will then have to visit it. Factional politics are destroying a window of opportunity for the uranium export industry in Australia. Bear in mind that whatever the members of the left wing try to cloud the issue with&mdash;nuclear enrichment, nuclear weaponry&mdash;the fact is that, purely and simply, the debate is about the export of uranium oxide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ABARE released its report in January this year. It found that the spot price for uranium contracts would double over the rest of the decade, rising from around $US8 per pound to around $US18 to $US20 per pound. It concluded that inventories held by overseas utilities are running down rapidly and the consumption of uranium oxide has been running at twice the rate of production. That means that Australia's low cost producers have the best opportunity yet to grab a bigger share of the increasingly lucrative market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the government's restrictive policy, we have only two mines. It is a fallacy to call it a three-mine policy because Nabarlek, one of the three mines in addition to Ranger and Roxby Downs, ceased production in 1990. Consequently, those two mines are providing only 10 per cent of the world demand whilst we have 30 per cent of the reserves. As honourable members on this side at least are only too well aware, the opposite is entirely the case in Canada: it supplies 30 per cent of world demand, yet has only 10 per cent of the reserves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, it is an inescapable fact that we are exporting jobs to Canada. The Canadian companies and the government have all their intelligence agents at the Labor Party biennial conference trying to see whether there is any way they can obtain inside information, perhaps even&mdash;dare I say it&mdash;influence delegates. They want no change in the policy&mdash;no change whatsoever&mdash;because it benefits Canada enormously, to the tune, as I say, of some $260 million a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are no economic arguments against abolishing the government's three-mine policy. Honourable members will have noticed in recent months that spokespeople on behalf of the left wing, such as the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh), the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) and others, have made no attempt to justify the maintenance of the restrictive three-mine policy on any logical, rational grounds. They simply say that it is better than having a non-restrictive policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They say that there is no difference in the morality of uranium oxide extracted in South Australia and the Northern Territory from that which may be in the Kintyre mine in Western Australia. They are not so stupid as to maintain that argument as they did during the 1980s; rather they fall back to the totally irresponsible argument that that is the best that can be achieved in the present circumstances and, in that case, it is best to maintain the three-mine policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that there is no member from the Left here today to participate in this debate. We have two members of the right wing faction. Is it not somewhat ironic? Both the people who were going to speak today, the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) and the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Horne) unambiguously support the abolition of the three-mine policy. Where is the courage of the left wing? Where is the commitment of their convictions? What it boils down to is that these two members who are carrying the can for the left wing are too scared to be in the chamber. Neither of them believes a single word he is going to say. We know that from their private as well as their not so private declarations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Rankin, the Minister for Resources, knows all about factional politics&mdash;because guess who is interested in his seat? Suddenly, after the redistribution in Queensland there are quite a few eyeing his seat, not least of all Kevin Rudd, who is the director of cabinet and a Labor Party apparatchik in Queensland. Now that the seat of the member for Forde (Ms Crawford) is so marginal, he is going for the seat of Rankin. So factional politics dictate every aspect of their individual careers as members of parliament and government policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us turn to the environment argument, the biggest furphy ever put up against uranium mining in Australia. This one is easy to answer. I simply refer honourable members to an answer that the then Minister for Resources gave to me in questions on notice dated 13 December 1993&mdash;quite recently. I asked him whether his attention had ever been drawn to any significant environmental problems with either Roxby Downs or Ranger uranium. In regard to the Ranger uranium mine his answer was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not aware of any serious occupational health and safety concerns arising from uranium mining operations.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to give the mine a clean bill of health in regard to the environment. The exact same words were employed by the minister in writing in regard to Olympic Dam. No wonder. Ranger uranium mine has won a string of environmental awards in a national competition across the mining industry. What the left wing tried to do in desperation, having no economically or environmentally justifiable arguments against uranium, is to say that the future market prospects for uranium are pessimistic and therefore there is no point in allowing greater mining of uranium. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already cited the ABARE report, but leave that aside. Why is it the role of government to make decisions on the basis of the national interest governed by the commercial prospects of one company or another? It is not. Let the market decide. If I were a shareholder of one of the existing prospective mining companies, I know whose judgment I would rely on. It would not be one of the left wing members who, ironically, have the same abhorrence of the marketplace as they do of uranium mining. I would much prefer to rely on the commercial assessments of the companies involved. So, even if left wing members persist with an economic argument, they miss the obvious point. Government policy should not&mdash;with this government there are some exceptions&mdash;be based on the commercial judgments of companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appals me that the interests of local Aboriginal communities is totally discarded by such self-appointed champions of Aboriginal people as the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner). We saw that from his answer in question time. He was asked whether he was aware that local Aboriginal communities have derived the benefit of some $240 million in royalties from the Ranger uranium mine over the last 12 years. I doubt whether he was aware. He was then asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On what basis can the left wing deny the same rights for economic and social independence to the traditional landholders around the proposed Koongarra mine in the Northern Territory?</PARA>
<PARA>He walked away from it. It is the same with the Minister for Consumer Affairs. They blandly declare it is not an Aboriginal affairs issue. Of course it is. The Northern Lands Council has declared that those people want mining to go ahead, and that has to be a prime consideration. On no grounds can the Minister for Resources, who is at the table, or any of the absent left wing members and ministers who are dictating the terms of this debate and distorting Australia's economic performance as a result put up any logical, rational arguments against abolition of the three-mine policy. The right wing and the Centre Left should have the courage of their convictions and finally, once and for all, allow majority rule to apply to the Labor Party as it does to the community at large. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the member knows, it is not my ministerial responsibility, but I have overall responsibility for answering the issue in this House. Everyone will have read the comments attributed to different people and interest groups about the uranium mining. It now remains for the Australian Labor Party, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said at question time, to decide whether we endorse the current policy or change it at the national conference in September. Any change to the policy to add a new development will be a matter for the government following any consideration at the Labor Party's national conference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, what we have here is an exercise by the National Party to lobby on behalf of the uranium industry. The poor old National Party is going to be a lobby group. That is fine. But once it used to be a great political party. No more. The proponents for any change claim, as many members have, that there is a market window of opportunity around 1997 when surplus inventories must be deleted. Others have claimed that there will be a substantial requirement for new mining by the turn of the century as older mines are closed and the Commonwealth of Independent States material and de-enriched uranium might not be available in sufficient quantity to make up the difference between demand and production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have seen industry claim that 14,000 tonnes of yellow cake from new mines will be required by the year 2000, the equivalent to nearly five new mines of the size of the present Ranger operation. Let us at this point go back in the debate, back in history a little. In 1983 the government decided to allow export from three mines: Ranger, Nabarlek and Olympic Dam. This policy the government has is a 10-year-old policy; it is not new. But we are coming to a conference, so it is a matter of debate. As we all know, since then Nabarlek has ceased production and we export only from Ranger in the Northern Territory and Olympic Dam in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the honourable member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) is about to follow in this debate. I do not know whether he really wants more mines because the size of the deposits at Olympic Dam are enough to fill as much demand as we could possibly have. Our uranium is bought by a large range of countries. It is important that we realise which those countries are. They are Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Finland, France, Germany, Spain, Belgium and the United States of America. On figures I have seen, over the past 10 years we have exported around 42,000 tonnes of uranium oxide and earned less than $200 million a year over the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us see where uranium sits in the resources sector as a whole. Without a doubt the resources sector is the backbone of the Australian economy. In total, the resources sector contributes 6.4 per cent of total GDP. Resource exports in 1992-93 totalled some $30.6 billion and uranium exports were around $200 million. Resource exports are about 61 per cent of all our commodity exports. They bring in amounts equal to 40 per cent of our goods and services exports. In addition, over $8 billion of Australia's manufactured exports, including manufactured metal products, cars, machinery, chemicals, paints and plastics, are dependent on minerals and energy inputs. ABARE estimates that resource exports will increase to $32 billion this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The resource sector directly employs around 158,000 people&mdash;2.1 per cent of employment&mdash;and pays about $6 billion in wages and salaries. As well, 400,000 manufacturing industry jobs&mdash;that is around 5 1/2 per cent of total employment and about $12 billion in wages and salaries&mdash;are dependent on Australia's minerals and energy inputs. Any increase in demand for uranium will not necessarily lead to increased employment. For example, uranium mining is, as we know, basically a by-product of Olympic Dam. It is incremental to the main game there which is copper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About 26 per cent of new capital expenditure, or $7.2 billion, is based in the resources sector. Over $1 billion is forecast by ABARE to be spent on private exploration in 1993-94. On top of that, the sector pays around $2 1/2 billion in royalties to state, territory and Commonwealth governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The resources sector is strongly export orientated. Australia is the world's largest supplier of black coal, alumina, diamonds and mineral sand products. It is the second largest exporter of iron ore, aluminium, lead and zinc and the third largest supplier of the world's gold. Two-thirds of all our resource exports by value go to the Asia region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of major developments in the pipeline which it is important to put in context in view of what the shadow minister, the honourable member for Gippsland, has said about the lack of investment in the uranium industry. Century Zinc in Queensland has the potential to produce 10 per cent of the world's zinc. This is a $750 million investment and first production is expected in late 1997 or early 1998. McArthur River in the Northern Territory has an expected annual production of 350 tonnes of zinc, lead and silver concentrates. The first stage is a $220 million investment and first production is expected in May 1994. The Marandoo iron ore mine in Western Australia is proceeding ahead of schedule and below budget. This is a $360 million investment with first production expected later this year. What is more, this export orientation is sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any upsurge in demand for uranium does not necessarily mean new mines will be opened. Existing mines like Olympic Dam have a cost advantage because of the infrastructure in place. Apart from uranium&mdash;I acknowledge, as the shadow minister said, that we have in Australia a very large proportion of the world's resources&mdash;Australia has 20 per cent of the world's economically recoverable resources of bauxite, iron ore, mineral sands, industrial diamonds and tantalum. We have over 10 per cent of the world's brown coal, lead, manganese, cadmium and zinc and we have over five per cent of the world's black coal, silver, nickel, lithium and gold. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What I am trying to do is to address the point made by the shadow minister in his contribution that this was crucial to the Australian resources sector. What I am showing here is that there are many issues that are crucial to the resources sector&mdash;not just the issue of uranium. For an industry as large as this, we should be looking to a bipartisan policy and not trying to score cheap political points, which is what I think the member for Gippsland is doing in this uranium debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the shadow minister is talking about uranium being a huge opportunity lost, it is important to keep this in perspective. That is what I have been trying to do in this debate. The shadow minister knows as well as I do that the market for uranium has been depressed. He has quoted details of how this will recover before the end of the decade. Some uncertainties still remain about the projected growth. In particular, uncertainties exist about the level of exports from the Commonwealth of Independent States and what the real market impact will be of diluted ex-weapons highly enriched uranium. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present the spot price is about $US9.40 a pound for uranium oxide. Despite some firming from $US9.25 over recent weeks, the price is still well below production costs for even the lowest cost mines such as Ranger and Olympic Dam. The current price, as the shadow minister knows, is well below the cost of production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Long-term contract prices may vary from spot prices in particular markets, but the advice I have is that with a few exceptions&mdash;Japan and France&mdash;long-term prices are becoming more aligned with spot levels. This is forcing more mines to close&mdash;not open&mdash;or to reduce their production if they remain open. It is the overhang of inventories that has been depressing prices for the last 15 years or so, and Australia has been part of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again I will give the member for Gippsland a little lesson in history. Our stockpile originally came from Rum Jungle about 25 years ago and was about 2,000 tonnes. This stockpile was loaned to Queensland Mines and Ranger and repaid in kind. I recall that my colleague the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) advised that the last of the stockpile had been sold to North American electricity producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also point out that predictions of a turnaround in the uranium market are not new. Earlier predictions were made before the end of the Cold War and before the entry onto the market of cheap Commonwealth of Independent States exports. However, the legacy of the Cold War will continue to provide some uncertainty about the timing of a turnaround. I also recall that we are not yet producing at full capacity in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look more closely at what the opposition has been saying. The basic point seems to be that we are missing out on a bigger share of an increasingly lucrative export market and that is a disaster for the Australian economy. I want to hark back to what I said earlier about the shadow minister concentrating on the small things and missing out on the larger picture. He focuses too much on trying to score points and not on the real issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot wait to see what comes out of the opposition's new directions policy next month in relation to the resources sector. I have had a look back to see what the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) has had to say about the resources sector in the 10 years that he has been a member of this House. I must say that the only notable thing I could find was the comment that he thought the mining industry was `weak and gutless'&mdash;hardly a fitting comment for our major export sector. It is not only the government that is waiting for the opposition's new directions. The whole of the Australian resources sector is waiting to see what the new direction is. Perhaps we will find a new direction on the native title legislation, on which even the shadow minister concedes the opposition got it wrong last year with respect to the resources sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the four years that I have been a minister, I have yet to see an alternative policy put forward by any of my shadow ministers. When I was minister for small business, the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) was flat out finding a question to ask me, let alone finding an alternative policy. The only thing he came up with in those days was the GST. Similarly in the resources sector, I wait with bated breath to see the major contribution that the member for Gippsland will make to future directions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has provided the sorts of conditions in which the Australian resources industry can grow. Industrial harmony, low inflation and low interest rates have been key elements. We have shown that we can manage at the macro-economic level and at the industry level. We have shown what we can do for the very important coal industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it quite extraordinary that on the second day of a new sitting the Labor Party's three mines policy is considered the most important issue. I would have thought, with the upheaval that we are facing in the coal industry, that perhaps that would have been a bigger issue for debate, and a real issue of substance, than this nonsense and apologetic approach on behalf of the resources sector. I ask the member for Gippsland whether, when he went to Korea and Japan, he met with the major purchasers of our resources, as I did, and gave them the message that I gave them on price and investment for the future. I ask the honourable member for Gippsland not to talk to me about working to expand our exports and wealth but to get on with the job of supporting the government on what should be a bipartisan policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Gippsland recently asked me about reforming the Coal Industry Tribunal. Here we are: mea culpa.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite also want to cut the diesel fuel excise for rail use. Why would we want to discriminate against rail users other than coal? It could also be at variance with our international obligations. I note that most of the coal lines in Queensland use electric trains, not diesel trains. So the policy is a bit outdated. It certainly would not cost much. Those opposite also want to abolish export controls.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answer to a question in question time, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) ducked and weaved. He just refused to answer the question, which is understandable when we consider the embarrassing backdowns of the factions over the last two or three days due to the controversy surrounding the President of the Australian Labor Party, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones). The government's policy stands in stark contrast to the Hilmer report, which referred to world competition, world best practice and GATT. What we have is a grubby little factional issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister summed it up in question time. He mentioned the electorate of Grey and the Olympic Dam mine. It is true that Olympic Dam is a wonderful mine. The Prime Minister and I concur in that. But the issue is not whether Grey or Olympic Dam get the maximum effect out of that export. The issue is whether Australia gets the maximum effect. The issue is whether we will transfer that production and Australian jobs to Canada. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us dwell on Olympic Dam for a minute. Olympic Dam would never have been in this position if the Labor Party had got its way. The Labor government was clearly opposed to it. It was only due to the great courage of Norman Foster, who crossed the floor to make sure that that bill went through, that the mine went ahead. So let us not talk about the Labor Party's record with respect to Olympic Dam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party's three mines policy is a half-hearted policy because the government cannot make up its mind. The policy says, `Yes, we'll allow uranium mining at Olympic Dam and Ranger. We welcome the export income and jobs that these mines create.' But the policy also says, `We don't want uranium mining; we don't want the extra export income and the extra jobs which further mines could create for Australia.' The Labor Party's three mines policy is so hypocritical and so illogical that even its own members are questioning its worth. They are embarrassed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor adopted the three mines policy in November 1983 and, despite concerted efforts from various groups in Australia, Labor has stuck with that policy. Mind you, the 1983 vote was 55 to 46 in favour of restricting the number of mines to three. The Prime Minister stated in May 1994 that the policy was Holy Writ, but his response today surely indicates his lack of enthusiasm for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the poor member for Lalor. What a week he has had! But he has come through with flying colours. He believed that there was room for one more mine to open because Nabarlek had been mined out. In July 1994, he said, `If we stick to the three mines policy, there is still an opportunity for another mine to come in.' The member was subsequently chastised for his mistake in thinking that the Labor Party would allow a third mine into the three mines policy. He was chastised for thinking that the three mines policy might have some inkling of commonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the ALP is beginning to break ranks on the issue and run to its factionalised corners. But there is no hurry, is there? Labor needs time to debate these things. Labor is no good at making quick business decisions. In fact, it is no good at making business decisions at all. The three mines policy has to be one of the most ridiculous decisions of all time. We will not talk about ANL, Mr Wran and his $3,000 a day, or Mr Turnbull because I would be getting off the topic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are all aware of how illogical the policy is. In reality, the government has a three mines policy, but it wants to stop uranium mining. However, the Labor government has not stopped the mining; it has simply strictly restricted it. It has restricted its profitability, the job opportunities for Australians and Australia's ability to grab a large piece of the world market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister for resources and energy, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), has touched on the issue of Aboriginal communities, and I will just follow up on that. Aboriginal communities have joined the mining industry's call for the ALP to scrap the three mines policy. The Northern Land Council recently voted to support industry calls for further mine development. But this seems to have fallen on deaf ears. While the Labor Party professes to know and want what is best for Aboriginal communities, when these communities call for a chance to create some wealth and independence, the Labor Party cannot budge because of outdated ideology. With this policy, Labor shows that it is prepared to sacrifice jobs and development in favour of minority interest groups and a trepidation of an industry which is growing around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's uranium is exported to Japan, Korea, the UK, the US and several countries in western Europe. Our uranium exports earn Australia roughly $280 million a year. About 15 countries mine uranium, and our share of world production rose from 3.5 per cent in 1980 to 13.2 per cent in 1990. I mentioned the Olympic Dam, which is located near Roxby Downs, and its $1.4 billion investment. But the very special thing about Olympic Dam, which is in my electorate, is the opportunities that it provided for hundreds of people&mdash;probably nearer to thousands of people&mdash;in my region. This is the point that the former Labor member, Norman Foster, made so many years ago when he crossed the floor. </PARA>

I understand that the prospects for the Australian uranium mining industry are reasonably bright, but they could be a lot brighter if only the government would come to the party. As I said, saying no to further uranium mining is saying no to more Australian jobs. </PARA>

Why will Woomera be forced to temporarily store nuclear waste in New South Wales? I will tell honourable members why. The government does not know how to manage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has been aware of a push to remove nuclear waste from Lucas Heights for some time. In fact, it has been fighting and stalling the issues in the courts, yet it has not had time to consult people about a permanent or temporary site for this waste. Can we really believe that the government could not foresee the Lucas Heights situation? As I said in the House last night, this is part of the government's executive style. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor clings to dinosaurs like the three-mine policy, saying it is saving the Australian people from the nuclear terror. At the same time it is carting waste around the country and dumping it into communities without consulting them. Australia's uranium industry has an excellent record of health and safety. I do not think the government can point a finger&mdash;and I do not think the minister does&mdash;or raise questions when it has handled Lucas Heights waste in such a shoddy way, having total disregard for the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, safety is paramount when dealing with uranium and nuclear energy. Uranium's largest application is as a fuel for the production of electricity through nuclear energy. It provides about 15 per cent of the world's electricity. There are a number of bodies which look at safety. For example, we have the Nuclear Safety Bureau, under ANSTO, to monitor and review the safety of nuclear plants in Australia. The industry is subject to codes of practice based on international standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday in the Senate the Australian Democrats moved a motion for the government to maintain its three-mine policy&mdash;this from a party totally opposed to uranium mining.

Let us look at the economic conditions that existed in regard to uranium over the past years, because that has been your short suit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1983 uranium oxide was bringing about $24 a pound; today it is bringing $8 a pound. Today we find that Ranger is operating at about 50 per cent of its capacity and Roxby Downs is producing about 1,500 tonnes per annum with reserves of 360,000 tonnes. Why are they leaving it in the ground? Because they are not being paid for it. They are making a nice profit out of their gold, they are embarrassed by the amount of copper that they are digging up, but they are leaving the uranium in the ground because mining it is not worth while. Why is it not worth while? Because every nuclear warhead that is currently being dismantled produces the equivalent of four tonnes of fuel grade uranium. I suppose now the opposition might say, `Let the world retain a nuclear arsenal so that the price of uranium can be maintained at an artificially high level.'

Obviously there is a lot of uranium in the world, but the world is only producing about 40,000 tonnes a year. The shortfall between current production and current consumption means that if we do not expand production and the consumption increases at about one per cent per annum&mdash;that is projected in the ABARE figures&mdash;then there is enough uranium currently stored to last for another 30 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ranger, which is run by Energy Resources of Australia, is currently producing at about 50 per cent capacity. It was so depressed with the world market two years ago that it was buying uranium offshore and reselling it. It was simply not worth its while to mine its ore body, process it and sell it. It was simply not economically feasible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The members of the opposition claim that they stand for big business. No wonder their leader was called in last week to have a talk with big business so they could find out what makes those opposite tick. They do not tick on economics. Let us look at the magnificent mine in South Australia that we have heard all about. We find that, with a resource of about 360,000 tonnes, it is currently producing about 1,500 tonnes. Why is it not getting stuck into that enormous reserve? Because it does not pay. Instead it is mining its gold and copper because that is where the market is. Fortunately, because of the nature of the ore body, it can selectively choose to mine its gold and copper and leave the uranium in the ground. </PARA>

They know that Australia would immediately have the capacity to produce dramatically more uranium if the market were there. Who would want to for $US8 a pound? No-one.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before question time I was addressing the government's $1,061 million annual assistance program to local government and the failure of that program to allocate grants in a totally equitable fashion. The problem comes from two areas. Firstly, the allocation formulas do not use indices of socioeconomic advantage and disadvantage. They do not take a needs based approach concerning the provision of local government facilities and the capacity of various local government authorities. Use should be made of the 1991 ABS census index of relative socioeconomic disadvantage for each local government area in Australia. I congratulate the ABS on the production of that index because it is a great step forward for more equitable allocations of government resources.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second problem arises from the requirement for 30 per cent of funds to be distributed on a per capita basis. The wealthy councils and local government areas with higher levels of private income receive funding. This results in $200 million, or nearly 19 per cent of federal funding for local government authorities in Australia, being allocated to the most advantaged 22 per cent of municipalities in the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make some comments concerning the allocation of child-care funds. My reference is questions and answers provided in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> concerning the allocation of funding for programs in outside school hours care services, long day care, occasional care and family day care for the 1992-96 national child-care strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The local government areas listed that receive funds offer no surprise when one goes to the answer concerning the funding formulas and the method of allocation. Socioeconomic indicators such as income levels are part of the background information in child-care regional needs analyses considered by the planning committee. However, socioeconomic status is not used in arriving at recommendations on areas to be targeted for new places. Places are allocated according to levels of unmet demand in each area. I am surprised by this. I would have thought that in child-care provision under the allocation of government funds socioeconomic considerations would have been paramount. The government should have consideration for those factors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not all local government areas are the same. In areas with lower levels of private income, there is a greater need for the public provision of child-care services. The use of the ABS index would prove invaluable in making sure that government funds for child care are allocated to where they are needed most. I would urge that upon the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate has raised issues about equity and the allocation of government funds and also about states rights. I conclude by pointing out to the opposition that these parochial attitudes being developed by conservative state premiers around the nation are playing on the very worst features of Australian society and Australian values. They are appealing to uncertainty and fear about distance and isolation&mdash;things that this nation should be overcoming by using technology, transport and telecommunications, to bring Australians together rather than to pull them apart under this phoney banner of states rights&mdash;and playing up to these fears around the nation. That has occurred with not only the Tasmanian criminal code but also the native title legislation, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) pointed out in question time earlier today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to address a few remarks to the pride that I know the city of Mackay in Queensland feels about the success of Cathy Freeman in the 400 metres yesterday, establishing a Commonwealth record time. I must say to Cathy that what she has achieved on this occasion has been very well received and has earned the respect and pride of all the Mackay people. We applaud her for her efforts.</PARA></TALK.START>

Achieving a win like this reflects so much on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> My only regret about the win is the means by which the media has plagued this lass for carrying a symbol of her race demonstrating her pride and respect.

That young lady can stand tall not only as an Aboriginal achiever but as an Australian.

She can also stand tall as a woman who has achieved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I particularly rise here this evening to speak of a proposal for a medium density fibreboard plant at Georgetown in my electorate. This proposal is incredibly exciting for the people of Georgetown. They have copped some pretty hard knocks in recent times. Last year, Georgetown lost its ferry service to Port Welshpool, and there is continuing speculation as to  whether Comalco will remove its operations from the area. This proposal will mean a $90 million investment in the Georgetown area. Seventy jobs will be created in the construction phase of the project, and 126 new permanent jobs will come on stream when the plant becomes operational. One of the most important points about this plant is that it will create annual export earnings of over $70 million. This contribution would be incredibly positive for our nation's balance of payments deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a strategic process for Tasmania. It will be the first plant of its kind in the state. The potential for expansion is enormous. At the moment, worldwide demand far exceeds worldwide supply for the product. This is projected to continue well into the next century. There is the distinct possibility that there could be further plants created in Tasmania to produce this project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initial idea for this type of development came from Kevin French Enterprises. Whilst Kevin French is not involved in this development, he still sees the possibility of a second plant in the same area under his control in the future. This proposal is an all-round win. It is a win for the people of Georgetown through the development of jobs and development; it is a win for the people of Tasmania as it represents the beginning of increased investment in the state; it is a win for the country nationally through additional export earnings; but, most importantly, however, it is a win without environmental costs. Let me explain how. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> At the moment in Tasmania, we are in the happy position of having a surplus between the current maximum demand for hardwood pulpwood and the annual sustainable supply. The requirement of this plant will be 250,000 tonnes of resource per annum. At least 200,000 tonnes of resource will be hardwood species, with the remainder being plantation softwood sawmill residues. This level of resource comes well within the level of surplus that Tasmania now has. I must stress that none of the resources for this plant will come from environmentally sensitive areas or even those areas that are in dispute as to their environmental value or sensitivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The plant will utilise cutting edge technology so that it operates well within acceptable environmental levels. It will be well situated over one kilometre from the closest population centre, and noise will be kept to a bare minimum with the use of state-of-the-art noise reduction equipment in the chipping process. The wood dust created by the plant will be at very low levels, even at the plant's own boundary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a simple process which is very clean. It will help an area of Tasmania which is in need and value add for the country. But it will have to be approved by the Foreign Investment Review Board. I am sure that I do not have to inform members of the House that every minister has an ability to have an input into the Foreign Investment Review Board process. I have risen tonight to make this House aware of the virtues of the scheme and to ask all those who do have an input into this approval process to consider a number of facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Georgetown is in an area of northern Tasmania which needs confidence, stimulation and investment. The people of Georgetown are a resilient lot, but they need business investment in that area. The process is sustainable and clean. I am glad to say that it has the tacit approval of the Tasmanian Greens for this very reason. This is genuine downstream processing and value adding at its best, creating significant export earnings for the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Assuming there are no unforeseen delays, this plant will start taking wood by the middle of 1996. That will be a great time for northern Tasmania. I commend this project to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Twenty-four years ago&mdash;in 1970&mdash;in Edinburgh, a Jamaican girl, Ms Marilyn Neufville, set a world record of 51.02 seconds in winning the gold medal for the 400 metres event at the Commonwealth Games. It has stood as the games record until now. Little did anyone realise at the time that it would be another three years before the person who would beat that games record was even born. That person, of course, was Ms Cathy Freeman, who won the women's Commonwealth Games 400 metres event in Victoria, Canada, yesterday with her record breaking 50.38 seconds. The defending champion, the Nigerian, Ms Fatima Yusuf, was second, while the Jamaican, Ms Sandie Richards, came third.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The run was particularly special because, in winning, Cathy became the first Aboriginal woman to win an individual event in any sport at a Commonwealth Games. As a 17-year-old, Cathy shared the 4 x 100 relay gold at the Auckland games. I can remember as a teenager the first Aboriginal males to win gold&mdash;Percy Hobson in high jump and Jeff Dynevor, the Queensland bantamweight boxer in the 1962 Perth games. Cathy recently set the Australian record of 50.18 seconds in a run in Europe and will surely become the first Australian woman to go under 50 seconds. Remarkably, she has been a 100 metre and 200 metre sprint specialist. She has been serious about the 400 metre run only over the last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Born in Mackay, Queensland, Cathy grew up there, although she is now based in Melbourne. Most of her family live in Brisbane. Her father, Norman, separated from her mother, Cecilia, when Cathy was five. Cathy found that a difficult period in her life but, even though Norman died last year, I am pleased to say that he reconciled his relationship with Cathy some years ago. Cathy has two younger brothers&mdash;Garth, 18 and Norman, 20. The latter was the Australian under-17 100 metre and 200 metre sprint champion in 1990. She also has an older brother, Gavin, who is 33. Sadly, her sister, Anne-Marie, died from cerebral palsy in 1990 and Cathy had to attend her funeral on the day of the coming home parade after the Auckland games. Naturally, Cathy's mother, Cecilia, and stepfather, Bruce Barber, are both thrilled at Cathy's latest success. As Bruce said, we have only started to see the best of Cathy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably, considerable media hype has blown up since  the brief comments by a member in this chamber about Cathy carrying the Aboriginal flag after her fantastic win. As I am a keen athletics fan, I was watching the race live on television, so I saw what happened after the race in context. Cathy was obviously delighted with her win. As soon as she caught her breath, she raced to the fence to get an Aboriginal flag of hers from a supporter in the crowd who was holding it for her. Cathy had packed this flag and carried it with her in her suitcase so she could display it if she won the 400 metres&mdash;`just in case I won', to use her words. She wanted to display it to the world; to proclaim her pride in being an Aboriginal. While I understand that some people would have misgivings about this action, it should be emphasised that, within a few steps, Cathy also sought out from the crowd an Australian flag to carry. We then saw a very happy girl walking around the stadium soaking up those special moments that only gold medal winners can experience. It was a fabulous event to behold and I am sure that all Australians were celebrating this fabulous victory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I understand fully the argument that we do not want all ethnic groupings from Australia displaying their special flags after every win, I do think that this occasion was different and special. I do not pretend to be able to explain it logically, but here was our first female Aboriginal gold medal winner on display. It was very emotional for all of us, and I would think more so for Aborigines and Cathy herself. Here at last was a wonderful success for the Aboriginal race, in the great tradition of Evonne Goolagong-Cawley, Lionel Rose, the Ella brothers and the like. We all call for Aboriginal success stories and Cathy gave us one. But it was not only a success for Cathy or for Aborigines, but also a success for all Australians. Cathy was mature enough to realise that and carry both flags. It was a joyous event for a gracious young girl and her audience, but also something far more powerful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that Cathy's actions were not out of place for the occasion. I do not believe that anyone should deny Cathy her moment of special glory which we all shared and I am confident that she is mature enough to handle any such occasion in future with equal aplomb. She has been a great role model for Aboriginal children in a very genuine way, trying to inspire these people to rise and better themselves in this world, and I believe that her attitude in this should be applauded. No doubt she will also perform well in the 200 metres, although I do have some misgivings there because Melinda Gainsford used to live up the road from me in Narromine in my electorate, and no doubt it will be a great contest between the two. I also look forward to Cathy's performance with Melinda and the other Australian girls in the relay. If the rest of Australia could cooperate and work together as these girls will, Australia would be a better place to live in. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend the comments made by the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) and I suggest that he look at the great achievement of Aboriginals over the last 200 years&mdash;surviving. Tonight I would like to discuss comments about ANL. The Australian National Line has been under a cloud of controversy over the last few days. Figures brought forward, particularly from 1988, have shown that the results of ANL have been less than favourable. I suggest that shipping is very much a barometer of world economic activity, and world economic activity since 1988 has been as rocky as the results that ANL has produced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The health of land based industries is reflected in, for example, the building trade. When the building trade is in decline or is at the bottom and not doing well, it is usually a reflection of the same sorts of activities going on in manufacturing industry and other land based industries. It is on that basis that I suggest we look at the full 10 years of ANL's results. When the world economy was healthy, ANL was doing a good job. We should look at it on the basis of where we are in the world geographically. We are an island and we cannot get away from that. The Australian National Line has given us more than just profits in terms of what it delivers in expertise from the operation of the company&mdash;it delivers us positions on international boards controlling shipping. It gives us a say in what happens in terms of shipping. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> has been a world recognised document which has shown that this parliament and this country have taken a leading role to stop loss of life and try to improve the situation for both the operation and the quality of services provided in the world carriage of goods over oceans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that we look at the trucking industry in Australia. If honourable members go back a few years, they would remember the days of the shonky operators and the trucks  having dodgy registration checks. That industry was substantially cleaned up for the betterment of the whole of the Australian population. I believe that ANL is a vehicle which this government can use to clean up what is happening in world shipping. World shipping is in a state of disaster. To get the world fleet up to a standard of safety for ships 12 years old would require $400 billion. There is not the capacity in shipyards around the world to do that. As I understand it, the average age of ships is 18 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, we need worldwide focus on and action addressing this problem. Although my beliefs are contrary to popular belief&mdash;Mr Speaker, you know that I do not always swim with the tide; I sometimes swim against it&mdash;I feel that this government should be putting massive injections of capital into ANL. I do so with a number of reasons in mind. Firstly, we are an island; secondly, if we are going to export to the rest of the world we are going to have to do it by shipping and; thirdly, if we lose control or influence in the shipping industry in terms of shipping rates, we are going to be at the mercy of the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst it may seem a short-term goal to take away this seeming problem or to privatise ANL, I suggest that, in the long-term interests of this country, we have to recognise that we are an island, that there are seas between us and that, if we want to continue to import and export, we have to have&mdash;whether we like it or not&mdash;a significant role in shipping. To have that role in shipping is a responsibility of this government. I believe that if we cannot run a shipping company we should not be running a government. I believe that we should be putting money into ANL and capitalising ANL to an extent to which it can compete. </PARA>

Of course, we know that cancer today is not a death sentence. Indeed, a great deal of cancer is operable and can be treated, and people do respond to that treatment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I bring to the attention of the House a report that appeared in the<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Newcastle Herald</EMPHASIS> on Friday, 12 August about one of my constituents who is in hospital suffering from cancer of the prostate gland. He had been advised that his treatment could not continue because the radiotherapy device that was necessary was not available. The queues were too long. He was left in hospital without the support of treatment. By the middle of the following week, the cancer had progressed so far that he had effectively become a paraplegic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week, another of my constituents, a former seaman, came to see me. He was obviously distraught. He bared his chest&mdash;it was a pretty big chest&mdash;and showed me a couple of tattoo spots on his chest. He held up a copy of the newspaper and said, `Listen, mate, when things go this far, it's gone too bloody far. I am concerned. I have been diagnosed as having lung cancer. I have had one treatment and I have been told that I can get the next one in six to eight weeks.' He is concerned because he does not know how far that cancer will spread through his body by the time he can get the next treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year, we heard the stories of women in the western suburbs of Sydney having mastectomies because they were diagnosed as having breast cancer and they knew that, if they waited for radiotherapy that would most likely cure their disease, it could advance so far that they were placing their life at risk. That is the state of radiotherapy in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was very interesting to hear the minister speak yesterday about whose responsibility it is to provide the resources for this treatment. Obviously, it is the responsibility of the states. As a representative from New South Wales, I have done some research into the provision of radiotherapy and into the provision of funding for hospitals in New South Wales. I find it a disgrace that, in 1992-93, the Fahey government in New South Wales underspent its health budget by some $82 million&mdash;enough to provide in the order of 82 linear accelerators that are necessary to provide radiotherapy for the people I am talking about. Of course, the Hunter region essentially requires only one. We are focused on one of the fastest growing areas of Australia. Currently there are two linear accelerators that can be used for radiotherapy. I have spoken at length with Dr Chris Hamilton, who is the director of radiation oncology at the Mater Hospital. He advises me that currently the demand is for about 2.3 to 2.7 linear accelerators. That is based on the resident population in the Hunter. But we serve a much wider area which means that the demand is really for about three or a little more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure how many people will die while we wait for the Fahey government to accept its responsibilities, but obviously people are dying and people are distressed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge all members to look forward to the amount of money that will be spent on health, on the sort of treatment that is vitally necessary for those people who are very concerned about the future of their own life.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I congratulate the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) on the research he did on what I believe is a very topical subject at the moment&mdash;the life and times of Cathy Freeman. The honourable member deserves credit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter I want to address is one with which you, Mr Speaker, would be familiar&mdash;the Martin banking committee, the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, which you chaired, and some of the recommendations that were made. They were not recommendations to government but recommendations to the banking industry and to consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you will recall, Mr Speaker, being chairman of that committee, the committee sought to have mediation entered into with a view to relieving the burden of legal costs borne by both parties&mdash;more particularly by the consumers themselves, because they were obviously in a state. At the time of our investigations, there were disputes with the banks concerning foreign currency borrowings. I am pleased to say that mediation is taking place, although it may not be taking place as expeditiously as we thought it would. It is taking place in a minimum number of cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter of concern to the committee at the time of the inquiry was the cost of legal expenses and how they could be reduced. This is very much a weapon in the hands of the banks&mdash;as it is in the hands of any big enterprise in Australia&mdash;if somebody wants to take such an enterprise to court on a civil matter. So there are a few problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There tends to be a reluctance&mdash;I am not talking specifically about banks now; I am talking about big business&mdash;to get legal representation to mount a case against big business. It is almost like the golden rule: he who has the gold makes the rules. In this case the big companies with an unlimited amount of resources can afford to take a case to the extreme&mdash;to appeal, reappeal and everything else that a plaintiff cannot do. They have access to good legal representation and to continued representation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When a plaintiff makes a claim against a bank or a big company he knows that his resources are going to shrink&mdash;and there is no guarantee of success in this game, particularly with the appeal mechanism. The plaintiff has dwindling resources. Even if the plaintiff wins a case&mdash;and this has happened so many times with foreign borrowers&mdash;on appeal he may not be able to get proper representation. It is quite often the case that a QC who acts initially for a plaintiff and gets a favourable result is not available to take on the case on a continuing basis and to take it to appeal. This has been a major disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give honourable members an example of an extreme case involving foreign borrowing. It has been through the court system, the appeal system, and it is still going on. On this occasion the bank was trying to bankrupt the individual involved&mdash;this would not have been difficult because the individual did not have a cent to bless himself with&mdash;and it proceeded to bankruptcy proceedings. One would have thought that simple bankruptcy proceedings would have required the plaintiff&mdash;on this occasion the bank&mdash;with one legal representative. However, on this occasion the bank was so determined to get a conviction that it brought along a QC and six other lawyers, as against one representative for the person concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise this question not only because of the ability of big companies to buy their own justice&mdash;I use that word deliberately&mdash;but also because they know that in the ultimate those legal expenses, which in some individual cases have amounted to over $1 million, are tax deductible.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My apologies, I thought I could do it sitting down. To continue, the purpose of the Environment, Sport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 is to repeal obsolete legislation and to make minor amendments to other legislation. The bill repeals the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1930 and the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1933. These acts, which were amendment acts to the principal act, the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910, are entirely spent. The principal act will remain in force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also repeals the National Fitness Act 1941. This act was enacted because of concerns about the physical fitness of Australian youth for military service during the Second World War. The act established a national fitness council to advise the minister and a trust account, the National Fitness Fund, for moneys appropriated for the purpose of furthering the objects of the act, including setting up state fitness councils. The act fell into disuse during the 1970s when the functions of the Commonwealth and state fitness councils were taken over by other bodies. The National Fitness Council was phased out in 1975 and the National Fitness Fund was last used in 1986. The bill provides for the balance in the National Fitness Fund, currently $129, to be transferred to consolidated revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also amends the Christmas Island Act 1958 and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act 1955 to enable the parliamentary secretary responsible for territories or another minister to exercise the powers of the minister under these acts. Currently, powers under Western Australian laws in force in the Indian Ocean territories are vested exclusively in the responsible minister, who delegates the powers to the parliamentary secretary. This amendment will simplify administration matters when there is a change of minister or parliamentary secretary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes three amendments to the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992. Firstly, it makes it clear that the definition of `Commonwealth agency' does not include any person in the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory or Norfolk Island governments and their instrumentalities. Secondly, the bill provides that it is not compulsory to make regulations to extend the criteria in the definition of `ecological community', as there is currently no need to extend the criteria. Thirdly, the bill removes a contradiction in the act with reference to the review function. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also amends two references in the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 to the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park by replacing the old name with the new. The name was changed by proclamation from Uluru (Ayers Rock-Mount Olga) National Park on 27 May 1993. The bill also corrects an incorrect reference to a section number. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope that I will be able to go through the procedure a little more correctly than the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mr Snowdon). I am delighted that you gave him some latitude in the carrying out of his duties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill, as the parliamentary secretary has said in the second reading speech which we now have before us, is really an administrative procedure to deal with some acts which need some changing and some amendment. The opposition has no particular disagreement with any of those changes. Certainly, we have no disagreement with the change of name for Uluru, and we have no disagreement with any of the other changes that have been promoted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as several of the bills amended&mdash;for example, the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992 and the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975&mdash;are across my shadow portfolio I would like to take the opportunity, and I think it is appropriate, to make some general remarks in regard to those two areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the endangered species problem, because of which the 1992 act was passed, I really think it is time that this country had a look at whether it is succeeding or failing to deal with the problem of what is becoming an increasingly large group of the wildlife of this country. Is the Commonwealth, for its part, improving the situation or holding the situation? Does it understand the dimensions of the problem? Has it really understood the interrelationship between the feral pest problem and the deterioration in the number of native species in this country over the last 200 years?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is difficult to separate the problem of endangered species from the feral pest problem. The feral pest program began in 1992-93 and it has been allocated about $2 million a year. It has environmental objectives, including saving endangered species and conservation. It does not receive much money, especially as almost daily we hear that we have large groups of species that are on the endangered list. As I understand it, most of those funds are for research and eradication. That is something that we do not object to as long as the research comes up with solutions to the problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The endangered species program, which receives $5.4 million per year, is really, as I understand it, combined with the feral pest program where that includes a feral animal problem. That $2 million for the feral pest program includes any joint state-federal projects. Does the government believe that those programs are succeeding?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not all the fault of the federal government, because states have many responsibilities and plenty of power in the area of the species that exist within their borders. The states have the power to promote the rejuvenation of species. They have the power to lock them up. The Commonwealth needs to provide some sort of leadership in a combined attempt to make sure that as much as possible is done to change the deteriorating state of our native species. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just come back to the point about feral animals. In the last few years&mdash;I think mainly because of the efforts of a lot of private individuals who have been very concerned about these things for a long time&mdash;the fox and the cat have probably been identified as the major destroyers of the smaller Australian native species. Everybody knows that pound for pound the feline is probably the best destroyer in the world. Whether you are dealing with small cats in this country&mdash;which are getting larger, I might say, the more feral they get&mdash;or whether you are dealing with larger ones in other parts of the world, they are a very successful predator, the most successful perhaps, although some people believe that the fox has done as well in destroying our native animals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having been involved in agriculture for a long time, I think that what has been missing in this whole matter is that the goals of eradication of these feral populations have never been laid down by anybody. I have never seen, at state or federal level, a goal to eradicate any of the major feral animal populations. Yet I would have to say that in the case of the feral goat it would seem impossible that we could not put down a plan, a set of goals, to eradicate that very dangerous species. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a dangerous species for two reasons: firstly, because it is a destroyer of Australian native habitat, as it has been in northern Africa and southern Europe in a way that probably will never be recovered, but, secondly, from the disease point of view, particularly foot and mouth disease. With no borders in this country it runs rampant and is obviously very dangerous to Australia's domesticated stock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I have never understood why we should not be able to set goals in place whereby we set out to deal with those problems. That is not to mention the rabbit population, the brumby population, the donkey population or the fact that we have the greatest population of feral animals of any country on earth. Perhaps the federal government does not understand that. Perhaps the federal government thinks that it is appropriate enough to wander around the world signing treaties, some of which&mdash;or most of which, perhaps&mdash;we will not be able to abide by while we have this deteriorating situation in our own country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would suggest to the government that in the process of doing this research on endangered species we broaden our mind-set and do not adhere to the view that governments are the organisations that can preserve and conserve things. That time has long passed. Many other countries in the world now understand quite clearly that it is probably individuals who, for one reason or another&mdash;whether they simply have a great heartfelt desire to do so or whether for reasons of earning a living or for more grandiose reasons than that&mdash;make the greatest contribution to the saving of some of these animals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One need only draw attention to the much quoted and much known elephant program in Zimbabwe which, by means of some processes which some people abhor, has managed to give some equity in that elephant population to the local people, who have turned out to be the great protectors of those animals in the face of an almost rabid ivory trade trying to poach them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that we have not succeeded in this country. In fact we have failed mightily, and there are many people at fault, not the least of whom are the people who sit in this chamber. Therefore, we should open our minds&mdash;and, perhaps, our purses. If we are to set goals about eradication of feral animals and the expansion of our native species, then we have to do it with science and with resources, and we have to use all of the available information from around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will finish on that subject by putting on record in this chamber the dimensions of the problem that we are dealing with. I know it is impossible for people to be absolutely sure about numbers, but cats are known to hunt and kill over 100 species. Only the other day at Roxby Downs, I saw the contents of the stomach of a cat which had been shot by the Western Mining people's environmental group. There were 32 different and undigested reptiles in the stomach contents of that cat. In other words, they had been consumed in the previous 30 hours, I am told. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cats can consume 100 species of native birds, 50 mammals and 50 reptiles, and numerous frogs and insects. You might in passing ask what has happened to the frog population of this country in the last 10 or 15 years. I will bet that there is nobody in this chamber who understands that our frogs are disappearing. They are simply disappearing from Australia at an unbelievable rate, and nobody knows why; although there are various causes which are possibilities. Again, we do not know the population of cats, but the possibility is that there are somewhere between four million and 18 million feral cats in this country. I have no idea, but let us call it 10 million. That is an enormous population of predators who, pound for pound, are the best destroyers in the universe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rabbits are on the increase, again. Perhaps not so much in the high rainfall country where myxomatosis is still operating but across that great band of country from southern Queensland through western New South Wales and across the north of South Australia and the south of the Northern Territory and into the Western Australian pastoral country they are simply out of control. I do not say that it is easy to set goals to deal with the rabbit population. This country is the best harbour for rabbits that they have ever found. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, rabbits are a terrifying problem and are probably doing more damage today than are almost any other animals&mdash;including the domesticated ones, where they are overstocked. We have to really put some resources into this, and very urgently. The rabbit problem is being addressed around this country, bit by bit, but the effort is disparate: it is not a coordinated, combined effort. We can extend the debate on that subject on another day. But the estimate is that the rabbit problem has caused about $100 million worth of damage, and I would think it is much more today, as rabbit numbers expand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The feral pig is here in numbers which, again, are probably out of control. Again I say, why could we not, with a proper program, eliminate the feral pig from Australia progressively from the south? It is not an impossibility. Maybe Queensland and the top end of the Territory will be tough but, until we narrow it down and get a lot of effort concentrated in one area, we will never do it. So it is geographical and strategic planning that needs to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The brumby, the camel, the horse and, as I have mentioned, the goat are a problem. While the parliamentary secretary is here, I will mention that I was at Shoalwater Bay the other day, and I was absolutely horrified to see that, on the federal government's own land, those islands are just jam-full of feral goats. Even I, at my advanced age&mdash;with a couple of young fellows, a motorbike, a set of yards and a barge&mdash;could get rid of them all, if someone would like to give me the contract. It is just nonsense that those animals are still there. I understand that they were put there years ago so that itinerant sailors who happened to get wrecked would have something to eat. That must have been 150 or 200 years ago; so they should go. The areas that are controlled by the Commonwealth should be dealt with first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me really to the second point that I wish to make. This bill covers the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act and amendments to it. Australia's management of national parks has been less than perfect, and in some cases downright pathetic. With respect to the feral animal problem, nobody knows what feral animals are in what parks and in many cases they are not being properly dealt with. In some areas feral animals are spilling out of national parks onto pastoral land. I know that to be a fact. In many cases, people are feeding the feral animals from the parks on improved pasture and on pastoral land. I do not think that that was the purpose of setting up national parks. I think one of the purposes was to preserve, in its proper sense, what was there before with as little interference from the human species as possible. In some cases it is to preserve them for multiple use, for people to enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leaving that aside, there is also an enormous weed problem in these national parks. When I go around Australia it does not hit me that we are conducting a massive program, supposedly coordinated by the Commonwealth and perhaps resourced by the Commonwealth, to deal with these problems. As the parliamentary secretary knows, even that rather good, rare, dry land species, the athel pine, is out of control in some parts of northern Australia. We need to deal with the problem&mdash;whether it is horehound, or African boxthorn, or whatever it is in whatever park. We also need to deal with the massive problems on the Queensland coast and the Northern Territory coast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bit by bit we are losing parts of Australia, whether it is from farming&mdash;which is my pursuit&mdash;or from weeds, feral animals, salinity or whatever. This issue should be regarded as part of the national infrastructure. It is as much part of the infrastructure of this country, perhaps more, than a road to Darwin and back. If that infrastructure does not stay there, and as time goes on, this country will simply deteriorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get back to national parks. I raise the example of the Mungo National Park. The Mungo National Park is a park in south-western New South Wales. It is north-north-west of Balranald and north-east of Mildura. It comprises some 370,000 hectares of land. Owing to the presence of a very ancient dry lake, which dates back to the ice age, the park has significant records of Aboriginal heritage and past climates preserved in the landscape. However, after 13 years of being an area that has World Heritage listing, there is still no management plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of years ago, the Commonwealth and New South Wales put in place a plan to plan a management plan. This is a ridiculous lack of strategy. All of the people who live in the area are still in the position where they do not know exactly what is going to happen to them. I notice that, as part of the 1993 agreement, a study will take place to assess the impact of World Heritage listing&mdash;13 years later&mdash;on the pastoralists who live in the area. This is what has been happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to be too unfair, but this government has been in place for the last 11 years, though there have been previous governments at fault. But as time has gone on, governments and the people of this country have come to realise the extent of some of these problems. We knew much more in the 1980s than we knew in the 1970s and we know much more in the 1990s than we knew in the 1980s. But 13 years after the announcement of the World Heritage listing, we are still doing a study to find out the impact on the locals, and we do not have a management plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Will the study include the drop in value, if there has been one? Will it include any increase in value? Will it include any cost of compensation? I will bet it will not, but it should. After all, the government imposed a new set of conditions in one form or another, with some obligations and some ties back to UNESCO, on some people who live there, without a plan. I have no problem with the listing of World Heritage areas as long as it is done properly and the listing requirements are properly complied with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might just be the time to finish on this note by saying that today the listing requirements require the full approval of the local community. The nomination has to be in accordance with section 41 of the World Heritage listing requirements, which I think were changed in February 1994. Those listing rules are altered quite regularly. They say that the nomination should be prepared in collaboration with and with the full approval of the local communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is terrific, seeing that the current Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) is trying to list the Lake Eyre basin, at least 38 per cent or 40 per cent of the Lake Eyre basin. Not the Parliamentary Secretary's part of the Lake Eyre Basin; he obviously talked him out of that. Not the Queensland part of the Lake Eyre Basin; the Queensland Labor Party has talked him out of that and told him to go and jump in the lake&mdash;not Lake Eyre but any other lake. Not the New South Wales part, which is eight per cent or whatever it is, but only the South Australian part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister is obviously trying to do it without the full approval of the local communities. The rules say that there should be a management plan. He could not possibly have a management plan for Lake Eyre because he has not got the approval of the locals, which he needs if he is going to have a proper plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go on with it. But all of those things need to be addressed. It brings me back to the Willandra problem. Of course, the Mungo National Park is in the Willandra Lakes area, and there is a national park which, again, has not been properly managed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps with those few remarks we might be able in this place to start to address the problems, which are mighty. Last week I flew around Western Australia in a light aircraft at the right height to see the still encroaching salinity problems of that state. Unlike some of the salinity problems of the east, they may be able to be dealt with. But to see that happening in front of your eyes at an ever increasing rate brings us now to the point where we really need to address these problems with all of the resources that are available to us, both in the Commonwealth and around the states. </PARA>

Listening to the shadow minister, I was interested to understand how in politics you can become expert on feral animals and weeds, although in my seat of Werriwa I think some of my constituents would be more interested in weeds than feral animals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My intention is to address my remarks to the provisions of the bill concerning amendments to the Urban and Regional Development (Financial Assistance) Act 1974, which in turn allows the Commonwealth to agree with the states on various forms of federal assistance for approved programs such as urban expansion, sewerage and water supply. I will be concentrating not so much on the environmental part of the bill but on those parts affecting urban and regional development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the south-west of Sydney the main employment opportunity comes out of an international airport at Badgerys Creek, potentially the largest job generating project in Australia. A study by the National Institute in December 1991 showed that the combined impact of the airport would create more than 30,000 jobs over 20 years through construction, airport management and, most significantly, the clustering of manufacturing and tourism industries around the airport site. That is where it is linked to this legislation. In developing the land around the airport site, which is a great economic development opportunity, the provisions of the 1974 Urban and Regional Development (Financial Assistance) Act could be used by the Commonwealth government to assist with the economic expansion and the reticulated services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of the development of the airport and the urban and regional development consequences raises the question of the suitability of these major economic projects within Australia's federal system of government. In trying to get these major public and private development projects moving in Australia, we pay a price for a federal system of government. I am concerned, in relation to Badgerys Creek airport, that the involvement of three federal instrumentalities&mdash;the Department of Transport, the FAC and the Environment Protection Authority&mdash;the two state departments of transport and planning, a range of public bodies needed to service the land and two local government authorities will not produce an environment which maximises private investment on and surrounding the airport site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, I attended a briefing session with the FAC a few weeks ago where it was explained that aeronautical and industrial activities, in the absence of freehold arrangements, are unlikely to be attracted onto the airport site. Freeholdings can restrict the future planning and expansion of airport facilities. Moreover, the FAC sees no further role for itself in the planning and airport development of Badgerys Creek other than on commission from the Department of Transport. Already potential investors in aeronautical activities, such as PJP Aerospace and Defence Industries, have been disheartened by the confusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be desirable, therefore, to release industrial and commercial land surrounding the airport site to allow the development of a range of private sector investments. It has always been envisaged that the greatest employment growth from Sydney west airport would arise from these activities. Moreover, the absence of industrial zoning and activity will limit the airport's potential for freight movements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unhappily, I can report to the Main Committee that the New South Wales government is not yet keen to use its planning powers to fast-track these rezonings and to take up the opportunity from that 1974 legislation. Anne Cohen, in her marginal seat of Badgerys Creek, remains an obstacle to progress. She is more worried about the value of her own land in the vicinity of the airport site than about the potential for 30,000 new jobs in her electorate and those electorates surrounding Badgerys Creek. Further, the cooperation of Penrith and Liverpool councils would be required to achieve the desirable outcome. With the stalled development of the MFP in Adelaide, Sydney west airport and the associated development of transport links and economic activity can be Australia's largest development project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It warrants consideration of a development model free from local, state and federal rivalries and competing objectives. This is where the 1974 legislation, amended in this bill, can be used and developed. With the agreement of the New South Wales government, a development authority could be established to handle all aspects: first, the airport's design, construction and transfer to private sector investment; second, construction of the rail link, exploiting any potential for private investment; and third, the release and development of industrial, commercial and residential land surrounding the airport site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The employment benefits of this project can be maximised only by a coordinated and dynamic approach. The federal government, using that 1974 act and in cooperation with the state government, can develop complementary legislation. A model is already there for the Olympics at Homebush Bay, where the development opportunities do not need to jump through the hoops of local, state and federal government but rather there is one authority getting on with the job and the employment opportunities. In the early stages of the airport debate at Badgerys Creek, the prospect of integrated development&mdash;airport construction, transport links and land development&mdash;was the most attractive proposition for large investors such as B plus B development. This type of development can best be achieved under one planning authority. It is the brightest hope for private ownership of Sydney west airport after 1999. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue of private ownership and Badgerys Creek brings me to the question of FAC privatisation. The government has said that the airport and the regional and urban development opportunities will only proceed at Badgerys Creek if the FAC is privatised and the government realises the financial benefits. I am indebted to my colleague the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) for an assessment of FAC privatisation. He circulated a paper and asked seven questions that needed to be answered about FAC privatisation. I mention these to the committee in the context of this very important urban and regional development opportunity for my electorate and south-west Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first question from the honourable member for Melbourne is: has the FAC's performance as the owner and operator of most of Australia's major airports been satisfactory? On this question we need to go, as ever, to an independent source. We have a report by the Prices Surveillance Authority which is very critical of the pricing policies and investment criteria developed by the FAC. Further, we have a statement made in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 27 July by Singapore Airlines about its concerns and suspicions regarding the FAC, accusing it of inefficiency and a lack of accountability. The airline has a whole range of concerns: that the FAC will not improve its standard of information flow; provide a clear assessment on rent; and get moving with the best activities for Singapore Airlines. There is condemnation of the FAC from two independent sources: the PSA and one of the major airlines in this country. I would have thought that, in answering the first question, the evidence shows major concerns about the operation of the FAC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second question is: who owns and operates airports in equivalent countries overseas? We know that in Australia there are 400 airports in private ownership&mdash;or, at least, non-FAC ownership&mdash;including Cairns. At Cairns airport the charges are three times the level set by the FAC at Townsville, yet Cairns has five times the passenger movements per annum and a better link to regional and urban development. That is an important consideration out of this bill before the committee. There are several precedents overseas for private ownership and its value&mdash;in Asia, the United States, Britain and other parts of Europe. There is no concern about the question of what happens overseas, because those countries have demonstrated that private ownership of airports leads to a better incentive for urban and regional development surrounding the airport site. In Australia, at Cairns airport, which is owned by the port authority, we have seen a better link between the operations of the airport and the activities and promotion of the regional economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third question is: how appropriate are the cross-subsidies which currently permeate the FAC network? The FAC uses the same pricing structure at each of its 23 airports, irrespective of local demand and cost factors. Investment and trading strategies hinge on flawed cross-subsidisation practices. A lack of transparency for subsidies between airports and between aeronautical and non-aeronautical activities makes the financial performance of each airport difficult to measure. The grouping of cost and revenue information for seven airports&mdash;Hobart, Cambridge, Alice Springs, Tennant Creek, Bankstown, Camden and Hoxton Park&mdash;makes an external evaluation of their performance impossible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By breaking up the FAC and its monopoly practices, the government can achieve a more rational allocation of airport resources in Australia. Full cost pricing can turn around the financial position of smaller airports and can enhance their attractiveness for privatisation, or at least establish a proper basis for community service obligations. This again exposes the opportunity for urban and regional development, because privately owned airports will want to link with activities in the regional economy and to involve themselves in the sort of promotion and development that could trigger the 1974 legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also very important to understand that, stripped of debt, only two airports out of the FAC network are not profitable&mdash;Mount Isa and Jandakot. There should be no confusion about the profitability of airports once they are stripped of debt. There are only two out of the 23 which would not perform independently, free of debt, once they were privatised. Small airports will not close. I am sure the government would look after community service obligations for Mount Isa and Jandakot and that those airports would remain in operation. As a consequence, the government can move on, knowing that other airports are able to achieve operation and profitability in their own right. These things are important for urban and regional development and we should all be interested in them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the argument about full-cost pricing. There should be little concern about privatised airports charging high prices for airport usage. Use of Cairns airport has not been set back by high prices&mdash;in fact, the opposite has occurred. Cairns airport has five times the passenger movements of Townsville airport, which is operated by the FAC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is an increase in prices, who will pay? A person does not need to be Einstein, or even Barry Jones, to work out that the rich pay because the rich are great users of airports. Working-class, lower income Australians are not high users of Australian airports. It is wealthier people who pass through the passenger gates. The increase in prices is not likely to be substantial because airport related charges make up only three per cent of the cost of domestic airline tickets and five per cent of international tickets. Moreover, airlines spread ticket costs across all their routes and airports, both domestic and international. In terms of equity, there is a very strong argument to say that the people who use airports can afford to pay and, in any case, the increase in prices will not be substantial because of the low impact of airport related charges to ticket prices, domestic and international. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The practice of cross-subsidies for Australia's airports can hold back regional development. This brings me back to the point about Badgerys Creek and the 1974 legislation. By making a substantial profit at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport there was no incentive for the FAC to develop Badgerys Creek airport as quickly as it should have and as demand in the regional economy warranted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth question from our colleague the honourable member for Melbourne was: what impact would privatisation have upon the future delivery of airport services to the Australian community? In many respects, the question about privatisation for the FAC was lost when it was corporatised. It was at that point that the government said that this is an economic and transport activity that can operate according to the rules of the private market. That is why it was corporatised. From that point forward people have logically asked, `If it is operating under private market rules, why can't it operate under private market ownership?' The role of government and the usefulness of the FAC should have generated more controversy and more noise at the stage of corporatisation than it has at privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great benefit that comes out of privatisation is the financial motivation to perform. Government corporatised bodies do not tend to experience the rigour of survival in the market that comes out of private ownership. There is a better financial motivation to perform. So there should not be any scaremongering regarding the extent of increased charges&mdash;they are spread across the industry and have a marginal impact on airport consumers. Privatisation of the FAC will bring a whole range of benefits to the government budget, financing the white paper initiatives and other aspects of urban and regional development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the government could consider a policy statement on privatisation to say that it stands as an infrastructure dividend, that the money raised goes back into the development of infrastructure that is not supported by the private sector. Under the current plan, of the $2 billion to be raised from FAC privatisation only $90 million is coming directly back into infrastructure. That is at Badgerys Creek airport, the very important urban and regional development project for south-west Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth question was: is there scope for significant competition between airports? It is important to recognise that there are varying degrees of competition. There will not be competition at Perth airport because of geographic isolation, but for airports in closer proximity&mdash;Hobart and Launceston, east and west Sydney, Coolangatta and Brisbane&mdash;there is an opportunity for some form of competition. It may be limited, but it can be significant in consumer and business benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other benefit is that the cost system arising from a competitive framework leads to a better operation of airports. When airports have their own cost centre they stand or fall on their own financial performance in terms of capital development and extension of the airport facilities. Cross-subsidisation practices will no longer be artificially propping up some of the regional airports and leading to bad investment decisions, such as the excessive amount of finance that was poured into the development of Darwin and Townsville airports. These are investments which have not realised benefits to the government or to the public relative to how that money could have been better invested in other parts of the public sector. Isolated cost centres will solve that problem and mean a much more rational and efficient allocation of economic resources from the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sixth question was: is selling the FAC airports likely to produce an optimal financial outcome for the federal government, or are there better alternatives? The argument here seems to rest on the views set by Professor Bob Walker from the University of New South Wales, who has stated from his research that the net sale proceeds are likely to amount to between 57 and 78 per cent of the real value of the assets to the federal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In truth, the value of an asset is only realised when it is sold, and the revenue capacity of that asset is built into the sale price. This is a flawed model promoted by Professor Walker that relies on a theoretical construction of companies and company options. I know it is flawed because when I worked in the New South Wales parliament he was known as `rent a result Walker'. He was not beyond gearing up these results to suit the commission he had received from the interested authority. I have no time for his sort of research. It is absurd to say that the federal government would only realise between 57 and 78 per cent of the real value of the assets. Honourable members know that assets only have a real value once they are sold, and revenue streams are built into the sale price as investors try to take advantage of future revenue opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally, I have no time or consideration for Bill Swingler, the Managing Director of the FAC, and his assessment that the FAC is worth more as a whole than if broken up for sale. Four of the airports are the main profit makers. They will realise more finance for the government sold separately than by tying them down in a single sale where they have to continue to prop up, by way of cross-subsidisation, the weaker financial performance of other airports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The seventh question was: what are the implications of privatisation for airport and airline workers? I am pleased to report to the committee that the Transport Workers Union supports the proposition, so the main body of workers is covered in this proposition. Perhaps some of the other unions are more comfortable with the cosy relationship they have established with the FAC, and they have a fear of uncertainty in industrial relations and the environment that follows thereafter. But they are not concerns that loom large in the public interest as defined by the government and parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have answered the seven questions as best I can. They relate specifically to Badgerys Creek airport, which is a major regional economic development opportunity for my electorate of Werriwa in Sydney's south-west. That in turn relates to the Urban and Regional Development (Financial Assistance) Act 1974 which goes to prove&mdash;I know my colleagues agree&mdash;that it is a very broad bill which allows members to bring in all matters&mdash;from feral animals, to weeds, to endangered species, to urban and regional development, to the FAC and privatisation questions. As those opposite have kindly pointed out, the debate will continue in other places. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to support the remarks made by my colleague the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), the shadow minister for the environment, about endangered species and the policy surrounding those matters. The shadow minister has had a lifetime of experience in these matters in pastoral Australia. He has been very close to the problems that rabbits, dingoes and donkeys have caused to a number of our endangered species throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to the chamber that problems do occur in other parts of the world. We in Australia can ensure that some of our endangered species survive by putting some incentives in place to encourage the private sector to support the survival of these particular animals and plants. As the shadow minister quite rightly pointed out, there are a number of feral animals causing terrible destruction to our native animals and fauna. The cat population in Australia is estimated to be between four million and 18 million. In Victoria both the former Labor government and the current Liberal government looked at cat registration. They were concerned about the number of cats moving from the urban areas to the country areas and causing terrible destruction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of brumbies or wild horses is estimated to be 600,000, if that is possible. Their destruction of plants and water points, and the general pressure on the stocking rate, is of great concern to pastoralists throughout Australia. The camel and donkey population, which emerged as a mode of transport from those early imports in the 1850s, seems to be about 150,000. Again, especially with the donkeys, it is a considerable problem that is difficult to control. It is hard to round them up and it is hard to get rid of them. </PARA>

In broad terms, we can see that these feral animals are having a devastating effect on both the vegetation and the native animals of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to draw the attention of the chamber to the example of the elephants in Africa and the way the world community is trying to maintain the elephants. As honourable members would be aware, the price of ivory is a very key factor. The world community has therefore banned the trade of ivory but then of course a black market developed where prices could be built up and the encouragement to poachers became even greater. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, the African elephant was placed on the list of endangered species. It was hoped that by putting it on this list and banning the trade of ivory the African elephant numbers would be improved. I just make the observation that the ban on alcohol in prohibition America exemplified the fact that prohibition itself did not reduce the consumption of alcohol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The black rhino was also placed on the list under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species but the numbers crashed from 80,000 in 1975 to 4,000 in 1990. So although it was banned by the international organisation, because of the activities of the poachers and the value of the rhino horns, the rhinos were a lucrative source of income for the local people and the numbers fell quite dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation arises that Western countries expect poorer nations to protect their species by way of police forces et cetera but, with their very low level of productive wealth, this is a great burden on some of the African communities. In pre-colonial days, the local communities regarded the elephant as a valuable source of food and hide. Local people developed strategies to manage the population numbers effectively, to guarantee the survival of the species. So there was an incentive to keep the elephant numbers up and not shoot elephants for the value of their tusks. Once this incentive for the locals was lost, there was an encouragement to destroy the elephants for the value of the ivory, either in a commercial sense or in the sense that the poachers could use what were almost minor armies to poach the animals and then sell the ivory on the open market or the black market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another interesting comparison is the Basel convention on the trade of hazardous wastes, a similar proposition put forward by the Greenpeace organisation, which states that Third World countries cannot trade toxic or hazardous wastes from OECD countries to non-OECD countries. Although we might agree with the sentiments of that convention, a similar outcome emerges in that the developing countries lose the comparative advantage they had in terms of labour costs and stand to lose under it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As occurs with the banning of drugs, the banning of the sale of ivory in Western markets encourages a black market. It does not guarantee that the numbers of elephants will be maintained and the poachers are encouraged to get bigger, better and more effective. There is no real notion of private ownership by the village people of the elephants and therefore no incentive to keep them in their current numbers. So the African nations illustrate the need for an incentive to maintain the endangered species, if we put the elephants in that category. The local people need to have an interest in keeping them in their current numbers and derive some commercial benefit from doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to another interesting example of endangered species that the honourable member for Scullin and I inspected on the trip to Bangladesh and Nepal. In Nepal there is an interesting exercise aimed at encouraging people to maintain their forests.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not voting for him at the Hobart conference but he is a colleague and a friend of mine in other matters. To continue, when we visited the minister for forests, Mr Bir Mani Dhakal, he discussed the Nepal-Australia  community forest project and the very important change of attitude among the local people&mdash;similar to that relating to the elephants&mdash;that the Australians had managed to encourage at both the government and local level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation that the government has introduced, at the behest of the Australians, includes the concept that a percentage of the forest be put back into local and private hands. The new management plan anticipates that 60 per cent of the forests will eventually be controlled by local communities, with 40 per cent remaining as state forest. That is a key change of attitude and policy by the government. It is based on the premise that if the locals take over control of their forest area they will maintain it and ensure that regeneration takes place, so that the forest and species that are being depleted across the face of Nepal will be regenerated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Scullin will recall, we looked at areas throughout Nepal where this policy has been put in place and vast areas of bare landscape are now beginning to be covered by new forests. Our report about the project states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The success of the NACFP projects is based on the principles of profit and sustainable development. Villages look after the forests because of the community gain. Trees are grown for commercial exploitation and the plantations are safeguarded by villages who use the prunings for fuel. There is a financial incentive to increase the amount of land under forestry, and so regeneration is encouraged. There is another performance indicator: NACFP officers reported an increase in the number of leopards seen in the hills, indicative of the increased forest cover.</PARA>
<PARA>Delegation members were particularly impressed with this project, not only because of what we saw on the ground but also because of the underlying philosophic thrust behind this change in attitude that tour leader Bill Jackson explained to us. We were impressed with the way in which the local people had embraced this change of attitude. We were told of improvements in a number of areas, including in the amount of fuel available for villages, the sawlogs that emerged from the particular forest areas we inspected, the regeneration of the forest cover and the lack of erosion. This recovery is occurring after 300 years of devastation through the cutting down of the country's forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very good example of what we should be doing in Australia. We should be encouraging the authorities, and, in my view, the private sector operators, to put some commercial value into the forest operations and into endangered species&mdash;if we can put them all into that category that the Australian people are generally concerned about. With some commercial incentives, endangered species&mdash;the fauna and flora, and the national parks&mdash;might be protected and their reproductive capacity encouraged in a similar way to the situation in Nepal and Africa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my view that national parks run by governments tend to send signals to the community of another nature. The community takes the view that national parks, say in Victoria, are the responsibility of `them'&mdash;that is, the government&mdash;and not of the local people, so there is a great tendency for the locals not to be worried about fire, about a build-up of rabbit population or the fuel that caused such a massive disaster on Ash Wednesday. If there is a turnaround in the attitude towards forests and national parks so that people develop a feeling of ownership of those public assets, then they would care for them in a more personal way, as do the people in Nepal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the forests in Victoria and throughout Australia, a similar attitude could be developed whereby people would have some personal ownership. I notice that endangered species have become the key element in the argument about locking up forests rather than whether the forest is sustainable in its own right. My investigations indicate that forest practices in the 1990s suggest that forests are sustainable, that the logging process and regeneration will ensure that forests will go on as they have over the last 2,000 years. Endangered species, such as the koala bears in the south-eastern forests or the owl in northern America, are not the key elements. They become a focal point in public debate about the forests, but let us look also at the capacity of the forests to be sustainable over the long term and provide products as is the case in Nepal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To conclude, I say that my remarks on this occasion at least relate to the bill, compared to those of the previous speaker who was very much keener on developing some arguments against his own colleagues in the government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Environment, Sport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill is short and uncomplicated and aims to amend, and in some cases to repeal, a number of different acts administered within the portfolio of environment, sport and territories.

Australia has asserted sovereignty over Christmas Island since that time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill removes the anomaly of a single word, `exclusively'. Ministerial delegation of power exists in relation to Christmas Island and, therefore, the suggestion that only ministers can act is misleading. This bill clarifies that point.

The Clunies-Ross family, famously associated with the Cocos Islands, began the development of the copra industry with the aid of imported labour. The permanent inhabitants of the islands today are Australian citizens and are descendants of the original labourers who were principally of Malayan, Indonesian, Chinese and African extraction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill seeks to clarify the use of ministerial discretion to enable the minister to delegate powers in relation to the exercise of Commonwealth law in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Both Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands have, respectively, administrators appointed by the federal government and responsible to the Minister for Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner). These territories are not part of any Australian state. Perhaps that situation will not go on forever and we can look forward to a further normalisation of life, whereby these islands become municipalities and do not need to be governed by Canberra officials. However, that development is undoubtedly some way down the road as yet. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also seeks to amend the Urban Regional Development (Financial Assistance) Act 1974. This act is principally concerned with the policy that the Australian government may agree with a state government upon the level of financial assistance to be provided by the Australian government for expenditure by the state on mutually agreed programs. This act had a momentous impact on the day-to-day life of the people of Australia when it was first passed. For the first time, it set the framework for the concept and function of cooperative federalism in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This act allowed the federal and the various state governments to work together in certain cooperative measures to improve the quality of life in Australia. We cannot allow the psychology of `she'll be right' to prevail in Australia. We must marshal our nation's resources to deal with the development of our country. This act did this and still can do it if we want to use it. Ad hoc programs&mdash;concrete bandaids&mdash;based on limited and grudging funds will never achieve the level of development that this underdeveloped nation needs if it is to grow and contribute to the improvement of life for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this act was passed in 1974, 85 per cent of Australians lived in urban areas, and that figure is unchanged. The act was not uniformly successful, although there were some achievements. The act has a three-point program directed towards urban areas, and each point is worthy of itself and indeed worthy today to be a current government policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the act provided for the Australian government to work with the states to change the growth pattern of Australian cities. The policy was to cut back the growth of larger capitals such as Melbourne and Sydney and to promote alternative population centres. Secondly, the act sought to ensure that the continued although slow growth rate of the major cities avoided the problems of the past. Thirdly, the policy sought to arrest and to, in fact, reverse the decline of the general urban environment of our great cities and to improve the services within them. All these policies were interconnected and the success or failure of the policy required, and still does require, a coordinated approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recent efforts by the Australian government to achieve a high level of cooperation between the various levels of government on this continent on matters of competition policy and human rights compare poorly with the success of a similar meeting 20 years ago. On 22 October 1973, a federal Labor minister met with the state ministers&mdash;Labor, Liberal and National&mdash;and agreed on a framework for urban and regional renewal which became the framework for the act which we are today seeking to amend. </PARA>

At that meeting the State Ministers agreed that the Australian Government should remove the artificial and detailed categories under which funds for urban and allied purposes were currently being offered by the Australian Government.</PARA>

However, honourable members who, in fact, do have the welfare of Australia at heart can look at the act which we are amending and, by use of a little imagination, can see that our national progress has been based on cooperation. If all the political parties could cooperate on policy matters in the politically overheated mid-1970s, then surely today we can regain a level of intergovernmental cooperation at least equal to those famous years. </PARA>

They are: the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1930, the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1933 and the National Fitness Act 1941. As honourable members know, when our federation was being put together there was a great and heated debate about whether Sydney or Melbourne should be the national capital. Many and varied and good, and spurious, arguments were advanced in support both of Sydney and Melbourne. Being a Melbourne born and raised girl representing a Sydney electorate, I will pass silently over this matter of great contention. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The standard of discussions and debate in this chamber is similar to that which occurs down in the main House of Representatives chamber.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a very minor piece of legislation before us, but that befits the fact that it was envisaged that non-controversial items would come up here. However, what was envisaged right from the start was that, whilst the legislation might be non-controversial, there was the opportunity for the debate to have a certain amount of controversy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is only coincidental that I have decided to make this speech from the cross benches. It is not a reflection or any sort of comment on the comments of the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) today in this debate. He showed that honourable members of this chamber can still exercise their right to approach legislation, whether or not it is as simple as that before us today, in a very forthright way and can expand and present to a debating chamber such as the Main Committee a broad range of issues that can be properly discussed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I would have to agree that the person occupying the chair at the time showed a great degree of leniency, I did think that his was a very wise decision, because it was appropriate that the honourable member use this opportunity&mdash;under the guise of speaking on the piece of legislation which is being amended: the urban and regional development legislation&mdash;to put the views that he did about issues such as the FAC and matters to do with the privatisation of that organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been outlined quite adequately, not only in the second reading speech but by people such as the honourable member for Lowe (Mrs Easson), there is a series of pieces of legislation which are repealed totally by this bill. Although that has been adequately covered, I note that one of those is the National Fitness Act, and I cannot pass up this opportunity to congratulate the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths), who indicated to me today that he is undertaking quite a fitness campaign by walking around in the very brisk mornings that we confront here in Canberra. I suppose that those flippant remarks are an indication of how, in the 1990s, there abounds in the community a different attitude to fitness matters, one quite distinct and different from that in the 1940s, when it was felt necessary to put in place, as a measure during the war, the National Fitness Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other pieces of legislation that are amended, as has been indicated, are the Christmas Island Act and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act. It is appropriate that the parliamentary secretary&mdash;who has just entered the chamber and will, I am sure, behave&mdash;is a beneficiary of the amendments to be made, because it will be procedurally easier for him to administrate under these acts in the territories since, as a member of the Executive Council he, like his fellow members of the Executive Council, will be given power to use the powers that are delegated under these acts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next pieces of legislation that are amended, admittedly only in a minor manner, are the Endangered Species Protection Act and the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. As others have used the opportunity in this debate, I intend to make some comments about the matters that are covered by those two pieces of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the outset, we should acknowledge the work of the Australian Nature Conservation Agency, which is the principal authority that deals with matters under these two pieces of legislation. Of course, the agency was created back in May of last year, and was the new name for the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. In announcing that change in name, the then minister said that the new name better reflected the wider role that the agency had. Indeed, if one looks at the annual report of the agency, one can see that it does have that wider role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its work with endangered native species, of course, the agency takes up the provisions of the legislation from 1992. One of the principal things that the agency is undertaking at the moment, of course, is the identification of endangered species and communities. Anybody who follows a number of the debates that occur in environmental matters would understand that one of the recurring difficulties is that there are often no benchmark levels by which to test that what is actually occurring is positive and is achieving the aims. That problem can be seen in a wide range of matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My good friend and colleague from the other side of the chamber, the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur), devoted his speech in this debate to forestry management. Forestry management is, again, one of those areas of recent environmental debate that has suffered because that debate did not have the necessary basic information so that that debate could go forward sensibly. On both sides of the argument we had distortions of what people necessarily believed was the actual case. So any work that goes on in any of these areas that establishes what are the base levels of what is happening at the moment is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, if we look at the area of endangered species, we must look at the factors that cause the threat to such species. An endangered species is, by definition, a species that might go into extinction because of a series of identifiable causal occurrences. Some of those causal occurrences or processes might be things such as habitat destruction or degradation of the habitat. Examples of that might be salination, grazing by introduced herbivores and other such things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Threatening processes might be introduced animals, whether they be predators or simply competitors. They might be introduced plants. One example of that in the Northern Territory is Mimosa pigra. If one looks in the annual report of ANCA, the Australian Nature Conservation Agency, one sees that that has been a recurring problem in some of the parks and reserves that it manages in the Northern Territory and is one of the areas that it is tackling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, because of ANCA's activities with Kakadu, it realised that one of the real problems was that the seed source of a lot of the mimosa infiltration into the park was outside the reserve and that there was really a need to have a look at those that controlled neighbouring areas to bring the Mimosa pigra problem under control. For instance, it recommended that there be Commonwealth funding towards the control of Mimosa pigra in the neighbouring Arnhem Land country. It is very important that those sorts of things go on, and agencies such as ANCA are to be applauded for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final category of threatening processes to endangered species is direct exploitation, whether that be through collection or hunting or fishing and the like. All these factors have one thing in common, that they can be controlled by the species homo sapiens. That is very important. Whilst other animals and plants may be the problem, it is in our control to be able to address those problems and to ensure that, wherever possible, endangered species can be protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned that there are also amendments to the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. I have outlined the work that is going on through ANCA. That agency also controls reserves on Christmas Island and Cocos Island. There is the Christmas Island National Park on Christmas Island and on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands the reserve is mainly North Keeling Island, which is listed on the register of National Estate. I cannot remember now whether it is still subject to negotiations or has been confirmed as a fully fledged park or reserve. In both those areas ANCA does a lot of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one reviews the history of Christmas Island, one of the main problems has been the degradation that has occurred to the rainforest as a result of the years of phosphate mining. One of the projects that ANCA is involved in is the rainforest rehabilitation program which uses phosphate export royalty payments which came from the former Christmas Island Phosphate Company. One of the aims in that rehabilitation program is to ensure that the habitat of the endangered Abbott's booby bird is preserved and rehabilitated. Anybody who has visited Christmas Island would understand its rich diversity of bird life. Another significant animal form on the island is the crabs. These two are quite reliant on the rainforest habitat; they are reliant on people trying to improve and rehabilitate those areas that have been mined whilst ensuring that the areas that have not been disturbed remain undisturbed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final piece of legislation that is affected by the Environment, Sport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 is the Urban and Regional Development (Financial Assistance) Act 1974. When I saw that the honourable member for Werriwa was on the list of speakers, I had an inkling that he might speak about that aspect of this bill. I had not worked out that he would do it in the way he did but I acknowledge that he has a great interest in the area of urban and regional development. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we go to those parts of this bill that repeal section 9, I think it is, of the Urban and Regional Development (Financial Assistance) Act 1974 and make minor amendments to section 10 and substitute a new schedule, we should perhaps also go back to the time in 1974 when under the Whitlam government this legislation was first introduced. It is interesting to note the comments of the Minister for Urban and Regional Development, the honourable Tom Uren, at that time. In his speech he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the first time it sets the seal on the concept and function of co-operative federalism in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Before that he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it will have a momentous impact upon the day to day lives of the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>At the moment, as we saw with what happened in Darwin at the COAG meeting, there is a sense of deja vu and a bit of cooperative federalism revisited. One of the real problems is that since 1901 when the colonies came together in a federation, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) observed a few days ago, the colonies, now the states, have seemed to think that federation was in some way a benefit for them and the constitution was cobbled together purely to protect some of their rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the basis of what happened in the run-up in the late 1890s and in the run-up to 1901 and federation was that we created a nation. Perhaps as Australians that should be our first interest. Perhaps all the other matters of jealousies between the colonies are long gone and should be forgotten. One of those things that the piece of legislation in 1974 hoped to achieve was a national outlook on the way in which our urban and regional areas developed. As Tom Uren said at the time:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The great merit of this Bill&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>being the original bill&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is that for the first time the resources of Australia are marshalled to provide national strategies and national programs. It is the first attempt by an Australian Government to recognise the national character of the problems of the cities. In particular it allows the Australian Government to join State and local authorities in planning and implementing programs with a broad national perspective.</PARA>
<PARA>It is unfortunately still the case at the moment that there is a need to revisit this question and a need to develop strategies that will give this national outlook. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before being elected to this place, I was a member of a council in the northern suburbs of Melbourne. At the time I was elected, in the continuing momentum that was first started during the Whitlam years, there was a huge program of works to bring sewerage to suburbs that at the time had been in existence for some 20-odd years, and to areas that were undergoing subdivision in the absence of that basic infrastructure. If we go back to the reason why that was able to be completed towards the end of the 1970s and the early 1980s in the Melbourne metropolitan area, we find that it was because of the impetus that was given during the Whitlam years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we now look into the 1990s, we find that in cities such as Perth the federal government has come back to having an involvement in the provision of what is a fairly basic form of infrastructure for housing development, sewerage, by the funding that has been made available in Western Australia under the better cities program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has to be a realisation that the Australian government, as the national government, can have a constructive role in these questions of urban and regional development, because many of the issues of infrastructure provision are matters that fit under that umbrella. There is a need to understand that there has been a tendency for the overall provision of resources for infrastructure development to be diminishing, and I think we need to redress that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That can only be redressed by the cooperation of the Australian government, the various state and territory governments, and local authorities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One small but significant amendment is to the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. It is a simple replacement of two words, but it is the culmination of several years of effort by the government to ensure proper recognition of the rights and cultures of our indigenous peoples. The amendment simply replaces the words `Ayers Rock' with `Uluru-Kata Tjuta' in the act, enshrining in legislation the government's recognition and respect for the traditional owners and the important cultural role of this landform. Uluru is recognised around the world as a symbol of central Australia, and is one of the most important and well-known individual landforms in Australia; but around the country there are many other significant landforms that need to be protected by legislation and that we should take some cognisance of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate, we have a significant landform in the Wolli Creek area, which is said to reveal in its geological biography ancient oceans that once occupied a significant part of eastern Australia. It is said by geologists that this is the only example of this type of landform left in the Sydney basin. But unfortunately, the state Liberal government in New South Wales is paying a little less respect to this site: it plans to run a tollway through the area. Of course, it has carried out an environmental impact statement, and that does make reference to the site, but, unfortunately, after identifying this important natural occurrence and its uniqueness, the government admits that it will have to&mdash;as it euphemistically phrases it&mdash;`reconstitute' this heritage-rich area laden with rare species, landforms and archaeological sites. I am not quite sure how one reconstitutes an area, but if it is left to the Roads and Traffic Authority we can be pretty sure how that will occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The EIS also identifies midden deposits along the general area of the tollway route, and says that these may contain historic as well as prehistoric material. However, the EIS's appraisal of the impact of the tollway on middens and those sites is summarily dealt with. It is stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Surface disturbance will be minimal, therefore impacts on archaeological sites would be negligible.</PARA>
<PARA>What the EIS is saying here is that there will be one great slab of concrete, followed by tar, slapped on the sites. They may be buried for all time, but, according to the EIS, the impact upon them is `negligible'. I must admit that the EIS does detail mitigative measures, such as hiring an archaeologist `to give particular attention to selection of access roads and depots for the construction works.' The EIS says that a `detailed archaeological study' should be carried out. In other words, the EIS does not include an archaeological survey, despite the indications of the significance of the site. The EIS also states that archaeologists should monitor the excavation of the tollway in areas identified as having this type of archaeological potential. Of course, that is all great stuff, but one would have thought that some of this work would have been carried out in the EIS stage itself, before the government digs up, damages or buries our heritage for all time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the New South Wales government treats the impact of the tollway on residents in a very similar fashion. Of course, if the state government had considered its urban transport future requirements, and done some decent planning for its residents, fulfilling its responsibility to provide adequate public transport, we would not have these black, ugly scars running through Sydney. If the New South Wales government and the Roads and Traffic Authority, which, like the Federal Airports Corporation, is bureaucracy out of control, do not start providing adequate public transport Sydney will do more than resemble Los Angeles: it will surpass Los Angeles for the number of people using cars, and for air pollution and smog, in what should be one of the most beautiful cities in Australia. If the New South Wales government did its job, there would not be a need for the continual drain and demands on the federal coffers to rectify this mess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This leads me to the amendments to the Urban and Regional Development (Financial Assistance) Act before us today, and I will follow up some of the points made by my colleague the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham).

He always took a very principled position with regard to Sydney airport, which was that we should develop another regional capacity outside Sydney; and that is what the government is now doing. The recent conclusions of the so-called community consultation process on the draft noise and air quality management plan that the FAC has put out has only driven home the message of how vital forward regional planning is to the preservation of our city's quality of life and the preservation of the environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members may recall that the Commonwealth government agreed in 1991 to go ahead with the expansion of Sydney airport on the proviso that noise and air quality management plans were introduced to ensure that Sydney residents and the environment were properly compensated and protected from further intrusion by the air transport industry. The community submissions on these draft plans concluded on 12 August. I am told that thousands of submissions by individuals, affected residents, community groups and organisations&mdash;and one that I submitted myself&mdash;have been forwarded to the draft noise and air quality management plan steering committee which comprises the Federal Airports Corporation, the New South Wales Department of Planning, the Environment Protection Authority and the Civil Aviation Authority. That committee will consider these proposals and inclusions in the final draft of the plan which will be out later this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, yesterday my office received a call from a constituent who complained that when he sought to pick up a copy of the draft noise and air quality management plan, just three weeks into the public exhibition and call for comment, there were no copies of the report left, making it extremely difficult for him and other residents to make a submission on the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA>These draft plans, I believe, have only served to highlight how intrusive and regressive a ste this expansion of Sydney airport has been for Sydney, and south-west Sydney in particular, for the residents and the environment in which they live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems and the high costs associated with inadequate regional planning have been driven home to the community, the government and industry alike. We must now ensure that industry is never again permitted to act so intrusively and without regard to its responsibilities to the community. Unfortunately, what has not been driven home is the need for an adequate process for the community to ensure that basic or minimum quality of life standards are maintained. The plans are completely inadequate. They do not go far enough in any shape or form. They do not propose to fairly compensate all noise affected residents, nor do they propose adequate noise mitigation. They do not even examine the full impact of the expanded airport's operation on people who live around the airport. Driven by economic expedience rather than the industry's responsibility to behave as a good neighbour, these drafts highlight how ridiculous it is even to attempt to have industries such as airports regulating themselves. As I said in the submission that I made to the inquiry, the most disgusting flaw of the draft plan is the total disregard for a community which was established long before Sydney airport was expanded in the way it is now. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4I4">Mr LEO McLEAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, the airport was not there first; the people were there first. Marrickville and that part of south-west Sydney was settled in the 1800s. There had been flourishing suburbs around Kingsford Smith airport when it was a racecourse. It was turned into an airport in the 1940s and it was a small airport. What my colleague from the Gold Coast does not realise is that Sydney is becoming different from all the other major cities in the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In every other large capital you have an old 1940s or 1930s style airport close to the centre of the city and you have the major airport for the city out on the city rim. In New York, in London, in Paris, in Rome&mdash;in all the major cities of the world&mdash;the big international operators are out on the city rim and the smaller domestic operators are close in to the city; and that makes sense. It makes more sense in Australia than it does in Europe because, unless they are coming from New Zealand, people who are coming to Australia on international flights are spending a minimum of seven hours on a flight. If they have got to spend another 20 minutes to get into the centre of the city after flying from Singapore or from Hong Kong or from Bangkok for seven or nine hours, they are not going to say, `Shock, horror.' No-one comes from London to Sydney and goes straight to a meeting, or comes from Los Angeles to Sydney and goes straight to a meeting. Another 20 minutes will not hurt at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It made good sense to put the major operators out on the city rim. The Fraser government should have recognised that when it did the major airport needs study for Sydney in the early 1970s. The current government has finally recognised it&mdash;albeit, in my view, a little bit too late. I think it was a mistake to build the third runway, and what we should have done was build a much larger airport out at Badgerys Creek. Minister Brereton, to his credit, has recognised this; and the government in the last budget allocated a substantial amount of money to upgrade Badgerys Creek from being the sort of airport you were going to have when you were not going to have an airport to a proper, large airport that can take wide-bodied jets. That is sensible planning, and it should go further: the people who live around the airport in Sydney should not be the ones who have to pay the price for the increased tourist capacity that Sydney is experiencing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To get back to the noise management plans, 20 per cent of the people who responded to this plan said that their sleep was disturbed by the airport. So while the authors of the draft management plan recognise that noise disturbance to residents from aircraft is significant&mdash;even now, before the operation of the third runway&mdash;they refuse to recognise the responsibility that the airport operators have to the community and include in the proposed noise mitigation program those areas that were in the 20 ANEF zone outside the airport's operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This so-called noise management plan, incredibly, does not consider, other than in a passing mention, the recent changes to air traffic management known as the standard take-off and arrival system. It is about time that a master plan for Sydney airport was developed, ensuring strategic needs of the aviation industry are met and incorporating responsibility to, and the needs of, the community. As the community now perceives the Federal Airports Corporation to be in breach of its own legislation requiring it to be a good neighbour, the FAC should in future only be allowed to assume an advisory role in the development and implementation of these plans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the current curfew regulations need to be reinforced and strengthened by federal government legislation, with a system of penalties for commercial operators who breach them. It is obvious that the people who live around Sydney have to pay some attention to helping with the prosperity of Australia, and they have been reasonable. Members might recall that the curfew at Sydney airport used to be 11 p.m. till 6 a.m. People have accepted that that might come back to 12 p.m. to 5.00 a.m.; but we now have international operators scheduling flights to arrive at Sydney airport around 5 o'clock. The curfew is not supposed to be lifted until 5.30 a.m., but we have now got scheduled flights leaving Europe to arrive at 5.30 a.m. This is just a joke. But of course, Mr Deputy Speaker, once the second airport at Badgerys Creek is operational&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise a point of order. I do not want to put you in a difficult position&mdash;it is obviously something that needs to be sorted out between the government and the opposition&mdash;but this is absolutely stretching things to the limit, as did the speech by the honourable member for Werriwa. I am sure the chief government whip knows this. This has absolutely nothing to do with this legislation at all. Whilst it might be appropriate for an adjournment speech or a grievance debate or even a private member's bill, I think it is setting a very dangerous precedent to allow this committee to be used in that way. Whilst the subject&mdash;and I am prepared to debate it any time&mdash;is a very important one to the people of Sydney, I think it is starting to set a very dangerous precedent if this committee is to be regarded any differently as far as the procedures for debate are concerned from the main chamber of the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would have thought that the opposition whip might have known the legislation that was before the chamber. One of the bills that we are amending is the Urban and Regional Development (Financial Assistance) Act. That act allows the Commonwealth to agree with the states on various forms of Commonwealth assistance to be given for approved programs. One of those approved programs is the infrastructure that has been provided to go from Sydney airport to Badgerys Creek. I think what I am saying is precisely within the terms of the standing orders.</PARA></TALK.START>

I think you should take your colleague aside later and explain some of the finer points of these things. When your former colleague who is sitting opposite us here, the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson), was the government whip, we never had these sorts of interventions from the opposition in attempts to take up people's time. The honourable member for Isaacs was far more efficient at this job than the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, what we need to do when looking at the legislation we have here that talks about parts of the environment and talks about Commonwealth assistance to states for projects is to look at these big projects like Sydney airport. As my colleague the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins), the Deputy Speaker, said earlier, what Tom Uren had in mind with this sort of legislation when it was introduced in 1974 was that there would be some planning put into what happens with these big infrastructure programs around the major capitals of Australia because we cannot do these things in isolation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who live around those projects are the ones who suffer. The additional standard of living of all Australians is raised by increases in tourism but it is a trade-off. The sensible thing is to have a smaller operating airport in the centre of the city and the larger international operator out on the city rim. That is good management; that is good urban planning and that is the sort of thing that the Commonwealth ought to be encouraging the states to do. At Sydney airport I think we have seen a failure in that sort of process. Let us hope that the extension of Badgerys Creek can help that out. I thank the committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I want to acknowledge the contributions that have been made by various speakers. At the outset, I will limit my comments essentially to a discussion which was introduced into the debate by the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) and pursued to some extent by the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) about the relation of feral animals and exotic weeds to park management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contribution by the honourable member was a very interesting one and it raised some very important issues. I will respond in the context of acknowledging the role that is currently being played in park management by the Australian Nature Conservation Agency and, in particular, the efforts which are being made by the Commonwealth through ANCA to control feral animals and weeds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am speaking from experience, not only because of my involvement in the portfolio but also because I live in the Northern Territory and I have a lot to do with Kakadu and other national parks. The park on Christmas Island and the park on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands are both in my electorate. The only other two parks for which ANCA has direct responsibility in this context are at Jervis Bay and on Norfolk Island. I have to say that the highlight of the management strategies which have been implemented by the various park managers&mdash;at Kakadu by Peter Wellings, at Uluru by Bob Seaborne, on Christmas Island by Graham Beach, at Jervis Bay by John Williams, on Norfolk Island by Paul Stevenson and on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands by Geoff Tranter&mdash;is the way in which the issue of the control of feral animals and weeds has been addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought, listening to the speech made by the honourable member for Barker, that he was suggesting that the Commonwealth should accept some responsibility for national parks in a generic sense. Clearly, we have a responsibility to accept that we must manage those parks which are within our province&mdash;that is, the national parks which are controlled and administered by ANCA&mdash;in a way which is in the interests of the wider community, and we must adopt the most advanced management practices. It is clear that, whilst the Commonwealth presents a shining example of developing coordinated and cooperative management systems for the control of feral animals and weeds, that is not always the case with state and territory park managers. It appears that they do not always have the resources to deal with these particular problems, or they may choose to direct their resources elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of Kakadu, for example, there are three enormous problems which are being addressed currently by ANCA. The first one, which has received a great deal of prominence, is the question of feral buffalo. Since the feral buffalo program was put in place in Kakadu some 70,000 beasts have been removed. That is a large number. It is a joint Northern Territory and Commonwealth program which is almost complete. It was reviewed last year by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, which put up a considerable amount of money through the BTEC program, and the department found it to be very successful. The program now consists entirely of mopping up a small number of buffalo stragglers which were left over, using a very innovative method&mdash;one which has sometimes been used in caucus I think&mdash;that is, the `judas animal'. The judas animal is a buffalo, fitted with a radio collar, that is allowed to roam freely and in the process gathers other straggling buffaloes around it. I do not want to go too far with the analogy about the way in which parliamentary caucuses operate, but the herd is then shot from helicopters. The current program is being carried out by the Northern Territory Department of Primary Industry and Fisheries, with ANCA's cooperation and assistance. In summary, the buffalo eradication program is being carried out to the satisfaction of both the Northern Territory and Commonwealth governments and the review by DOPIE has confirmed the success of the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other significant program is in the area of weed control, particularly the eradication of Mimosa pigra and Salvinia molesta. The Mimosa pigra program is very important and has been very successful, and it continues to keep Kakadu National Park free of significant infestation. It is an ANCA program only in respect of Kakadu. Outside Kakadu to the east, in Arnhem Land on the Oenpelli flood plain, there is an ongoing program funded by the Commonwealth. The program is carried out with the full cooperation of the provisional landowners through the Northern Land Council, ANCA and the Northern Territory Department of Primary Industry and Fisheries and it has made significant inroads into a large infestation of Mimosa pigra. The program continues to be carried out with the full cooperation of all parties, including the Northern Territory government, and is expected to be fully successful. That is very important, because what is happening is that the program is operating in conjunction with the agencies in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other organisation which is involved in developing a biological control is the CSIRO. It has been doing a great deal of work, funded by the Commonwealth, for the release of a biological control of the Mimosa pigra infestation. ANCA has also funded the CSIRO to carry out significant research on integrated control of Salvinia molesta. The outcomes of the CSIRO's research are being implemented by way of integrated biological control with physical and chemical control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am raising these matters to point out to the honourable member for Barker that, whilst it is true that there are significant problems involved in national parks with feral animals and weeds, the fact is that the Commonwealth has adopted a very responsible attitude to the parks it manages and has implemented strategies to control these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the broad issue of feral animal controls, I think he is quite right. There is a great deal more to be done nationally for us to get a handle on feral pigs, for example, on rabbits and on the noxious weeds in the community. But it will be done only in cooperation with the various levels of government. It is not the Commonwealth's sole responsibility, but where the Commonwealth has responsibility, I think it has exercised it properly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last evening, when asked if I would speak on the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Bougainville, I had not had the opportunity to read it. Since then I have done a considerable amount of reading of it, and I found it very interesting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, a number of points in it were significant to me. The Chief of the Defence Force in Papua New Guinea, Brigadier-General Robert Dademo, and the Assistant Defence Adviser in the Australian section have actually both been at Portsea at the same time I was there. One of the areas that we had studied at that particular time in political studies was Bougainville, because way back in the early 1970s Bougainville had been an area of particular political significance. At the time Prime Minister Somare, the new Prime Minister of New Guinea, was looking at the implications of Bougainville, in particular its copper deposits and their significant financial implications for the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It concerned me to read Senator Stephen Loosley's comments in the preamble to the report, where he said that the delegation wished to record its concerns and distress at the news of the beating of Sir Paul Lapun and his family shortly after his visit to Bougainville. It appeared from the news reports that a gang of 15 armed men had attacked Sir Paul and his family and burned down his house in the mistaken belief that he had been given money by the Australian delegation. Sir Paul Lapun, a distinguished Bougainvillean, had simply made an eloquent appeal to the members of the delegation about the need for dialogue to begin among all parties to the conflict in an effort to find a solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess that sums up one of the difficulties with regard to Bougainville and some of the problem areas there. Australia proposed the visit as a background to the widespread concern not only in Australia but around the world about the conflict in Bougainville. We recognise, I think, that it is not an easy area to establish solutions in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the recommendations that have been proposed by the committee to try to establish and continue dialogue and to bring the groupings of people together to try to talk through some of the problems are an important factor. One of the difficulties and one of the things that probably concerns me most is the taking of lives as payback, if you like, that seems to have occurred over a considerable period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, when one looks back over this particular conflict and the five years of fighting, the duration of the fighting that has occurred is similar to the duration of the Second World War. It is significant that the conflict has gone on over that length of time. The longer it goes on, the more animosity between the groupings is likely to build up. We have seen many other parts of the world where animosities have developed and hatred has developed between groupings. The longer it has gone on, the more difficult it becomes to resolve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been impressed by the way the report has been put together by the delegation. I guess we could not have got a more diverse make-up for that. I think that is significant because what it does is provide for the members of parliament in this country&mdash;and I think it does it very well, from reading the report&mdash;a spread of views on the way that the conflict has developed and ways in which it can be handled. It is not only important for the parliament that we had that spread of representation but also it is important for the people of Papua New Guinea and for the people of Bougainville to understand that the document that has been put together by this delegation actually provides a very broad based view. It is significant because many of the people in Bougainville, I guess, may have had concerns that the presentation by the committee may have had biases, but I do not believe, given the make-up of that committee, that that holds any credence whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The biggest areas of concern that I have in the longer term are the number of schools that are currently closed and the port facilities that are limited, at best. The opportunities for advancement for these people are extremely limited at the moment. One would hope that the people who are fighting, irrespective of what side they are on, would consider the future generation. If they cannot get their act together in this generation to sort out the problems, they should at least think of the children and their opportunities for the future without an education and without the opportunities for decent hospital treatment. I note that the main hospital, which was considered one of the better hospitals in New Guinea before 1993, was burnt down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These things all lead to a degradation of the infrastructure that is necessary within any society. I would hope that, in the process of the work that needs to be done in this area, some emphasis can be placed on the parties involved being able to recognise that it is not only this generation that is suffering but the generations of the future. Education does need to be provided for development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report recommendations endeavour to bring the people together to discuss these issues. One of the suggestions in the report was that, although alternative means should be provided in Bougainville if at all possible, we should be prepared to look at Cairns as a possible location if that cannot be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important that Australia has tried to avoid direct intervention in this process. I think it is also important that we highlight the fact that, if the solution is to be found, it needs to be found by the people on the ground there. Ultimately, they are the people who are going to have to live with the decisions that are made. Solutions cannot, I believe, be made without their being involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also significant is the point that was made in the report regarding the reopening of the mines. There has been a lot of concern that people have only taken an interest because of the copper there and the dollar value that one could place on that copper. The point has been made that solutions should be found before that actually occurs. Clearly, if it is not done in that manner, then it could, and probably would, be said&mdash;certainly by many of the people in Bougainville who are opposed to the way that issues have been handled&mdash;that it was done purely for financial gains. My belief in this area is that the report is correct in trying to look at that issue and solve those problems before the financial rewards that may come out of the copper mines are in fact achieved. They must be solved in that manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the report. I think that the committee has done an excellent job in putting it together. I believe that it is a very difficult situation, and one that could create instability in an area where certainly we in Australia would least want it. We should, wherever possible, assist in trying to get the parties together to resolve the problem, without our pushing an Australian viewpoint on it, and I think that is in fact really highlighted by the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not really have a great deal more to say, except to conclude by saying that the way that the delegation has tackled this report, with the range of views that are in it, will do a great deal towards at least expressing a broadly based view to the community and to the people involved in this conflict, who may at some stage read this report. Hopefully, it will provide them with a good basis to look at it from a bipartisan Australian parliamentary viewpoint. </PARA>

When Vukovar was getting blown apart, she was in the situation of seeing people that she knew on the television. The atrocities, the bloodshed, the stupidity of killing other people, when there is nothing to gain, I find very hard to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we were over there in Bougainville, and when we came back and put this report together, we had, perhaps, high hopes that it would make a difference. But I read in the paper today that another three poor innocents have died. I do not care that they have got bloody khaki on and they are Papua New Guinea government soldiers&mdash;they are three innocent people who have died: for what?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken previously in the House about how I believe this erupted, and who I felt was responsible. I would suggest that not all, but probably some, of the others who were on this delegation disagreed with me on that. I put it down to greed and money, to lack of consultation and lack of respect&mdash;basic, honest respect for other people, whether they be villagers or managers of multinational companies. If people on a one-to-one basis do not respect other people then no deal can be brokered, no arrangement can be held. We are in a position where there are a whole lot of hidden agendas going on. I came back from this visit and, with Stephen Loosley, I spoke to the ACTU's international committee. They were happy to accept our report, because they knew that Stephen and I covered the gamut of politics on the Labor side. They knew that we were both sincere people who would not lie to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the offers that came from Wingti and Chan were on that basis. Chan had a very close association with Ian Sinclair, and they did not know me from a bar of soap. But I hope that the outcome of our meetings and our talks, some of which were in confidence, conveyed to them that we had a deep desire, not to make dollars out of the area, but to stop senseless, idiotic, stupid killings, and to give something back to those kids who have lost five years of their lives; perhaps they have lost their future. They understood that we really were talking about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would now seem that that has all gone. Whose agenda is it? Who is pushing it? There were those who, perhaps, advised people not to negotiate peace, because there was some hope held up that the United Nations would intervene, that the Security Council would intervene. I know that these things have been said to the people on the BRA side. I believe that the people who said that to them said it in the context of well-meaning advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have got to be frank. I am often criticised because I say that sometimes bleeding hearts get in the way of a sensible solution. I am often criticised because sometimes I say that you have to cop it sweet and that you have got to have a position. What are the people on Bougainville after? My goal in being involved in this whole thing is to allow them to have a dignified, free lifestyle and to stop the bloodshed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just for the record, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 25 August 1994 says that Papua New Guinea forces have occupied Panguna. So what? Anyone who believes that a military solution can be achieved in Bougainville is nuts. During the Second World War many of the people from my area were actually involved in the fighting in Papua New Guinea. One uncle of mine was there and another uncle flew over the top of it. There were thousands of Japs on one side of the island and thousands of Americans on the other side, and they could not do anything with each other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is going to happen? We are going to have a festering sore in this country. We are going to have kids who for the next 15 to 20 years will be paying the price for some other people's idiocy, and for what? If only I could see some goal; if only I could see that they will get something out of this. I am not a coward and I am not a pacifist: I am a peace activist. I have said it before in this place and I will say it again: if you hit me in the face once, I will say, `Stop'; if you hit me in the face twice, I will say, `You'd better stop'; if you hit me in the face a third time, I will take your head off. I am not one of the people who believes that there is no recourse to violence. If our country is invaded I will volunteer in front of my sons, because I do not want them to get involved, but I cannot see what is to be attained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some people in this country who will object to what I am about to say, but I will say it anyway. There was a protracted revolution on the island of Bougainville. Those who won the revolution had 90 per cent support and then, because people went around blowing innocent people's heads off, they lost that support. That is sheer idiocy. The people of the island should be its legitimate controllers. There was a little window of opportunity; for a fleeting moment it was there. There was a chance that these people could have grabbed hold of peace, but it slipped through their fingers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know that there is any further contribution that I can make. I do not say that with any feeling of pride; I say it with a sense of failure. I can only use this opportunity to make a plea to Prime Minister Paias Wingti, to Deputy Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan and to Francis Ona. I say to them: `You are three human beings. Cut your titles out and you are the same as I was before 13 March. You are just ordinary people. For God's sake, have some compassion for those kids. Have some compassion for the women in the area who are dying from preventable diseases and from giving birth to babies. Have some compassion for the future of the people who are going to have to live together.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the idiocies that I find about the conflict in former Yugoslavia&mdash;Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, call it whatever you bloody like, I do not care what you call it&mdash;is that those people have lived side by side for 1,000 years. They have been neighbours for 1,000 years, and for the next 1,000 years they are going to sit side by side. When are we going to find a situation when people start looking ahead and saying, `These people are going to be my neighbours for 1,000 years, why don't I sit down and start doing something about having some respect for their rights,' and dealing with it in that manner? Until that happens the Bosnia-Herzegovinas, the Rwandas and the Bougainvilles are just going to keep going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would love a `Peace for 2000' movement to start.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I supported this report as a very good and honest approach in that window of opportunity to bring about peace. I can stand before you people and the Australian people and say that my whole goal was to try and get a peaceful settlement with respect for all. But I have got to say to you that this is an historical document; and whilst everything was pertinent and right and correct when it was brought down, I think it has had its day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless these people want to stop bloodshed, unless they want to stop idiotic killings of people and deaths that is unwarranted, then I am afraid that an historical document is all this will ever be. Maybe I have wasted my time; but what I say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, is that to try and save a life is worthwhile. If I had been able to achieve this and then stayed here for another 50 years, it might have been the biggest thing that I ever achieved. Unfortunately, that is not the case. I just plead with the people who are involved: talk peace, not war&mdash;if you do not, you are losing the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I address the contents of the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Bougainville, like the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) I want to say that this is the first occasion I have been in this Main Committee. I take the opportunity to congratulate the Chairman of Committees and his deputies, the clerks, and the whips on both sides of the House. I think it is a worthwhile initiative and I think it will, over the coming months and for the remainder of this sitting year, go from strength to the strength that it clearly deserves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of this report, I would like first of all to congratulate a number of people. I agree with previous speakers that the members of the delegation were clearly a very diverse group. I want to congratulate Senator Loosley, the leader of the delegation and my colleague in the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I think that Senator Loosley here and elsewhere continues to make a major contribution in those portfolio areas, with a great deal of bipartisanship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also congratulate the deputy leader of that group, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). During the visit Mr Sinclair showed his experience as a previous minister for defence, and his great experience in dealing at the diplomatic level with lots of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Vicki Bourne I congratulate also, and I am sure she made a very worthwhile contribution during the visit to that troubled island, as did Senator Paul Calvert and, of course&mdash;last but by no means least&mdash;the previous speaker, the honourable member for Gilmore. I understand the emotion that he generated this morning. Having visited the island of Bougainville&mdash;and I will talk about that in a moment&mdash;I can understand what he is saying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I am delighted that Margaret Swieringa is sitting in here. I think the delegation is only as good as its support and I am pleased to see her here. I am sure she made a very worthwhile contribution on the ground and also, very importantly, in the formal preparation of what is a very worthwhile report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The visit was clearly a successful one. But as the honourable member for Gilmore has said, it will be only as successful as the Papua New Guinea government allows it to be. I do not agree with everything that he said. Nevertheless, I think he made a very valid point in saying that the initiative lies very squarely at the feet of the government of PNG. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not take the time of the committee for very long this morning, but I think it is worth reading into the record the opening to the synopsis of the report, because it encapsulates everything that the delegation set out to achieve. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The war on Bougainville has lasted for over five years. It has cost many lives, destroyed infrastructure, dislocated life on the island and yet attempts to find a solution for the crisis appear to have reached an impasse. A military solution is not possible for either side, but without political resolve&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this takes up the point of the honourable member for Gilmore&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">there is the likelihood that the conflict and the suffering of the Bougainvillean people will continue indefinitely. Finally, the conflict has the potential to drain Papua New Guinea of its resources, to undermine its unity and to damage its international reputation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Events on Bougainville are vital to the stability of Papua New Guinea and ultimately to the region. Australia's interest in Papua New Guinea, its prosperity and its stability, is longstanding and continuing.</PARA>
<PARA>It is important that we reinforce that point and include it in the record of this committee. I think the visit was successful. To understand why it was successful, honourable members do not have to go any further than to read the foreign minister's response, the government response, to this report. In part, Senator Evans said this:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation's visit has been very successful in two important respects. The first of these is having provided an authoritative eyewitness account of the current situation on Bougainville and in providing the Australian parliament and the Australian community with access to the views of ordinary Bougainvillean men and women, unfiltered by spokespersons seeking to promote the views or cause of any one side. The delegation makes clear in its report its overwhelming impression that the people of Bougainville, above all, desire peace and a return to normal life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In doing so the report also helps to dispel some of the misrepresentations which propagandists have promoted, especially here in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Evans further stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the delegation visit has, I think, itself served to encourage renewed Papua New Guinean efforts to seek out a peaceful solution. This report provides useful suggestions as to how a peace process might develop on the PNG side while at the same time stating a possible basis for an appropriate Australian contribution to the process. It does not lay down a prescriptive, detailed blueprint for peace; it does clarify the very real issues that do need to be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that the foreign minister has hit the nail on the head and that this has been a successful visit. However, once again I have to agree with what the honourable member for Gilmore said, that it will only be successful in the medium to longer term if the government of PNG has the will to do something about the real problem that exists in Bougainville. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at the way ahead, again Senator Evans made some good points. I think it is worth reading into the record of this committee what he said in two paragraphs of the government response, because once again I think it encapsulates exactly where we should be heading and perhaps where PNG should be heading. He said this:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those parties who remain opposed to Papua New Guinea sovereignty in the North Solomons are faced with a choice: to continue pursuing their political objectives through violence and intimidation, or to set these aside in the interests of allowing ordinary Bougainvilleans to resume their normal lives, to educate their children, to cultivate their food gardens, to plant their crops, and to travel freely. Compromise must be seen to come from all sides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the government's sincere hope that the delegation's report will encourage all those involved in the Bougainville situation to think more seriously about peace and about the steps needed to bring it about, and to take at least the first of those steps without waiting for others to set the pace. The government has, in this respect, welcomed the recent confirmation by Papua New Guinea Foreign Minister, Sir Julius Chan, that he has held discussions with South Pacific nations on ways in which they might help to bring an end to the conflict. It may be that, depending on the task envisaged, Australia could play a role in supporting a small regional peacekeeping force, established to facilitate a peace process. This has not yet been put to us as a detailed proposal, and we await further elaboration of the concept. We would certainly consider any such proposal very sympathetically.</PARA>
<PARA>I think those comments have a lot to attract the attention and the support of this House. I was very concerned in reading the report because although it is a long time since I have been to Bougainville, perhaps 10 or 12 years, what I did see in reading the report was the disaster that clearly is Bougainville. When I was there, Arawa port was a bustling port, the Panguna mine was open and working, and the people in that area were a bustling community. Clearly, all of that has been destroyed. In particular, as the report sets out, there have been problems with human rights atrocities. The degree of those, of course, is debatable, but nevertheless it is clear that there have been certain atrocities on both sides of the camp of conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of health, I notice that the report made the point that in the three years between 1990 and 1993 over 500 people died of disease which could have been avoided had the facilities been there. I also note that 60 schools remain closed. That, of course, is not in the interest of PNG children, and the future of PNG lies very firmly with its youth. Also the report made the point that the infrastructure&mdash;the roads, the airfields et cetera&mdash;has been degraded to a point where a lot of money will have to be spent to re-establish it to the level at which it should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to take up the time of the committee unnecessarily, but I will make a couple of final points. It is in Australia's strategic and security interests that we have stability to the north, and of course Papua New Guinea is an important element in that regional stability. This report makes very valid points. It provides an appropriate set of leads both for this government and, more importantly, for the government of Papua New Guinea. But I reaffirm and reiterate what the honourable member for Gilmore said in his contribution to this debate: it will only happen if the people and the government of New Guinea have the will to make it happen&mdash;and that perhaps has had some setbacks in recent days and weeks&mdash;but the onus lies fairly and squarely with that government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like also to congratulate the government of Papua New Guinea, particularly Prime Minister Wingti and foreign minister, Sir Julius Chan, obviously during this delegation visit and recently, although a lot still has to be done. I also would like to congratulate the staff of the High Commission in Port Moresby, from the High Commissioner down. Clearly, from reading the report, without them the visit would not have been possible because of the very demanding and very dangerous conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, I commend this report to the committee. It has a lot to offer and I hope that this country will be given the opportunity to provide further support in the appropriate areas that are highlighted in the report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, because this is my first opportunity to speak in this new committee, I wish to say how much I welcome its introduction into the parliament. I also extend my thanks to you for your work, supported by the Speaker and others in the parliament, in helping to establish it. I first saw a committee such as this in the House of Commons some years ago when I represented the Victorian parliament. I was very impressed with its ability to scrutinise legislation in an informal manner and in a very effective way which involved the ministers, the parliamentary secretaries, the shadow ministers and, in the case of the day I was with the committee of the House of Commons, the permanent head of the department. So that was an interesting amalgam of people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also very happy to be able to make a brief contribution in support of this report, as a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. It gives me a chance to pay a tribute to Senator Loosley, the chair of that committee. He brings all of us together from the various political colours in a very skilful way. I must say it is a pleasure to participate in that committee. It has also been a pleasure for me, as a very new member of this parliament, to see the colour, talent and experience of the various members of that committee and, indeed, the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the father of the House, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), played a very important part in this delegation to Papua New Guinea. I never cease to be amazed, whenever I travel around Australia with the right honourable member for New England, to see the number of people visiting here from all over the world who know him and come up to him. He instantly recognises them and immediately they are able to find some common denominator. His knowledge, which he imparts to all of us, in what I might say is a very humble way, is important to the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also interesting today for me to hear the contribution of my colleague the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson). It never ceases to amaze me how a parliament which is made up of so many diverse people can bring together so much experience and talent. The honourable member for Isaacs was confiding to us today that, during his time of officer training as a professional soldier in Australia, he trained with Robert Dademo, who is now the Commander-in-Chief of the PNG defence forces. They were young soldiers together, and here today we see one of those colleagues speaking about the Bougainville situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The points that have been mentioned by the previous speakers have covered important areas of the report which I would have referred to, so I am not going to go over those again. I was pleased to see the report is a unanimous report and one would expect to see, under Senator Loosley's chairmanship and a certain secretary's skilful, crafted writing, that the report would come out and reflect the views of everyone. The report is terribly important because it virtually is, as far as I can understand, the first significant report about a serious situation in Bougainville by representatives of the Australian parliament. It also provides a very sensible foundation for future action, without attempting to impose Australia's opinion or will on the people of PNG and Bougainville. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the suggestions about a series of community meetings, to bring people together and to enable them to put their views, will ultimately culminate in a conference, in Cairns or perhaps somewhere else. Above all, it should be held in a place where the people of PNG-Bougainville feel comfortable and relaxed. I hope that it will occur. Even though three people were unfortunately killed yesterday in an ambush, and even though we realise that problems arise constantly&mdash;almost daily&mdash;we must not lose faith or hope that the recommendations of the committee will eventually lead to a conference and to ongoing discussions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I am not able to say what we talked about at the meeting this morning of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, we had representatives from Israel speaking to us about the long process of peace. They spoke about how, although peace has not yet been achieved, significant progress has certainly been made and how Yasser Arafat is seen in a different light now from the one in which he was seen some years ago. I think we ought to draw some hope from the fact that if everyone of goodwill works together and maintains a common goal, eventually they will succeed, as will, I am sure, the government and the people of PNG and Bougainville. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my contribution I want to record in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> some of the comments made by the people themselves to the delegation when the delegation was welcomed and when it left. I think that will provide some perspective and some balance to today's excellent contributions by the other speakers. Nick Peniai, who is Chairman of the South West Interim Authority, made a speech when the delegation arrived on 21 April. All of his speech should be read&mdash;it is in the report&mdash;but there are some points that struck me as being significant and as giving a lead. He talked about things that could be done by Australia and by others to help. On page 64 of the report his speech says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, we believe that this essential area of activity must now be supplemented by other activities as a pre-requisite to establishing a sound economic base for South West District. In this we are seeking the goodwill of people like yourselves, Australian Government agencies or donor agencies for that matter to actualise our visions.</PARA>
<PARA>I love that `actualise our visions'&mdash;that is nice. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have for some time now contemplated the establishment of some light industries suited to our environment and able to provide labour and employment to our youth.</PARA>
<PARA>We have got a bit in common there, have we not? Mr Peniai continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These range from manufacture of clothing for the tropics, soft drinks, light vehicle maintenance, workshops, car sales and steel fabrication plant.</PARA>
<PARA>I have a lot of friends in Australia in industry and commerce and in service groups and I am going to take that back to them. I honestly believe that there are a lot of people in Australia in the private sector and in the volunteer community who would like to know that, and who could go over there and perhaps help to introduce and develop some of the activities which lead to employment, economic growth, stability and, of course, the opportunity for people to lift themselves out of poverty. Nick Peniai continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We submit that the transfer of appropriate technology and knowledge is a vital obligation of the industrialised West. We therefore urge you to take cognisance of our muted requests so that we can ford the rivers of incompatibility together into the 21st century.</PARA>
<PARA>He also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those who choose to remain in the bush have vowed to fight to the last man. For what reasons, we do not know. But one thing we do know of is that their refusal to come out and join us to work together is based on the hatred that they have for individual Bougainvilleans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To bury the hatchets as it were and to look forward to a new day of hope, of peace and of prosperity.</PARA>
<PARA>They are very appropriate words, but they indicate some of the problems that have yet to be tackled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another speech was from Thomas Anis, chairman of the Buka Interim Authority and spokesperson for the chiefs and other leaders of the North Solomons Province. I thought his input was very important, too, because he obviously knows a lot about the North Solomons history and some of the problems that need to be taken into account in trying to find peace in that area. I am reading from page 71. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this regard, the chiefs and the people of the North Solomons Province see the current arrangements of power sharing between the National Government and the province as the ideal basis for discussions on a lasting solution to the Bougainville crisis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .       . . .      . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is our honest conviction that no amount of force and physical confrontation will enable us to address these issues and other issues which gave rise to the problems which have devastated our lives and the lives of our children.</PARA>
<PARA>He referred, in conclusion, to Australia's special role in helping to achieve all of those matters. I welcome the report. It is a very good report. I congratulate the members of the delegation and the staff and I look forward to chapter 2, which inevitably will occur&mdash;we hope, very soon. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following an inquiry which began in November 1992, the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA) made a number of recommendations on the Corporation's aeronautical and non-aeronautical charges to the Government in August 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government considered the PSA's report in the context of a broader review of the FAC's performance, pricing and capital structure and accepted the broad thrust of the PSA's recommendations. The Prime Minister's `Working Nation' statement of 4 May 1994 announced that the Government would introduce reforms to improve the FAC's investment and pricing decisions. These reforms will be achieved through the phased introduction of economically efficient pricing principles. The practical implementation of these reforms will be considered as part of the scoping study into the possible sale of Federal airports.</PARA>

<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Completed</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>3. The procedures for creating and maintaining program information, including who had the delegation to perform these functions, should be documented and communicated to the relevant officers.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Completed</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>4. Sufficient procedures should be set in place to ensure adequate segregation of duties (between creation of a program category in PASS and certification of payments) occurs. These procedures should ensure that persons who can create a new program category cannot also certify claims.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Completed</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>5. We recommend that signatures should be provided with Instruments of Delegations supplied by the Program areas to the PASS Team. Instruments of Delegations should contain the position numbers associated with the maximum amount that a person may approve.</PARA>

<PARA>7. That FINEST notify PASS users of any changes to the supplier file which have an impact upon the PASS provider file.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Completed</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>8. A single Departmental supplier file or an arrangement which achieves the objectives of a single supplier file be used for all applications within the Department.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Work is under way to improve the quality of data within the supplier files for all financial systems. This is due to be completed in late August 1994 and ongoing data integrity checks are currently being developed.</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>

<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Completed</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>10. A project should be recorded on PASS prior to or on the day of commencement. Given that a contract creates financial obligations, a project should be created before its commencement date so that payments to clients and providers can be made promptly.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Completed</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>11. A table be maintained in PASS specifying the maximum period after commencement for which a project may be created within a particular labour market program. This function will not allow the PASS user to create a project exceeding the maximum period specified by the table.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Completed</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>12. An ageing report should be produced indicating projects that have been modified over 3 months after the commencement date of the project.

<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Completed</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>13. Project approval should occur prior to the commencement date of the project to ensure that the correct commencement date has been entered.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>

<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>14. There may be circumstances where the information used to set up a project in PASS is incorrect for a range of reasons, such as incorrect keying or renegotiation of the terms of the contract. A modification facility may be required to allow modification of the project details. The use of this modify function should require the re-application of the approve function, with the appropriate segregation between the officers who perform the modify and approve functions.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Completed</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>15. PASS should not permit users to create projects years into the future. Projects should not be created in PASS more than 12 months before their commencement dates.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Completed</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>16. Segregation of duties should be implemented between the create/modify function and the authorisation function, to ensure that the creation or modification of a provider are bonafide.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>This will be addressed as part of the development of a corporate client file.</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>17. At the creation of an additional project record for a provider a manual override is available. An audit log should be available to track and report on these occurrences. A second override should be required if the project details are identical.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Completed</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>18. Providers who fail to acquit by the due date should not receive any further contracts. The PASS system be modified such that the creation of any other financial obligations against a provider is not possible until acquittal has been carried out.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Not completed. Controls are being introduced to the extent practicable to prevent further payments in respect of the contract for which the acquittal was outstanding.</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>19. The responsibility for implementing these recommendations rests jointly with the Assistant Secretary, Information Systems Development Branch and Assistant Secretary, Planning and Performance Branch. Program managers in the network are to be made aware of this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Completed</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>20. We recommend that PASS be modified such that overpayments are recovered from any labour market program which the provider is involved in.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Completed</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>21. That the feasibility of providing a facility to record and track under and over acquittals be undertaken. It would enable the certifying officer to make an informed decision about making subsequent payments to a provider. ideally such a system should indicate when a payment to a provider is to be stopped. The responsibility for ensuring that this recommendation is implemented rests with the Assistant Secretary, Information Systems Development Branch.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Completed</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>22. We recommend monitoring the extent to which manual calculations for regular payments occur, particularly where such calculations exceed the amount calculated by PASS.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Completed</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>23. Consideration should be given to incorporating a function within PASS that will not allow a PASS user to modify Formal Training Allowance (FTA) or wage subsidy commitment beyond the maximum calculated  by PASS.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Completed</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>24. We recommend that PASS be changed so that all advance payments are properly flagged for future acquittals.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Completed</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>25. Extension of the placement beyond the originally approved cessation date should require the placement to be reapproved. The reapproval requires segregation of duties between modify and approve functions, consistent with the creation of the original placement.</PARA>
<PARA>Internal Audit notes that currently an extension requires reapproval; however this function is performed by a single officer, which does not reflect an appropriate control regime. Internal Audit accepts that a single officer may vary the cessation date to shorten the period of the placement.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Completed</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>26. The report "Listing of Placements Open Beyond their Planned End Date" should be reviewed at relevant Regional or Area Offices and feedback given to PASS or Program Management stating the reasons for delays in closing placements. On the basis of reviewing the ageing report produced by PASS, PASS management could consider the appropriate period in which a placement can remain open.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Completed</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>27. Internal Audit notes that Employment Programs and Services Division (EPSD) is reviewing its reporting structure, which currently focuses on the Operational Plan, Newstart and Financial Planning. Within this review, EPSD should consider the inclusion of information on placements open beyond their planned end date, disaggregated by State and Program as part of the monthly expenditure report. It is noted that this report should go to the Budget Monitoring Committee and to the Executive.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Completed</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>28. Internal Audit recommends that consideration be given to a number of measures to ensure reconciliation of DSS and PASS data including:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) the inclusion of a tape beginning and end messages, or using a hash total to ensure complete and accurate transmission;</PARA>
<PARA>(b) creation of a stack in DEET recording all information dispatched to DSS from PASS. Data dispatched from DSS to PASS should be matched with the data in the stack. Where matches occur the data should be deleted from the stack. Where the DSS record does not match a record in the stack, the record should be included in an exception report. These mismatched records should be investigated or returned to the DSS. Periodically, at least weekly, an ageing report on data in the stack greater than two weeks old should be provided to identify those records not included in DSS tapes for follow up with the DSS.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Completed</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>29. The OCES code should be incorporated with each record on the PASS to DSS tape in such a way that error reports can be targeted to particular offices for correction.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Completed</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>30. The gross amount paid by DSS should be passed through the interface transaction file and be reflected in PASS records. That is, the gross amount should be recorded in FINEST and against the client record in PASS.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Completed</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>31. Internal Audit strongly supports the current efforts being made to correct the errors that have been made. We also recommend that FINEST reconciliation procedures be implemented so that detection of these errors and timely correction of them can take place.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Completed</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>32. Procedures should be developed and implemented to ensure that reconciliation is performed to ensure that information received by PASS from JOBSYSTEM is both complete and accurate.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Completed</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>33. Segregation of duties should be implemented between registering changes to payee details and certification. This segregation should be enforced across systems, including PASS/JOBSYSTEM. Consideration should be given to elimination of the capacity to vary Jobseeker details in PASS.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Completed</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>34. Active clients in PASS should be retained in JOBSYSTEM until they have been archived in PASS.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Completed</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>35. Regular reconciliation of the two databases should occur in order to ensure the equivalence of common data held in both JOBSYSTEM and PASS.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Completed</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>36. That PASS be reconciled to FINEST on a monthly basis to ensure that the payments received by FINEST are complete and accurate.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Completed</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>37. The remaining ACF2 based logons be located and deleted. The responsibility for ensuring that this recommendation is implemented rests with the Assistant Secretary, Information Systems Development Branch.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Completed</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>38. Procedures should be developed so that the number of logons deleted and existing are recorded.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Completed</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>39. We recommend that a review of PASS users should occur at least annually. This review should ensure that all users are authorised and that their level of access is appropriate to their position.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Completed</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>40. User IDs should be checked against NOMAD to determine if they are still current. Those User IDs that have not been used for at least three months should be deactivated.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Completed</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>41. Corporate Services Division in consultation with System Division's Security Section should develop a Departmental separation checklist to ensure access to Department systems and other relevant matters are addressed at the time of separation. This may also be extended to address movement of staff within the Department.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Completed</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>42. The audit reports generated from PASS should be altered so that they are useable by State and Area office management. Given that, in some circumstances, it can take many months for a project to be created, audit reports covering two months are inadequate. PASS Management may need to store less data for longer periods for the purpose of audit reports.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Completed</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>43. PASS Management continue to monitor, evaluate and correct faults in PASS reports. PASS management should consider the ongoing use of SAS programs to examine the accuracy of reports once reports are in the production environment.</PARA>
<PARA>Status as at 1 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA>Completed</PARA>
<PARA>No. Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>44. In addition, PASS management should promulgate the need for budget information to be entered so that Performance Indicator reports are meaningful. Unless information relating to targets are inputed, the reports using this information are meaningless.</PARA>
