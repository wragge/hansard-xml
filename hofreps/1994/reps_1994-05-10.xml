<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is our intention with this amendment to clarify the fact that one of the people on the finance committee should be appointed on the nomination of stevedoring employers and that one should be a person appointed on the nomination of the Maritime Union of Australia. This is balanced and fair. Later in these discussions on the bill we will debate the number of members of the committee who are required to approve a particular action or delegate powers. The bill specifies that only three of the four are necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to us that the bill is unfairly structured. The employers believe&mdash;and, I believe, rightly&mdash;that their rights to represent their interests are under attack in accordance with this bill. It might well be that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton), who is at the table, might do absolutely the right thing and agree to the nomination of the employers' organisation and appoint the person that the employers would expect to be appointed to the finance committee. We would applaud that. But the minister might change. This government has rather a stark reputation for changing responsibilities, which has been well demonstrated in the last few months now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I admit that we have had a stable minister for industrial relations following the 13 March 1993 election and he has been in that position for some time. I also note newspaper reports that the minister moved heaven and earth to divest himself of his responsibilities for IR. I understand that. If I were in the minister's shoes, having brought down the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993, driven it through this parliament, had it passed and seen it ensconced in the law of the Commonwealth of Australia, I might well like to be rid of my responsibilities as Minister for Industrial Relations as well, because that act is a nightmare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have debated in this House the value of benefits&mdash;or otherwise&mdash;of this bill, the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill. We started out opposing the bill, notwithstanding debate and very good arguments by members of the government, both frontbench and backbench. Notwithstanding that, we remain diametrically opposed to this bill for two very strong reasons. One is the possibility of the reintroduction of a register. The second is the control of the industry agenda by persons outside the industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join my colleague the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) in speaking about the amendment. I will make a few quick points. We have moved the amendment to this very important aspect of the bill because we believe it is important that there be no risk that employers of waterfront labourers not be represented properly on this committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way the bill is structured currently, it is possible for the committee to be made up of a chairperson appointed by the minister, somebody from the department appointed by the minister, the MUA representative and a person who is nominally representing an employer of waterside workers but who could also be within the MUA structure. That possibility exists through a business called Federated Stevedores&mdash;which I am sure the minister is familiar with. It operates out of Darwin. When I visited it some years ago it was being run by a fellow called Manskie, who was a great character. He won Tattslotto the week after I visited him. He won $500,000 and then retired, having got his redundancy payment. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to have the same effect on most people I visit. He got his $100,000-odd redundancy package and Tattslotto in the same month, so he was very happy. It was possible for him to be considered an employer of waterside labour. It was then possible for the minister to appoint him as representing waterside employers. As a result, we want to ensure there is no ambiguity. That is why we have moved the amendment. It concerns the nomination of stevedoring employers. We have not mentioned the AEWL because it represents stevedoring employers in most cases, but it is worth while making the point that not all stevedoring employers are members of the AEWL&mdash;Conaust is the notable exception.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have said that this aspect of the bill should enable us to ensure that the nomination is representative of stevedoring employers and does not enable a second MUA representative to sneak in through the backdoor onto the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee. It is a very important part of the waterfront because one of the costs that Australian importers and exporters face in using the Australian waterfront are the levies collected by the SIFC. It is important that we have the best possible representation on that committee. For that reason we wanted to tidy up this ambiguity to ensure that all stevedore employers are represented and not give the MUA a chance to have another representative on the committee at the expense of representation from stevedore employers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the view in respect of these sorts of bodies that the minister of the day should have a reasonable amount of discretion in who is appointed. Clearly, the appointments should come from the industry parties. If we are to get the most appropriate people at all times, I think at the end of the day we do need an element of ministerial discretion. This bill, in its present form, enables a minister and future ministers to make appointments from those sectors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The spectre has been raised that the views of interested parties will not be taken into account. Let me assure the House in this debate that the contrary will be the case. We will ensure that there is an opportunity for industry groups to put forward panels of appropriate people for consideration to these appointments. The rights of employers are certainly not under attack, as has been suggested by the opposition. There will be no chance of this bill leading to a situation where there is union dominance of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make it absolutely clear that this will not enable a second MUA nominee to be appointed to the four-member committee, as has been suggested by the opposition. I would see me and future ministers simply having the discretion to make a decision based upon picking the most appropriate people to represent the different industry sectors. I think the bill in its present form provides that discretion. I think future ministers' discretion would be limited by the amendment being put forward, which would mean that the minister of the day would be more of a rubber stamp than someone exercising final discretion in saying who is best to constitute the committee, but recognising at all times that they must come from the industry sector. Accordingly, we do not agree to the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have noted the comments of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) and I have taken them on board. But I point out to the minister that, if we examine the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, the AIRC, and its present make-up, we find that very gradually over the past 10 years the even-handed balance that has always been apparent in representation on that commission has been eroded. So what we have today is an independent Industrial Relations Commission&mdash;which relates to this issue by the way&mdash;that has an overload of employee representatives as people who came from the ACTU or direct from unions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is that the minister might well act with good discretion. In no-one's eyes would I impugn the motives of the minister or his desire to do absolutely the right thing by the industry and all parties to it. I am certain that he would act with honour. Nonetheless, it is possible for the minister to make a judgment about who represents the industry which is different from the view of the industry itself. It seems to me that it is eminently sensible that we specify in legislation that employers and employees, through their representative bodies and their elective procedures, decide on the most appropriate person to sit as their representative on this important finance committee to make very important decisions, which we will discuss with respect to other amendments to this bill. I encourage the minister to take our comments on board and accept our amendment to his bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have indicated that I will be inviting the AEWL to put forward its suggestions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point has been made about appointments to the commission.

It represented a very balanced approach. I think when we look back at the workings of the commission at the end of this year we will see just how balanced and progressive it has been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will be absolutely no different.

<PARA>This is a very important amendment. This amendment, which will modify the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill, still allows the committee to raise levies. In our view, the raising of levies is tied to the concept of a register, of a job pool, which is no longer appropriate. We are concerned&mdash;on behalf of the entire industry and, in fact, on behalf of those who use the shipping services around Australia, those who pay the bills&mdash;that there be no reintroduction of any register. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only reason for raising levies is so that employees who are pooled under the register, and for whom there is no work, will have income. So the levy may be on a single employer, in fact, if the industry body decided that that employer needed a pool for that employer's employees. We made this point again and again during debate on the bill. But it is important that the minister understands our absolute determination that the concept of pooling and the concept of industry levies be removed, even as a remote possibility, from the legislation that we are considering today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the minister to give us in his response to this opposition amendment an absolute undertaking that, firstly, there will be no further inquiry into the waterfront industry and that, secondly, there will be no reintroduction of pooling. I would be loath to stand here and predict the words that will come from the minister's mouth, but I suspect that we will not receive a positive response to my request. In other words, I suspect that the minister will fail to give an absolute undertaking that, firstly, there will be no further inquiry into the waterfront industry and that, secondly, there will be no reintroduction of pooling. This is a very important issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister should welcome our amendment to his bill. It will clarify once and for all that the industry finance committee can decide when to stop a levy, cut it off, finish it and say, `That is the end of it forever,' but that it will have no power to reinstitute any levy with respect to the waterfront industry. That is the point. This amendment will make it absolutely clear that the committee no longer has the power to raise the levy. So I encourage the minister to respond positively, to give us an undertaking and to accept my amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton), in his remarks just a few moments ago, said that the SIFC would not be adding any further levies or increasing levies in the future. I think that is an accurate reporting of what he said. If that is the case, the amendments that have been moved by the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) would assist him in clarifying that matter. Our amendment is effectively removing all the various elements of the proposed sections of the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill and replacing them with the following words:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to make recommendations to the Minister as to when a levy should cease to apply . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The operative words are `should cease to apply'. If the minister wants to make what he just told the House a few moments ago compatible with the legislation, then this is the clearest and easiest way to do that. It takes all the ambiguity out of the issue and leaves the SIFC and the waterfront industry generally in the full knowledge that, as soon as those redundancy payments have been paid for through the existing levies collections, there will be no further levy. I think that is a very good argument for the opposition to put to the minister. I think it would be very useful for the minister to accept this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The waterfront reform process started back in September 1984, I think, when we had the Webber inquiry into the waterfront. It went on from there for about two years. We then had the Inter-State Commission inquiry, which was finalised on 1 April 1989, I think. The honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), who was the minister responsible for transport at the time, made a speech on 1 June 1989 announcing the subsequent establishment of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority at the end of September in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole purpose and driving influence behind all of this waterfront reform, in which we have invested $430 million, plus a great deal of time, effort and energy, is to try to break the waterfront industry down from being an industry-wide organisation to an enterprise by enterprise organisation so that the cost of the inefficiencies in one stevedoring firm would not have to be carried by another and, therefore, a more competitive environment would be created for those stevedores to operate in and loyalty to the employer would also be created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the old days, if a wharfie were asked whom he worked for, he would say, `I work for the Waterside Workers Federation.' There was no loyalty to the firm and, hence, nobody had an interest in the viability and the prosperity of the firm. There was also no responsibility. We have tried to break down the whole structure of our waterfront reform, on which we have spent all this money in order to make our waterfront more efficient and less costly, into an enterprise by enterprise organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of doing away with these levies is the final stage in achieving the initial goal that was set in 1989. If the minister wants to ensure that the words he gave us a few moments ago are carried out&mdash;an absolute, watertight guarantee&mdash;then the amendment we are putting forward should be supported. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that we do not see the need for any new or additional levies, we do not, either, see the need to unnecessarily limit the recommendations that the committee may wish to put to the government. It is a tripartite committee, after all. It may make recommendations to the government on any number of matters during the course of its remaining life, but the important thing that everyone must understand is that they are only recommendations. It is the government that must make a decision and any decision on new or additional levies will be made by the government. Under this provision, only recommendations could be placed before the government; the government would make the final decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed additional provision, which allows for the committee to make recommendations to the minister as to when a levy should cease to apply, is already encompassed in the current act. I have heard the opposition say, in the course of the consideration in detail stage, that it sees this provision as being tied to the whole question of a register and jobs pools on the waterfront. I do not envisage any return to jobs pools and I have made that abundantly clear in everything I have said. I think I have said it four or five times. Lest there be any doubt, I will repeat what I said in the House on 23 March. The amendments to the Stevedoring Industry Levy Act do not signal a return to labour pools. We do not envisage any labour pools. They are not on our agenda at all. But a register to meet our international obligations certainly is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also heard the opposition ask: will there be an inquiry? I have made it clear that I believe the appropriate way for industrial relations and the whole enterprise bargaining process to be advanced on the waterfront is to take advantage of section 133 of the act. Section 133 provides for industry consultative committees&mdash;that is, committees comprising employer and employee representatives, brought together by the commission so that these things can be sorted out between the parties and not at a government level. </PARA>

I suspect, and the employers suspect, that this bill we are debating today will allow the whole waterfront reform process to slip backwards also, just as the government is letting our economic reform slip backwards.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would just like to respond very briefly to the remarks of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) when he said, `This is our reform that we have achieved.' It has been the most extraordinarily expensive reform process, with somewhat dubious results. Even though we have had a substantial reduction in the number of waterside employees on the Australian waterfront&mdash;I think a 57 per cent reduction&mdash;it has come at an incredible cost: $430 million in redundancy payments. Those redundancy payments averaged out at $100,000 per wharfie&mdash;and that is in addition to their superannuation, long service leave, sick leave, et cetera.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I doubt there are many workplaces in Australia that have  seen such generous terms of redundancy offered to employees, particularly when half of the cost of those redundancies is being picked up by the taxpayer and the other half is being picked up by a government levy on all users of the waterfront. So ultimately all consumers in Australia, in one way or another, end up paying for the cost of that whole program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, this has been Labor's reform process, but it has been extremely generous, at a great cost to everybody else in this country and with some fairly dubious results, because many of the 57 per cent of people who were got rid of were not far off retirement any way. Indeed, the average age of waterside workers was well above 50 when all of this was going on. Not only were most of the fellows that took redundancies, particularly in the early stages, not far off retirement, but the people who remained have negotiated a deal for themselves that sees a wage increase of around 23 per cent. Everybody has come out a winner except the poor old taxpayer. At the same time, the sorts of productivity gains that we had hoped to achieve have started to slip away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the House last week I highlighted how in Sydney and in Melbourne the crane loading rates or TEUs per hour, whichever measure one wants to use, had dropped off in the last few months and had left Australia in a very uncompetitive position compared with other major trading ports around the world. In Sydney I think the TEUs per hour were about 14 and in Melbourne were about 18, whereas at the port of Auckland in New Zealand the rate was something like 31 TEUs per hour. So we have not got an internationally competitive waterfront as a result of the expenditure of all of this money and effort, but we have made those retiring wharfies extremely well funded for their retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put the fundamental question: why is it that the waterfront seems to be able to get such incredibly generous terms, paid for in the main by taxpayers, when virtually no other workplace in Australia can achieve the same? If 500 people were to be made redundant at, say, David Jones, the taxpayer would not be expected to foot the bill, nor would the terms of redundancy be as generous. It is very important for us to realise that, while this has been the government's reform, it has been very expensive and still has not made us internationally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I can refer to a comment that the minister made in question time some time ago, he claimed&mdash;I hope I am quoting him accurately&mdash;`And you blokes,' that is, the opposition, `have never done anything to fix things up on the waterfront.'

That is the case, and that is why this government injected the energy, time, money and the reform program that have achieved such dramatic results today&mdash;the reduction of the work force from the high 8,000s down to less than 4,000, and a dramatic increase in productivity of some 67 per cent in the process.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to hear the minister make those comments. I first talked about the urgent need for port authority reform some years ago. I remind the House that I have been in this portfolio area for five years this month. There have been seven ministers in that time. It has been quite an interesting passing parade of ministers. It is almost a death knell. You had better stick to industrial relations, Laurie.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During that time Senator Bob Collins was the minister responsible for transport. I said that we had an urgent need for port authority reform. Senator Collins said in the Senate during question time that I was obviously an idiot and an ignoramus, et cetera. He said, `Does he not understand that port authorities are the regime of the states; they have nothing to do with the Commonwealth? Making suggestions like this means he needs to go back to kindergarten, as far as parliament is concerned, to learn a little bit about what we do and what state governments do.' I am pleased to hear that he is doing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are substantial areas of reform in port authorities. Tomorrow in my office I will be seeing a port authority chief executive who has undertaken considerable reforms within his own port authority area. It is an area of extremely high cost in Australia. As the honourable member for La Trobe has pointed out, it helps contribute to the extremely high cost of getting goods across the Australian waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Port authority charges are not the only reason why we have high waterfront costs in Australia. The other side of the coin is that, generally speaking, our stevedoring charges are considerably higher. I can give examples, as I do at conferences around the country, of stevedoring charges in Australia being five times the cost of the same goods being handled over the waterfront in, say, Port Tauranga, in the north island of New Zealand. That is a clear disadvantage to Australian exporters and it is a clear disadvantage to Australian importers. Ultimately, it must impact on our potential to create jobs. Let us keep that in the back of our mind. Let us not try to put all the blame onto port authorities. Whilst they should rightly share some of the blame, there is still a long way for Australia to go before we will have completed the task of getting our waterfront into shape. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One lingering problem is the environment that operates on the waterfront. The minister says, `We decided to get in there and do something to fix up the waterfront; you guys obviously did nothing from 1975 to 1983.' That is an interesting point because the problem is that governments have always interfered with the waterfront. The waterside unions always knew that they could get away with a lot more than any other workplace in Australia by depending on governments to step in to try to take short-term, easy decisions to solve an industrial problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I would like to see the government decide to put the waterfront into the same category as any other workplace in Australia. That is, basically, not intervene every second week and not pay for everything that goes on, so the people on the waterfront know that they are like anybody else in this country. If we do that then we might start to see the whole philosophy of waterfront reform being fulfilled, remembering that, back in 1989 when this whole process commenced, the philosophy was to break down this industry-wide view that stevedoring was an industry and was not based on individual enterprises. We want to break down that view and make it an enterprise by enterprise activity. If we do that then the government has to get out of the action and let the industry, each enterprise, get on with its own affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As, I think, Bill Kelty said the other day, when there was a dispute with Australian Stevedores, particularly in Sydney, `Either we have an enterprise agreement or we don't. If we have an enterprise agreement then the minister should butt out and allow the enterprise agreement to work through its processes.' If that is the case then, whilst the industry might have disputes from time to time, ultimately it will be better off because the culture within the industry will be changed. That, ultimately, is the biggest advantage one can have. </PARA>

<PARA>Clause 20 proposes to insert a new section 26A in the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee Act which will require the committee to establish a register of stevedoring employees. Article 3 of ILO convention 137&mdash;the convention on dock work of 1973&mdash;requires the Australian government, having ratified the convention, to establish and maintain a register of dock workers.

For this purpose we will prescribe time and wages records under the Industrial Relations Act 1988&mdash;that is, the existing records that all employers must hold under the Industrial Relations Act. We will also consult the industry parties as to whether any other records should be so prescribed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee must establish a register containing the names of stevedoring employees.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us go back to what the minister uses for his justification for including these words in the bill&mdash;ILO convention 137, which was ratified by Australia on 24 June 1974. That particular ILO convention was all about the conversion of the industry from discrete cargo and bulk cargo handling to container handling. Throughout the industrialised world at the time, there was concern that this change to practice would mean that there would be massive redundancy across the waterfront industry and that the change to containers would mean that there would be fewer jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The convention then dealt with that issue in such a manner as to ensure that countries would sign it; that registered dock workers had a register; that the register was maintained; and that, unless they were paid out under redundancy schemes established by the industry, those people at that time had priority and had some power to seek recompense if they were being displaced by technology&mdash;which is in fact what happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cleared all of that out of the system over 20 years ago. For over two decades the whole world has been containerised. To say ipso facto that it is now an absolute requirement that Australia conform precisely to this now out-of-date ILO convention is a nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the minister that the convention was ratified by Australia in 1974. On any 10th anniversary after signing any ILO convention a country may denounce the convention in writing and that is the end of it. This is 1994&mdash;20 years from 1974. We simply denounce the convention, and that is the end of the issue. It is very simply done. We have dealt with the issue and we do not have to worry about going back to registers.

The only reason for a register is that the unions would like to reintroduce pooling. There can be no other reason. Let us make this absolutely clear to everyone who is either listening to this debate or who will read this debate at a subsequent time: the government's intention is solely to allow the unions the possibility of reintroducing pooled employment. Pooled employment and levies go hand in hand. That is why we are so opposed to this legislation. We do not support the minister's amendment. We do not support the clause.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the amendment. The minister has put forward the sole justification for the possibility of the reintroduction of the register as being the need to comply with ILO convention 137. There is an interesting psychology here because what is the ILO? Basically it is an international organisation of trade unions. Why should this country's sovereign government somehow or other be beholden to this organisation? The organisation does not have any powers over us; nor should it have any powers over us. Yet in this particular instance we are bringing this bill into the House simply on the basis that we have to do it because it meets with ILO convention 137.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleagues and I would take the view that meeting ILO convention 137 is immaterial; we do not need to do it. Indeed, in the process the minister goes against what he told the House not long ago when he said that it was not the intention of the government to reintroduce an employment register in the industry. The minister said that the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee would be making the decision. In answer to a question on 23 March he also said that any decision to reintroduce a register would not be made by him. Yet here we are in the House today talking about the need to reintroduce a register. It also goes against what his predecessor, Senator Collins, told the industry in correspondence on 2 September 1992. The then minister said that all industry based arrangements had to be rescinded by 31 October 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A register is an industry based arrangement, so it goes against what the Minister for Industrial Relations said some little time ago and it goes against what Senator Collins told the industry back in 1992. Therefore, it does cause us considerable concern. The other reason it causes us considerable concern, as I know it causes concern to many people on the waterfront, is that it reintroduces an industry wide arrangement to a sector of Australia's economy that has spent the last several years and a great deal of money trying to do away with industry based arrangements. That has been the whole thrust of waterfront reform; it has been designed to do away with those industry based arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we are introducing into the parliament through this legislation an arrangement where a register can be re-established. That is opposed by those people who employ waterfront labourers and it is opposed by those of us on this side of the House simply because it takes us right back to where we started from prior to 1989 when the waterfront was an industry based arrangement, where people viewed themselves as being part of some sort of giant collective rather than part of an individual enterprise. So, on the basis of that and on the basis of the investment that this nation has put into breaking up that industry based arrangement on the waterfront, we oppose it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe we oppose it on good and fair grounds. Simply to say we have to do it on the basis that ILO convention 137 requires it of us, I think is a nonsense. If we look at the 20 countries apart from Australia that have signed ILO convention 137&mdash;Afghanistan, Costa Rica, Cuba, Egypt, Finland, Greece, Guyana, Iraq, Italy, Kenya, The Netherlands, Nicaragua, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Tanzania and Uruguay&mdash;and compare them with the other major trading nations that have not signed it, then I think we have to ask ourselves why this is being moved. It is being moved simply to give more power to the Maritime Union of Australia so that it can reintroduce some of the good things it had to trade off in order to get that huge redundancy package and the 23 per cent pay rise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will first deal with the matter of denouncement raised by the honourable member for La Trobe. The fact is that, for Australia, any denouncement would take effect 10 years after the implementation of the treaty&mdash;which was in 1975, not 1974&mdash;so the proposed course of action the honourable member put to the House today would not be applicable this year; it would have to run 12 months down the track.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Forgetting that little technical problem in his scenario, it seems to me that it is impossible to get out of bed in the morning without hearing a conservative somewhere in Australia denounce our international obligations. Today in the House we have seen the honourable member for Hume describe the ILO as an `international organisation of trade unions'. They were his words. Let me remind him and the House that it is actually a tripartite organisation of employers, employees through their unions and governments. Indeed, in the first week of next month when I climb on board QF1 to go to the ILO convention, seated across the aisle opposite me will be none other than&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5T4">Mr BRERETON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly right. My colleague the honourable member for Hughes reminds me it will be none other than the shadow minister for industrial relations, who would not miss an opportunity&mdash;he certainly has not for several years&mdash;of going to the ILO international convention at its annual meets in Geneva in June. When we get there, who will be there to meet us at the airport to brief us from an employer's point of view? None other than Brian Noakes of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who represents Australian employers there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us understand clearly that this is not an international organisation of trade unions; it is a tripartite body to which this government, through our international treaty obligations, must ensure compliance with the treaties that we have adopted. One of those just happens to be ILO convention 137. Article 3 of that convention requires registers to be established and maintained for all occupational categories of dock workers in a manner to be determined by national law and practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have just introduced an amendment here in this place that would enable us to satisfy our obligations under article 3 of convention 137, without any additional impost on employers. We have said that the time and wages records that must be kept already under Australian law would constitute the register. I think that is an entirely reasonable way of Australia meeting its international treaty obligations, and at the same time ensuring that this paranoia about this being some Trojan horse on the way back to pooling is not the case. It is no Trojan horse, we are not moving to pooling and there is no secret plan involved. There is simply an intention by the government to give effect to our international treaty obligations. We will do so, and will do so properly and completely as a result of this measure. The opposition should not be opposing it but agreeing with it. There is no imposition on industry and the provision is in compliance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If opposition members want to go down this path of denouncing international treaty obligations, let me remind them that they cannot claim that they in government in their time did not ratify the odd treaty. There were not too many of them, but certainly conservative governments in this country have ratified ILO conventions that bring with them treaty obligations. Indeed, international covenants on civil and political rights were signed by the Fraser government and brought with them the same rights, obligations and responsibilities as we are pursuing in this measure that is now before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition should not be denouncing international treaty obligations because, as I have said, conservative governments have signed a few of their own. On the contrary, opposition members should be very proud of their governments' efforts, as we are of ours. They should be ashamed of the suggestion that is inherent in everything they say that the national government of Australia should flout international law by ignoring those self-same treaty obligations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot let that one go through to the keeper. It is demonstrably true that ILO convention 137 long ago outlived its usefulness. It is now a redundant document. I suggest to the minister that there are hundreds, if not thousands, of pages of redundant law on the books of the Commonwealth of Australia. I refer to statutes, regulations and rules which no longer are applied in fact but which exist in purely legal terms. Nobody would attempt to use outdated laws to take somebody to court because in justice there is no need, suddenly in 1994, for the government to reintroduce a register of employees to satisfy a redundant convention. This is a nonsense, and the minister knows it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's argument falls down. He stands and smiles and he knows that it has nothing to do with international obligations. Nobody will ever take us to task for not complying with ILO convention 137. The usefulness of the convention ceased 20 years ago, for heaven's sake. But suddenly are we to see brought into this place new bills, acts, rules and regulations to ensure that we comply with outdated legislation that still happens to be on the statute books? I think not because I think it is a nonsense. The minister should agree that there should be no more registers on the waterfront, there should be no more pooling, and he should agree to remove from the bill clause 20 and proposed section 26A. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I heard with interest the explanation of the minister about how we are really compelled to comply with ILO conventions because they are part of an international treaty system. He said that any responsible government would have to comply with them, otherwise it would be a bad citizen of the world. I have read out the list of countries that have signed it. One or two of the 20 that have signed it might be described as major shipping nations, but not many. What about all the other countries that have not that are major shipping nations of the world?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Kingdom does not comply with ILO convention 137. It does not see it in its interests to do so. The United States of America, Germany, Canada, Russia, the Ukraine, Japan, Singapore, Korea, Taiwan, South Africa, Nigeria, Brazil, the Argentine, Chile and so on do not feel compelled, as does this government, to kowtow to ILO convention 137. So I do not think there is any compulsion on Australia's behalf to kowtow to this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is beholden on this government to wisely spend Australia's money&mdash;taxpayers' money&mdash;and to do its very best to make Australia as competitive a nation on the world's trading markets as is possible so that we can create as many jobs as possible in Australia. If we are to go down this path of bowing to ILO convention 137, we create the possibility&mdash;the minister will deny it, as he already has&mdash;for the unions to re-establish a privileged position that waterside workers have enjoyed for a long time in Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am always fascinated when I go down on the waterfront and talk to these blokes. We have the history of the waterfront and the Australian shipping industry in our office upstairs. They all talk about the need to have strong unions and the need to have all these conditions because of things like the hungry mile and the way that all these people were taken advantage of. But the hungry mile was a long time ago. Waterside workers have enjoyed extraordinarily high privileges. But some of those privileges have been taken away over the last few years under the reform process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the MUA has got all that money&mdash;the $430 million&mdash;and the 23 per cent wage rise for its people and provided some nominal productivity increases, it is now trying to regain control of the waterfront by the establishment of a register. The government is complying with its wishes by saying that we have to have ILO convention 137 and a register in order to properly fulfil the requirements of that convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This simply does not hold water. It goes against everything that we have tried to achieve over the last few years. It is probably the single greatest cause of disappointment on the waterfront at present. If a register is re-established and it provides the opportunity for the MUA to regain some of that lost territory, mark my words: the MUA will regain it and Australians will be worse off because our waterfront will still not be competitive and we will not be able to maximise opportunities for Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the honourable member for Bennelong, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 22, page 5, omit "3" (twice occurring), substitute "4".</PARA>
<PARA>There is a very simple reason for this amendment. Of the four members of the finance committee, three are either union or government appointees directly and the fourth, if we take the minister's word for it, will be an industry representative who is largely supported by industry. It is a fact that the government can control the committee's decisions with the proposed three voting pattern and therefore the delegation of powers of the committee, because the committee's powers can be delegated completely in any respect in accordance with clause 22 by the vote of three of the four members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister appoints the ministerial appointment, controls the bureaucracy appointment and, in agreement with the ACTU, accounts for the third appointment. So, if the president or the secretary of the ACTU and the minister get together and agree on an agenda for the finance committee, the government certainly has the numbers. It is our contention that this issue works conjointly with our amendment No. 2, which was lost, but that the minister should, if he has any sense of fair play whatsoever, accept our recommendation that all four members of the committee be required to delegate the committee's powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister talked earlier of a report today in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. He said how wonderful it was that  Melbourne was no longer the most expensive port in the world. That is right: Melbourne is second, and Sydney is third. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Melbourne is so expensive that when the index was created in 1991 the port was allocated the base-line score of 100 per cent against which all other ports in the world were compared.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt it is expensive in both Melbourne and Sydney. There is no doubt that we have had some improvement in productivity on the waterfront, but we have so far to go that it is an absolute joke by international standards. We, Australia, when it comes to costs on the waterfront, are a real joke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister is introducing in this bill clauses which give us the opportunity of returning to the old bad practices of pooled employment on the waterfront controlled by the union and not relating employment to discrete individual employers. There will be no more competition&mdash;let us get rid of any competition so that we can take Melbourne back up and beat Hamburg. It is not fair, is it? Hamburg, for some strange reason, actually won; Melbourne is no longer the most expensive port in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the issue is simply that the minister has now used his numbers to pass clauses which will give us the opportunity for pooled employment. He now dictates the membership of the finance committee, which represents waterfront reform. And with clause 22, he allows any three of the four members to determine the agenda and delegate the committee's powers. The minister knows what is behind his legislation; I do not know. I know for sure that it is not sacrosanct ILO conventions, although I know the minister supports the ILO conventions and he has more than ably demonstrated his support for those conventions by ensconcing them in the Industrial Relations Act 1988 as part of his reform. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me make the position clear to the House. Under the present legislation the committee can only delegate to the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour. Whilst that might have been appropriate under industry arrangements prior to the reform program, the fact is that the industry has changed and, of course, so has the role of the association itself. It is appropriate that the committee be able to delegate more broadly if it sees fit. It is for the committee to decide. The bill simply enables this to happen. But it does so whilst maintaining the scope for delegation to the association, in accordance with the wishes of the authority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the committee structure, under the current act, the committee could delegate where at least six of its nine members agree, that is, a two-thirds majority. It always had a majority rule. In the existing provision it is two-thirds majority. Under this bill the delegation requires three of the four members of the committee to agree. So the actual threshold is higher; it is 75 per cent support rather than 66 2/3 per cent. Under the opposition's proposed amendment the committee could not delegate, unless all members agreed, that is, 100 per cent of the members. I think that really has the ability to make the committee itself unworkable. We have put forward in this legislation a practical step, consistent with the restructuring of the committee, and it has a significant safeguard in its application. </PARA>

The best is Rotterdam, and that just happens to be in the Netherlands, which just happens to be a signatory to ILO convention 137. The application of this convention has not stopped Rotterdam from being the best port in the world, and it certainly will not stop us from continuing to dramatically improve our performance. </PARA>

<PARA>The signing of the new financial agreement between the Commonwealth, states and territories by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the premiers, and chief ministers at the meeting of the Council of Australian Governments on 25 February 1994 was an important step in the continuing evolution of the Commonwealth's financial relationship with the states and territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill approves the new financial agreement, which provides for the continued existence of a loan council with broadly specified role and powers, sets out certain obligations in respect of past financial agreement borrowings and provides for formal membership of the Loan Council for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original financial agreement between the Commonwealth and the states was made in 1927 and approved under the Commonwealth's Financial Agreement Act 1928 and by the parliament of each state. The agreement established the Loan Council and required the Commonwealth and each state to submit an annual borrowing program for Loan Council approval. The agreement was last amended in 1976 and many of its provisions are now obsolete. In particular, Loan Council scrutiny of public sector borrowings has taken place for many years under voluntarily agreed arrangements rather than the provisions of the agreement. On this occasion, it is proposed that the existing agreement, as varied since 1927, be rescinded, as provided for under the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill, which is being introduced along with the National Debt Sinking Fund Repeal Bill 1994, establishes a new fund, the debt retirement reserve trust account, through which the redemption of Commonwealth government securities on issue on behalf of the states and the Northern Territory will be administered. This will replace arrangements through the national debt sinking fund for the states and through the Northern Territory debt sinking fund for the Northern Territory. The removal of the states from the ambit of the national debt sinking fund will facilitate the repeal of the National Debt Sinking Fund Act 1966 and the establishment of a more efficient debt redemption framework for the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new agreement would remove the requirement for future Commonwealth and state borrowings to be approved under the provisions of the agreement. This would reflect the reality that for many years only the Commonwealth's annual borrowing program has been formally approved under the financial agreement because only the Commonwealth undertakes budget sector borrowings directly rather than through a central borrowing authority outside the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1993-94, Commonwealth, state and territory borrowings have been subject to Loan Council monitoring under the new deficit based arrangements agreed by to by the Loan Council at its meetings in December 1992 and July 1993. These new arrangements, which superseded the global approach resolution, reflect the common interest of the Commonwealth and the states in ensuring that overall public sector borrowing in Australia is consistent with sound macro-economic policy and that borrowings by each government are consistent with a sustainable fiscal strategy. The emphasis in the new arrangements is on credible budgetary processes, ensuring a high level of community understanding of public sector financing and facilitating increased financial market scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new agreement would also remove the Commonwealth's explicit power to borrow on behalf of the states. Reflecting the states own borrowing activities outside the provisions of the agreement, the Commonwealth has undertaken no new money borrowings on behalf of the states since 1987-88. The Loan Council decided in 1990 that the states would progressively take over responsibility for debt previously issued on their behalf under the financial agreement. These arrangements place full responsibility on the states for financing and managing their own debt, thus subjecting their fiscal and debt management strategies to greater community and financial market scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the new agreement would abolish the restriction on states borrowing by the issue of securities in their own names in domestic and overseas markets. This would again recognise that the states conduct extensive borrowing activities through their central borrowing authorities outside the provisions of the agreement.

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND REPEAL BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this bill is to effect the repeal of the National Debt Sinking Fund Act 1966, thereby abolishing the national debt sinking fund and its controlling body, the National Debt Commission. This bill is being introduced along with a bill to amend the Financial Agreement Act to formalise changed borrowing and debt redemption arrangements agreed between the Commonwealth, the states and the territories following decisions at the June 1990 meeting of the Loan Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past, the Commonwealth has been inhibited from rationalising the debt redemption arrangements through the fund because of the necessary pre-condition for coordinated action by the Commonwealth and each of the states to amend the financial agreement. With the changes now proposed to the Financial Agreement Act, the opportunity is being taken to proceed with the repeal of the National Debt Sinking Fund Act 1966. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission was originally constituted by the National Debt Sinking Fund Act 1923, which also established the national debt sinking fund for the redemption of Commonwealth debt and placed the fund under the commission's control. The financial agreement of 1927 provided that sinking funds established in respect of the states' debts were placed under the control of the commission. The National Debt Sinking Fund Act 1966, which replaced the 1923 act, changed the sources of income to the fund and the assessment of contributions to the fund payable from the consolidated revenue fund of the Commonwealth. Variations to the financial agreement of 1976 provided for the absorption of the states' sinking funds into the national debt sinking fund, with separate accounts being maintained for the Commonwealth and each state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the terms of the current financial agreement, the states have been required to contribute to their sinking fund accounts at a rate sufficient to redeem only a very small portion of maturing debt each year, the debt being mostly rolled over into new raisings by the Commonwealth on the states' behalf. However, following the June 1990 meeting of the Loan Council, the states have made sufficient contributions into the fund to redeem in full their maturing debt each year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the financial agreement encompass amongst other things a formalisation of that basis of contribution and establish a new trust fund, the debt retirement reserve trust account, to handle the redemption of Commonwealth government securities on issue to the states and the Northern Territory. The separate Northern Territory debt sinking fund, established under the Audit Act 1901, through which debt redemption has proceeded on an identical basis to that for the states, would cease to operate from the date of establishment of the debt retirement reserve trust account. The final series of Commonwealth government securities on issue for the states and the territories will mature in 2005-06, bringing to an end the debt redemption arrangements through the debt retirement reserve trust account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the removal of the states from the ambit of the national debt sinking fund, the fund is rendered a purely Commonwealth fund, the separate existence of which is no longer necessary. For the Commonwealth, the fund was designed originally to provide investors with confidence that their investment was secure with the government paying money into a fund to meet the eventual redemption, or in the case of certain issues floated overseas, to redeem the debt progressively over a specified time span. The Commonwealth's reputation in capital markets has, of course, subsequently become well established, rendering the fund redundant also in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, in practice, the transactions of the fund on behalf of the Commonwealth are integrated into the Commonwealth's overall debt management activities and the allocation of particular debt redemption transactions to the fund is essentially an accounting matter. Against this background, the role of the commission has become vestigial. The sole activity of this body, chaired by the Treasurer, with, as other commissioners, the Secretary to the Treasury, the Governor of the Reserve Bank, the Secretary to the Attorney-General's Department and a representative of the states, is to meet briefly once each year to formally authorise the program of transactions of the fund for the current financial year and to approve its annual report for the past financial year. Secretariat services are provided to the commission by the Commonwealth Treasury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The continued existence of the fund would perpetuate an unduly complicated accounting and administrative structure for only a portion of the Commonwealth's debt redemption activities. In years of significant budget surplus, such as in the late 1980s, the annual redemption of the Commonwealth's debt is greater through other accounts within the Commonwealth public account, such as the loan consolidation and investment reserve, than through the fund. In years of budget deficit, redemptions of the Commonwealth's debt through the fund are met under an appropriation from the consolidated revenue fund, but in effect they are financed by borrowing and the debt is therefore rolled over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, while debt redemption processes through the national debt sinking fund have been by way of reimbursement by the fund of payments made on its behalf to holders of debt, the fund has also been required to maintain balances as if it was paying debt holders directly. This has been of significance given the standing of the fund as separate from other elements of the trust fund within the Commonwealth public account. As a consequence, there has been the potential for higher debt issuance and public debt interest costs than those which would have been necessary with non-separation of the national debt sinking fund. An offset to this increase has been provided by resultant higher interest earnings on the Commonwealth's cash balances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the repeal of the National Debt Sinking Fund Act 1966, a more streamlined debt redemption framework would be established. Redemptions on behalf of the Commonwealth would be met through the consolidated revenue fund, the loan fund and the loan consolidation and investment reserve under existing standing appropriation provisions and legislative authorities. These funds are already used for redemptions which are unable to be funded through the resources of the sinking fund. Under these arrangements, a comprehensive reporting of the financial year's debt redemption activity would continue in order to maintain public accountability. I commend this bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Financial Agreement Bill and the National Debt Sinking Fund Repeal Bill were brought into the House on 23 March 1994. The Financial Agreement Bill 1994 approved a new financial agreement between the Commonwealth, the states and the territories. It further amends the 1927 financial agreement, which was approved under the Financial Agreement Bill 1928. The main purpose of this bill is to include the two mainland territory governments in the loan council process and to clarify and amend the powers of the council, the states and the Commonwealth under the agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For convenience, references in these remarks to the states or a state should be taken to include the Northern Territory or Australian Capital Territory unless the context renders that understanding inappropriate. The obligations of past borrowings under the Loan Council are also covered in the bill. The new agreement is a result of the Loan Council's decision to amend the 1927 financial agreement, although this is not the first change to that agreement. Under section 105A(4) of the constitution, the parties to the agreement are empowered to vary or rescind it. In fact, the agreement has been varied on seven occasions, most recently in 1976.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, the new agreement provides for the following changes: it abolishes the restriction on the states borrowing in their own names; it removes the Commonwealth's explicit power to borrow on behalf of the states; it removes the requirement for future Commonwealth and state borrowings to be approved under the provisions of the agreement; it removes references to the national debt sinking fund; and it includes the Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory as members of the Loan Council and as partners to the financial agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also provides for the establishment of debt redemption arrangements, through the debt retirement reserve trust account, to replace those which have operated through the national debt sinking fund and the Northern Territory debt sinking fund. This formalises arrangements made by the Commonwealth, the states and the territories which have applied since 1 July 1990 and were first agreed to at the June 1990 meeting of the Loan Council. The establishment of the debt retirement reserve trust account has given cause for the repeal of the National Debt Sinking Fund Act 1966 and for the redundancy of the National Debt Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as the original financial agreement was ratified by the Commonwealth and all the states, so too will the new agreement. This new agreement will be given effect only by the passage of complementary legislation via the Commonwealth, states and territories, and will not become effective until it has been enacted in all jurisdictions. The Financial Agreement Bill makes no attempt to rectify the appalling fiscal imbalance between the Commonwealth and the states, nor does it pretend to. This bill, in fact, only reflects the reality of the changed financial situation by which the states have been able to avoid the Loan Council's global borrowing limits. This has been achieved by the use of central borrowing authorities, which have borrowed for state government instrumentalities and now borrow for the whole of the states public sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last few years, the Loan Council's monitoring of public sector borrowings has also taken place under informal rules rather than the provisions of the financial agreement, and the Commonwealth has not undertaken borrowings on behalf of the states since 1987-88. These factors have given added impetus to the Commonwealth and state governments to develop an agreement that better reflects the realities of state borrowing practices. Let us hope that if states borrow in their own names they will be subject to outside market scrutiny, because they will be required to provide detailed information regarding their net debt position to the Loan Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the new system, the Loan Council will replace global limits with a scheme based on a state's overall net borrowing position. This will be called a Loan Council allocation&mdash;or LCA&mdash;which will not only reflect a state's net debt level but will factor in the macro-economic outlook and the fiscal outlook of each state or territory. More important factors that would be examined are capital needs, infrastructure requirements and comparative fiscal circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Loan Council can request a state or territory to modify its fiscal strategy or its borrowing request. In the new environment, the Loan Council also intends to examine the financing devices used by the states in the 1980s that circumvented global borrowing limits. This includes matters such as operating leases, finance leases and private sector involvement in public sector infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In this new environment, the Loan Council's role will be that of a coordinating agency. The Financial Agreement Bill retains the Loan Council but limits its powers to making recommendations. The coalition does not oppose these bills, but we have serious concerns about the vertical fiscal imbalance that exists between the Commonwealth and the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> At the time of drafting the constitution, the states agreed to a division of powers between the Commonwealth and the states. Some powers were to be the exclusive preserve of the Commonwealth and some were to be concurrent. The residual powers were to be the preserve of the states. The so-called federal compact to which the states originally agreed was a very different arrangement to that which now prevails. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Change over almost 100 years is certainly inevitable, but the continuing march of the Commonwealth to increase its powers at the expense of the states has been relentless. At various stages in our history as a federation, the pursuit of increased powers by the Commonwealth has been a deliberate policy objective. The Commonwealth's grab for a uniform income tax system during the Second World War, using the wartime powers of the constitution, was a sensible decision in a time of war, but it undoubtedly laid the foundations of the current vertical fiscal imbalance of which we speak. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The coalition strongly supports the federal system in which federal and state powers are distributed to encourage participation and to act as an effective barrier against centralist, remote and even authoritarian control. The problem arises when state governments do not have the means to tax on their own behalf and meet their own expenditures. This is the problem the states are currently experiencing. The states are reliant on tied Commonwealth grants for a large part of their revenues, which are continually being reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A position paper of the premiers and chief ministers published in May 1992 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth-state financial arrangements</EMPHASIS> states, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A crisis in state finances has resulted from:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(from 1982-83 to 1991-92 the real reduction in general revenue funds&mdash;excluding identified health grants&mdash;and general purpose capital payments has been $3.4 billion); and</PARA>

<PARA>The premiers and chief ministers say in parenthesis:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(Specific payments have increased from 30.4 per cent of total Commonwealth payments to the states in 1982-83 to 41.1 per cent in 1991-92).</PARA>
<PARA>The paper goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The negative impact of the reduction in Commonwealth payments to the states cannot be overemphasised. Since 1982-83, Commonwealth own purpose outlays have increased by 35.5 per cent in real terms, compared with a reduction of 1.7 per cent for the Commonwealth payments to the states. Until 1989-90, the effect of this financial squeeze on state budgets was cushioned by revenue growth resulting from the one-off speculative boom in asset prices. Only since this speculative bubble has burst has the underlying financial position of the states been exposed.</PARA>
<PARA>The increase in federal own purpose outlays reveals the budget surpluses of the mid-1980s for what they actually were. They were not the result of the government's cutting back on its own spending; they were, instead, due to the fiscally lax administration that passed all cuts in Commonwealth expenditure onto the states via reduced grants. The states paid for the budget surpluses of the 1980s of which Labor is so proud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is easier for the Commonwealth to cut grants to the states than to reduce the amounts of its own outlays. Of course it is. This achieves the goal of cutting net government outlays&mdash;that is, the spending of all governments&mdash;onto the states. The states thereby have to cut their spending to meet the falling level of federal grants, or raise their taxes, or raise their borrowings. The states have a more limited opportunity of raising taxes, suffering as they do from a narrow tax base which is gradually diminishing and is extremely regressive. To highlight the impact of the Commonwealth's slashing of grants to the states, I will quote Claude Forell who, on 26 February 1992, wrote in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And if the Keating government had been willing to allocate grants to the states on the same formula as the Fraser government used in the early 1980s, Victoria would have been $2 billion the richer and finished the year with a budget surplus.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Keating government has been deliberately slashing state funding for more than strictly economic reasons. In the name of national priorities and with the arrogant assumption that Canberra knows best, it has been trying to reduce the states to little more than agents or contractors of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA>It is obvious that Labor is furthering its centralist agenda by depriving the states of the means to pursue new programs or even, in many cases, to maintain current levels of service delivery. Yes, the states do have room to improve efficiency in their programs, but the Commonwealth has a lot more bureaucratic fat that is now very much in need of urgent trimming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position of the Australian states compared with that of states in other federations is of serious concern to the coalition. The Special Premiers Conference in October 1990 initiated a review of the financial arrangements between the levels of government in the Australian federation to determine whether existing arrangements could be changed to enable governments to govern better. The report of that review, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Taxation and the fiscal imbalance between levels of the Australian government</EMPHASIS>, was released in October 1991. According to that report, Germany and Canada have both achieved near vertical fiscal balance. In Australia, the states raised only 40 per cent of their outlays by taxation, whereas in Canada and in Germany the figure is 90 per cent and in the United States 130 per cent. Conversely, in Australia the federal government raises 130 per cent of its outlays, whereas in Canada and Germany the figure is 100 per cent and in the United States 90 per cent. In Germany, the Laender&mdash;the name for the equivalent of our states&mdash;are entitled to a constitutionally guaranteed share of income tax, and have made an agreement with the federal government for a set share of consumption tax revenues. No doubt some will be wondering why the coalition continues to argue for a move to a more balanced fiscal situation for the states. The fact is that better administration occurs where governments raise the money that they spend. Kenneth Davidson wrote in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on 26 March 1994:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The complexity of the federal system, which obscures which level of government is really responsible for various services, confuses the electorate and promotes irresponsible government.</PARA>
<PARA>An editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 24 February 1994, which discusses state taxation powers, reads, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But there is also a powerful logic in the argument that, if we want the states to be more responsible and accountable, they should not be so constrained by a big brother approach.</PARA>
<PARA>John Stone, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> of 8 August 1992, commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth is raising more than 50 per cent above its needs. That is then transferred to the states, often with strings attached. This detachment of spending from revenue has caused a failure by both federal and state bureaucracies to behave responsibly. If raising money and spending it were done by the same government, the government would be more responsible.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be aware that other analysts have made like minded comments. Clearly, there is a need for the states to have secure access to reliable sources of revenue which they can outlay as they deem fit and proper. This could occur through either some form of tax sharing, as in Germany, the states increasing existing taxes or, possibly, the Commonwealth giving the states access to excise and sales taxes. Whatever the result, it is not desirable for the states to try to bridge the gap between current receipts and outlays by only increasing existing taxes, however. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current tax bases of the states are too narrow and inelastic, and will not grow as rapidly as the economy grows. State taxes are also highly concentrated on business inputs, which distort business decision making and business competitiveness. Such taxes include taxes on payroll, petroleum products, financial transactions, land sales and the registration of motor vehicles. Overall, state taxes are regressive. The question remains: why has nothing been done to rectify what is patently a problem?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991 the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and the then Premier of New South Wales, Mr Greiner, began a process of reform of Commonwealth-state relations that became known as new federalism. The objectives of that short lived attempt at new federalism were the speeding up of micro-economic reform and the provision of a secure share of federal tax collections for the states. Some progress has been made in micro-economic reform, such as the creation of the National Rail Corporation, the interstate electricity grid and the national heavy vehicle registration system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, though, the process has been derailed by Prime Minister Keating's bloody-minded campaign to scuttle the Hawke prime ministership. Prime Minister Keating, the supposed great reformer, allowed himself to be seen then for what he really is: the great destroyer. The national interest is not a concern of the present Prime Minister. His only interest seems to lie in increasing his degree of power and the power and influence of his mates. His pursuit of more and more centralist control using dubious means, such as the external affairs power, has only helped to further fragment our federation. The Prime Minister's pursuit of a republic has at its core, I believe, a desire for centralist uniformity of policy and institutions and the eventual outcome of abolishing the states. The Prime Minister is a wrecker. He is beset by a miserable frenzy of destruction, using as his tools the mockery of tradition, the states, the monarchy, the Senate, the process of parliamentary democracy and accountability to the Australian people and this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Labor had any respect for the federal compact and a desire for true reform, both macro- and micro-economic, it would address the key problems currently hindering the federation. These include the poor state of Commonwealth-state financial arrangements, the Commonwealth-state bureaucratic duplication, and the grab for extra powers at the expense of the states by means of the external affairs powers and other constitutional powers, with or without the acquiescence of the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An improved fiscal relationship between the Commonwealth and the states is a key to facilitating micro-economic reform. The states are now highly committed to micro-economic reform in areas such as road and rail transport, as well as electricity generation, transmission and distribution. To the extent that the states are unable to lead the way, the cause is a lack of financial manoeuvrability to meet short-term costs of reform and the fear of losing revenue with no replacement source being available. It is all good and well for the Commonwealth to lecture the states on the need for reform, but until the federal government addresses the concerns of the states all reform will be much slower than required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Duplication between the Commonwealth and the states is an increasing problem that must be eliminated if the Commonwealth really wants to cut back on its recurrent outlays and provide the states with a more secure revenue base. The Commonwealth's</PARA>
<PARA>indulging, through DEET, in the development of policies for primary and secondary school schooling is a blatant attempt at political interference in the prime responsibilities of the states, just as many of the endeavours of the federal health ministry are. The Commonwealth has no schools and hospitals and should butt out. It is as simple as that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the states want a national approach on various issues, they are more than capable of establishing their own joint committees independent of the federal government. Labor needs to get the message that the Commonwealth does not need to have its finger in every pie. Duplication is wasteful and both the Commonwealth and the states need to examine where functions can best be performed. The coalition believes that many activities can be best handled at the state level while there are some that need a national approach, possibly under the Commonwealth banner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Australia moves relentlessly under Labor to increasingly centralised government, the international trend is in the opposite direction. Belgium recently adopted a federal system, as have many of the former eastern bloc countries. Even the United Kingdom is toying with decentralisation under urging from Scotland and, to a lesser extent, from Wales. Just as business and the Australian Public Service are devolving powers and responsibilities to local areas and smaller business units, the federal government continues to buck the trend to pursue its policy of all power to the centre. What is needed is a commitment from the Commonwealth to give the states a source of revenue that redresses the current vertical fiscal imbalance and allows the states to compete with each other to provide taxpayers with choice and a better quality of state government. That is competitive federalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increasing dominance of the Commonwealth over the revenue raising and expenditure decisions of the states has negated the possible benefits of a federal system of government to a large degree. The revenue dominance of the Commonwealth also leads to large grants which can themselves be a source of inefficiency, poor accountability and weakened responsiveness in public decision making. By contrast, competition between the states provides a number of testing grounds for policy options. Clearly, no government is blessed with complete wisdom in all policy areas. Experimentation and diversity in policy programs will demonstrate the advantages of various approaches. Successful programs will be copied by other governments, just as poor initiatives will not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present system stifles diversity and responsiveness to regional and local needs and preferences, especially where tied grants are used to impose uniform standards. While there may be some need for uniformity, there can also be a serious side where uniformity is pursued unnecessarily. To maximise competitive pressure, each government has to be, as near as possible, responsible and accountable for its own revenue raising and expenditure decisions. This would allow each state to provide a tax and service package which has to compete with packages from other states. Such an approach would promote greater choice and a more efficient public sector. There is much to be said for competitive federalism; for competition in policy and service delivery between the states and also between local governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In concluding, I would like to quote from a column written by Professor Cliff Walsh and published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 6 July 1993. Professor Walsh stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The single most consistent conclusion has been that acting alone, the states can only patch up and extend an inherently inefficient, distorting and regressive structure of taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If an efficient and robust system of state taxation is what is desired&mdash;and it should be if national efficiency and competitiveness, as well as making good the national revenue shortfall, are the prime objectives&mdash;then only a national review and national action will secure the required changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This might need a new financial agreement between the Commonwealth and the states: it certainly will require a change of attitude and greater cooperation between all of them.</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition hopes that Labor will heed this advice. The clock cannot be turned back to 1991 but, if this government is really concerned about the good governance of the nation and a need for comprehensive reform, it will renew discussions with the states on some form of revenue sharing along the lines discussed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government needs to match its rhetoric on micro-economic reform with action. Labor's obsession with, and pursuit of, increased centralism needs to be consigned to the dustbin of history if micro-economic reform and the reform of our system of government are to be successful.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to say a number of things about this bill, but one minute to three is not the time to start on them. I would like to make one point about the bill itself. I welcome the fact that it includes the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory in the Loan Council. They are both self-governing territories now. It is logical that they should be recognised legally as part of the Loan Council. This bill makes that change, together with a number of other changes to borrowing arrangements, which are very desirable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those changes include abolishing a restriction on the states borrowing in their own name, a very sensible and reasonable proposal; removing the Commonwealth's explicit power to borrow on behalf of the states; removing the need for future borrowing by the Commonwealth or the states to be approved under the agreements; and this admission of both territories to the Loan Council. So this bill does update the borrowing arrangements for the Commonwealth and the states. It should be supported on both sides of the House. I will resume my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think honourable members will be aware of a growing community concern about this issue&mdash;a concern which I am pleased to say is generally shared by members of the opposition across this country. Some 2,600 women die every year of this disease. I want to draw the attention of honourable members to a committee of this parliament which was established before I was elected&mdash;the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs. It has a subcommittee which is looking at the question of management and treatment of breast cancer. A lot of the enthusiasm&mdash;I would say that some of it is politically driven&mdash;for this whole push in the breast cancer area, which I welcome, has overlooked the fact that management and treatment of breast cancer is at least as important as research.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What that committee has been hearing around the country is that in the treatment of breast cancer there is very little follow-up of women, some of the procedures that are used are out of date, and best practice is not necessarily on the minds of those people who are part of the profession dealing with this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that honourable members will appreciate that it is not just a question of additional research&mdash;certainly not the ten-fold one-off increase that has been promoted by the Leader of the Opposition; it is a question of a comprehensive program of screening, of treatment, of research and of evaluation of what is being done. I believe honourable members will see in the budget, as it is announced tonight, that we are addressing all of those issues. In my view, we already have the best breast screening program in the world. It is comprehensive and it deserves our support.</PARA>

I would like to say to the Minister for Health in New South Wales that that falls far short of what is required under matching funding. It is more like $14 million. While I commend him for announcing it in advance, I say to him, if he is serious, will he please explain why New South Wales is 60,000 behind in the mammography screening program and $3 million underspent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, it is going to create the environment in which we can get the sustained economic growth which will produce the jobs. We have said that the economic growth that we are now experiencing, if sustained, will produce the targets that are outlined in the white paper. If you have any doubt about that, look at what was achieved between 1983 and 1989&mdash;1.6 million jobs, with economic growth consistently in the order of four to 4 1/2 per cent. Our capacity to sustain is not in doubt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I would suggest to the honourable member is that he look not only at that track record in terms of what we have promised but also at the promise we made in 1983, when we first came to government. We said `500,000 jobs in three years' and we delivered more than that in two. In coming to power in this last election, we said that we would create 500,000 jobs in the next term. We have already created 230,000 jobs since April and 120,000 in the last six months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The job growth that we have created is where the job opportunity is coming from that people such as your constituent can take advantage of, but the problem for Sean Adams in your electorate is that he has been out of the work force for a long time. Economic growth cannot be guaranteed to get that person a job.

You do not understand the basis upon which the training wage has been introduced.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Given that reason alone, I would thought that one or two members of the opposition would also be keen on the rapid introduction of digital rather than analog. The second reason is that digital phones can be used in other countries. If the honourable member for Bennelong happens to be travelling to Geneva for an ILO convention, he can use his digital service. The digital service also has advanced features which the analog service does not have and, most importantly&mdash;as the right honourable member for New England, as a former communications minister, would know&mdash;the digital service also makes much more efficient use of the electromagnetic spectrum. For that reason, we are very keen to see the introduction of digital. Just as CDs replaced LP records, it is inevitable that digital mobile telephones will replace analog mobile telephones, despite the fact that the Leader of the National Party wants to drag his feet and stop the introduction of this new technology. We in the government will be moving ahead while the opposition is trying to hold us back.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By announcing its decision in February 1992 that the phase-out would be in the year 2000, the government did give consumers and the industry eight years advance notice that this was going to take place. But, ultimately, the success of the introduction of the digital telephone service will depend on the carriers. At the moment, under the analog system, Telecom is the only carrier that provides the infrastructure. At least with the digital service, Telecom, Optus and Vodaphone will each be putting in its own services so we have a much more competitive regime. More competition means lower prices for consumers&mdash;domestic and business&mdash;and also more pressure to provide better services for consumers. That is another reason we should be encouraging digital rather than the monopoly analog service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, while the digital service is available at the moment only in the major capital cities&mdash;in the CBDs&mdash;each of the carriers has said that it expects to have coverage for 80 per cent of the Australian population by 1995. But it is up to them: the sooner they invest the funds to install the infrastructure, the sooner people can migrate from analog to digital; and that is, of course, in the long-term interests of the carriers. My concern has been that each of the carriers should make it clear to consumers who are still purchasing analog phones what is going to happen.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to get the quote right because I am going to quote some of the honourable member's state colleagues. The Tasmanian premier, Mr Groom, is reported in last Thursday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> as describing the initiatives outlined in Working Nation as welcome and encouraging. In this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, the South Australian minister for employment and training, Dr Bob Such, saw much to like in the program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably, not all state ministers are prepared to consider the white paper on its manifest merits. In fact, some have expressed concerns which can really only be the result of misunderstandings. For example, in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, the Victorian minister for tertiary education and training, Mr Haddon Storey, is reported as having a range of concerns. I should really take this opportunity to assure him and his colleagues opposite that his fears are groundless.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> For a start, Mr Storey is reported as saying that the white paper could well create a separate federal vocational education and training system running parallel to, and presumably in competition with, those of the states. Let me put his mind at rest. The Commonwealth has no, absolutely no, intention of duplicating the states' training institutions. Far from it. The role of the state TAFE systems as providers of a huge number of the nation's training places is absolutely fundamental to the philosophy of Working Nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the national employment and training task force, or NETTFORCE, which was announced in the white paper, is there precisely to ensure that the new training initiatives are commensurate with the capabilities and capacities of the various state systems. Certainly NETTFORCE is there to promote mechanisms to recognise training so that the whole agenda does not become strangled by bureaucracy. This accreditation will only stand until the accreditation by state authorities is provided. In short, NETTFORCE in this exercise is the states' partner, not their master.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There is also no doubt that the Commonwealth recognises and will encourage the pivotal role of the private sector in providing training. Frankly, I defy any state minister to explain why this is not a good and necessary thing. There is also no commonsense reason why employers should not play a role in ensuring that they get the trained workers they require.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Storey is also reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review </EMPHASIS>as saying that the white paper places the role of the Australian National Training Authority in doubt. That is another furphy. ANTA is the nation's peak training body. It reports not to the Commonwealth but to all training ministers, Commonwealth and state. We could not change ANTA's coordinating role even if we wanted to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, we have to wonder whether these concerns are based less on misunderstandings of such obvious and incontestable principles as much as on a desire of Victorian officials to protect their own little empires. I appeal to Victorian ministers and others to recognise that the training needs of Australians are the same wherever they are in the country; they do not miraculously change when one crosses the Nullarbor or the Murray river.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short term, the army is considering a number of proposals to address the problem through transfers, retaining some category 2 positions upon which there is an expected limit of recruiting achievement, having experienced direct entry personnel fill some of the positions and so forth. However, we expect that in the longer term the problem will reduce as the ready reserve officers and non-commissioned officers assume the tasks that are proposed to be undertaken by the regular personnel in the irregular format in which the ready reserve was originally proposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The article the honourable member referred to in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> also alleged that the cost of the ready reserve had risen to some 75 per cent of that of regular soldiers. I am advised that that is nonsense.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the right honourable member for New England that export licences belong to the Commonwealth, not to the state of Tasmania.

I say that that comes as some surprise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The press reports that he has contacted the Commonwealth. To date he has not contacted my office. I would be quite surprised if he were seeking such an increase. The reality is that last year the exports of woodchips were approximately 2.65 million tonnes and there would have to be a substantial increase in demand for it to be approaching the four million tonnes that the Premier of Tasmania supposedly requests. In fact, the current quota is 3.67 million tonnes, taking into account the increase from the Helsham agreement of a further 800,000 tonnes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Premier of Tasmania does wish to raise the issue with me, there are certain processes that have to be undertaken under the MOU between the Commonwealth and Tasmania, and I would be happy to receive those representations. But, in fact, we must take account of three things: first, the export price for the woodchips must be an adequate return for the resource; second, the very important environmental considerations have to be taken into account; and, third, the important issue that is always raised by Tasmanian members to me&mdash;value adding&mdash;that we are getting the best price for our resource rather than just woodchips.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have noticed recent comments by some sectors of the industry that they think the smart way to go is to actually not value add, not to make veneers, not to make timber products, but just to export woodchips. I would caution them over this approach as it is obviously in Australia's interest to value add. As we all know in the licence agreements that are there, the licence agreements themselves that the companies accept, the first call has to be on Australian manufacturers for the woodchip resource.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that there are three areas in which this individual could well be better off. In relation to the changes that have been made to the income support measures&mdash;I am not too sure whether the honourable member said this person was married with two children&mdash;the opportunity for the spouse to gain access to the parenting allowance may well present itself as such that the attraction for going onto the dole is no longer as attractive as it was.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second area where I think there will be significant opportunity in this is that the day a week that this person has been cut down by could now well be combined with a training package under the new training wage arrangements that we have negotiated with the ACTU. Essentially, what we are saying is that the employer will be given far more scope now to identify and seek approval for training on the job that particularly relates to the attributes of the business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Previously, the structured training regime was such that, to get into a traineeship&mdash;and therefore to get accredited training&mdash;a person essentially had to be away from the place for two days of the week. That was not always attractive to employers, particularly when they were in small businesses. So we have freed that up. It is for that reason that the employers around the country, in particular those that represent small businesses, are applauding the initiatives that the government has taken in relation to the training wage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might also say in relation to this person that if, in the context of the new revamped CES, he or she wanted to get assistance in a much more flexible application of the existing labour market programs, there could well be many more beneficial options open to that person than just going on the dole. We have significantly reduced the incentive for dole versus work because we have widened the opportunities and we have changed the income support measures.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. Yes, I did receive an appeal last week from the New South Wales Premier for help to meet an urgent request from Care International. The regional coordinator of that organisation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, David Pigot, asked whether New South Wales could supply registration and number plates for 19 vehicles in one of its humanitarian truck fleets carrying stores in Bosnia. Mr Pigot said that Care had been trying for several weeks to obtain temporary registration in Croatia and to avoid paying the prohibitive registration duty on the grounds that Care is a registered relief agency in that country. However, this was proving very difficult and, in the meantime, the truck fleet and its Australian drivers were idle. New South Wales was unable to assist because, under the 1968 international agreement, New South Wales registrations are not recognised internationally. So the request came to me because the Commonwealth government is so recognised. I immediately asked my department to do all it could to help Care solve the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>

The plates can be used in the truck fleet on the basis that they will be returned to Dasfleet when the vehicles finish service in Croatia and Bosnia.

Under the case management approach, which we have resourced the capacity to undertake, the people entering the job compact will essentially get to a stage where they are job ready.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="557" SPEAKER="Free The Hon R.V." NAMEID="HG4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="LINDSAY" MINISTERIAL="SCHOOLS, VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HG4">Mr FREE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Moreton for his question. The experience of the last 10 years has shown us that without some form of post-school training the chances for young people starting on a fulfilling and rewarding career are grim at best. For example, the profile of the early school leaver which was contained in the recent Australian youth survey illustrated this fact. It showed that young people leaving school early and not completing further education or training are less likely to have a job; in fact, they are eight to 10 times more likely to join the pool of long-term unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To ensure that all young people have access to quality skills development that their future depends on, the government in the white paper increased its already enormous commitment to entry level training. The initiatives announced last week are not cheap, but every dollar spent on job generating entry level training is a dollar which the government must spend. The choice we face is quite clear: we can either extend our commitment to training or watch a generation of school leavers face a future of very limited employment opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why the Commonwealth is providing an additional $770 million over four years from 1994-95 to create an additional 50,000 entry level training places. I stress that this is new expenditure for new places entirely additional to the Commonwealth's existing commitment to expanding the nation's TAFE systems. We ought to recognise that expansion of the TAFE systems is an enormous investment in the nation's future in its own right. Over four years commencing 1993, the Commonwealth is providing an additional $1.1 billion to expand the nation's TAFE systems. To ensure that young people joining the work force have access to that mix of skills at the school level that employers are going to need&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having established that the opposition is not interested in the expansion of training opportunities for young people and having established that the opposition has no interest in the expansion of work experience for youngsters at school, I conclude my response to the honourable member for Moreton by pointing out to him that another important initiative in the white paper makes structured training available to young people before they leave school. This is in the form of an allocation by the government of some $38 million over the next four years to the new Australian Student Traineeship Foundation. This will be providing accredited off-the-job industry training for some 5,000 senior secondary school students. We expect that the work of the foundation will catalyse a new culture which will end the artificial divide between the world of school and the world of work.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been wondering who might ask me a question on this matter. We have had about three frontbench spokesmen of the Liberal Party trying to up the ante on each other during the last 24 hours as to who actually is the spokesperson on this matter. We have had the honourable member for Bradfield, the finance spokesman and the honourable member for Mackellar.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was going to suggest to the frontbench&mdash;because I expected this question from the honourable member for Mackellar&mdash;that on this matter, as on others, the rest of the members of the frontbench, sardined like they are at the moment, might be able to exit the place and just leave absolutely everything up to her. She now seems to be the commentator on everything.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note these things about the question that was put to me. Firstly, I understand that in evidence before a parliamentary committee the Auditor-General was pleased to say that he believed that the deal that was signed up was a good deal. That was a statement from the Auditor-General. Secondly, I draw attention to the fact that there is no government policy or government direction which obliged the conclusion of those arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third thing I note on this, because I noticed honourable members opposite were saying they did not know the terms of reference, is that they approved them two months ago. The terms of reference that they approved two months ago for the inquiry which has now effectively had to be aborted were the terms of reference that were passed across them and agreed to. Those are the terms of reference that Judge Morling will operate under. So I am glad to have the opportunity to clear up that element of confusion amongst them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also some confusion, in the propositions that have been put forward, as to the financial arrangements of the Auditor-General. I say these things: firstly, government support for the Auditor-General financially has been increasing well above the rate of inflation in each of the last three years. Secondly, the Auditor-General actually has control over a very substantial proportion of his own budget, because those parts of his activity that go to financial statements on departments are activities that he can charge out on a cost recovery basis. So, whatever particular cost structure he has in place, he is able to ensure that those costs are recovered in the processes that he goes through in that financial statement area. If he chooses to charge less than the going rate, that is a matter for him. If he chooses to charge more, that is also a matter for him.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today's inauguration of Nelson Mandela as the President of the Republic of South Africa marks nothing less than the birth of a new nation&mdash;a nation where the scourge of apartheid has been once and for all abolished; a nation where every citizen, whatever his or her race, has equal worth and an equal right to shape the country's future; a South Africa free at last.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today is deservedly a day of triumph for Nelson Mandela himself. His election as President, the swearing in of the wholly non-racial parliament in which the ANC is the clear majority party, and the installation of a government of national unity reflecting not only the ANC but all major streams of opinion in the parliament are triumphant realisations of the vision and the ideas he has held and the principles for which he has fought for so long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nelson Mandela showed in his trial 30 years ago, throughout his 27-year incarceration, and in the four years since his release, true leadership: a noble vision of justice and equality for all; single-minded determination and total commitment; toughness in negotiations, combined with constant readiness to hold out the hand of friendship; and great personal courage&mdash;all combined with an extraordinary personal dignity and an almost awesome absence of personal bitterness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today is also a day to honour those other South Africans who have fought so long and hard for so many years for this change&mdash;those who in many cases, in long and lonely years in gaol or in other ways, suffered as grievously as Nelson Mandela himself; those who in many cases have not, unhappily, survived to savour the triumph. We remember on this occasion people like Steve Biko, Oliver Tambo, Walter Sisulu, Helen Suzman, Helen Joseph, Desmond Tutu and all those others who have spent their lives, or given their lives, working to bring dignity to oppressed and disadvantaged South Africans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today is also a day to particularly honour former President F.W. de Klerk who had the courage to make the break with the past and who, despite virulent opposition from those who had most to lose by the destruction of apartheid, steadfastly refused to be deflected from the path to non-racial democracy. We admire the grace with which, in conceding defeat in the election, Mr de Klerk pledged not only his cooperation but his friendship to Nelson Mandela. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today is also a day to record the satisfaction which Australians can reasonably feel at the role our country played in bringing about the new South Africa&mdash;of course, we were never alone in this respect in the international community. But it was the Commonwealth that provided much of the moral and political leadership for the international anti-apartheid movement for many years, and within the Commonwealth it was Australia&mdash;at least from the early 1970s&mdash;which played a particularly prominent role along with, especially, India, Canada, Malaysia and the front line African states in giving political and intellectual leadership to that movement. Opposition to apartheid has been a bipartisan matter in Australia for many years. It is therefore especially appropriate, given the major role which was played by each of their governments, that both Mr Fraser and Mr Hawke should be today representing Australia at the inauguration of President Mandela. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sanctions against South Africa have a long history, going back to India's trade ban in 1946. Australia first played a role in this respect when Gough Whitlam announced in December 1972 that sporting teams selected on the basis of race would not be allowed to enter Australia. It is now generally acknowledged that the sports boycott&mdash;strengthened subsequently in 1977 by the Fraser government following Gleneagles, and in 1983 by the Hawke government&mdash;made a crucial psychological contribution to the change process by driving home year after year to the sports-mad white South African community just how internationally isolated and despised their country had become as a result of apartheid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, Australia played a leading role in instituting the trade and investment sanctions agreed at the Nassau Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in 1985. The first tranche, imposed immediately, included bans on new government loans to the South African government, on the import of krugerrands, on government funding for trade promotion, on the export of computer equipment, and on the sale of oil. The second tranche, imposed following the mission to South Africa of the eminent persons group in 1986&mdash;which was co-led by Malcolm Fraser&mdash;included bans on air links with South Africa, on the import of agricultural products, on new investment or the reinvestment of profits earned in South Africa, and on government procurement from South African sources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1987, attention turned primarily to financial sanctions&mdash;the denial or limitation of credit to South African government agencies or companies by other governments and by the private banking sector internationally. It was former Prime Minister Bob Hawke at the 1987 Vancouver CHOGM who initiated the groundbreaking expert study on the impact of financial sanctions which became widely influential in international financial circles, and which subsequently influenced a wider global public still to understand the centrality of these sanctions when it was published&mdash;again at Australian initiative&mdash;by Penguin in 1989 with the title <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Apartheid and international finance</EMPHASIS>, written by Keith Ovenden and Tony Cole. Ultimately it was financial sanctions more than anything else that drove the South African government to the negotiating table&mdash;and this has been frankly acknowledged by South African ministers and officials on many occasions over the last four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since former President de Klerk's historic speech on 2 February 1990 launching the reform process, Australia has continued, right through until last month's election, to be active in supporting the movement to full democracy. Through the Commonwealth Foreign Ministers on Southern Africa committee we were active in developing the strategy for phased lifting of sanctions as the reform process proceeded through its various stages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also used our aid program to provide assistance in building up the skills and expertise that are needed in the country's democratic and political institutions. We have provided education and training especially in relation to the electoral process, economic planning and policy, and in the development of the media. I put on record the government's appreciation for the role played by various Australian non-government organisations, including in particular APHEDA, Austcare, the World Council of Churches and its constituent members, and the UNICEF committee of Australia, in delivering that assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians also played an important and useful part in the election process itself, and I would like to place on record the thanks of the government to all those who contributed in this respect. I mention particularly John Cain, Philip Ruddock, Janine Haines, Professor Duncan Chappell and Australian Electoral Commissioner Brian Cox, who participated in the work of the Commonwealth observer group. Australia provided staff from the Australian Electoral Commission and the Australian Federal Police to assist the South African Independent Electoral Commission and the Goldstone commission. There were many other Australians who served in United Nations observer groups, sometimes in extremely difficult and chaotic circumstances. They all deserve our very warm thanks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The election held in the last two weeks of April was a truly remarkable event in the all too fragile history of democratic elections. I know honourable members will agree that watching the election, even from thousands of miles away, was an inspiring experience. The overall impression was of an irrepressible ground swell of popular support for the election process, with millions of people queuing often for interminable periods to cast their votes. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said in his statement last week, it was the spirit of reconciliation and forgiveness shown by all parties, especially those who were victims of apartheid, which made this election so remarkable. Certainly, there were organisational problems both in the conduct of the election and also in the counting, but there can be no doubt that it was, as certified by Judge Kriegler, the head of the Independent Electoral Commission, `substantially free and fair,' and certainly amounted to a quite unequivocal expression of the people's will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Transcending all the administrative difficulties was the pervading spirit of joy and freedom that accompanied the voting. The election brought with it a measure of calm and a significant reduction in the level of political violence. There was remarkable patience all round, and for perhaps cynical and election-weary Australians this election&mdash;like the Cambodian election before it last year&mdash;was a powerful reminder of the value of, and the weight placed by ordinary people in every country upon, the basic democratic freedom: the right to vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, following that election, the new government of national unity assumes the awesome responsibility of addressing the daunting challenges facing the new South Africa. It will be faced with the task of developing new law enforcement structures and strategies to combat the violence which has claimed so many lives in recent years. It will have to oversee the establishment of new national and provincial government structures; it will have to resolve the problems that still exist in KwaZulu and Natal; and it will have to deal somehow with the pressures that still exist, dwindling though they may be, for a white Volkstaat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will, of course, also have to begin to tackle the massive task of redressing the economic and social inequalities of the apartheid legacy. The success of the new South Africa will to a great extent depend on whether the government can pursue sound economic policies while at the same time responding positively and constructively to the pent-up expectations of disadvantaged South Africans&mdash;many of them no doubt now unrealistically high&mdash;for better housing, education, health services and job opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recognising the huge task now facing South Africa as it finds its feet as a new nation, and the difficulties involved in even beginning to satisfy expectations from the country's internal resources, the international community has to continue to provide significant assistance so that South Africa can develop the new structures of government that are required, do something to meet the demands for social justice that are so pent up and begin creating the conditions for long-term economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia welcomes the announcements that have been made over the last few days by the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan, among others, that they are to increase their economic assistance to South Africa. I am pleased to now announce that the Australian government will also be increasing its aid to South Africa. We have decided to undertake a new aid program which will involve the expenditure of $30 million over the next three years. This represents a 35 per cent increase in aid flows to South Africa over previous years. This level of assistance will allow us to consolidate and continue the important nation-building assistance and skills development we have extended to date. It will also enable the development of new programs of assistance in the vitally important area of providing basic needs and infrastructure for the underprivileged majority so grossly disadvantaged for so long by apartheid. Australia will take an active part in the international coordination of the substantial resources that will need to be mobilised to achieve the economic objectives of the new government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be moving quickly to arrange for discussions with the new government of national unity on the early implementation of this new program. Our current thinking is that our new program should consist of three main components:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">good governance, building the capacity of blacks and institutional strengthening, which would include continuing support for the media and economic policy and planning, and developing public sector management skills at the national, regional and local level;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">human resource development, including training awards in Australia, short-term in-country training and support for the programs of international organisations such as the Commonwealth; and,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">helping meet the basic needs of disadvantaged people, including programs to provide low-cost housing, safe water and sanitation, prefabricated buildings, urban and rural settlement planning and design, and infrastructure planning, particularly in the health sector. </PARA>
<PARA>In providing our assistance to South Africa, I believe there will be an important role&mdash;and opportunity&mdash;for the Australian private sector in contributing its technology and expertise, particularly in areas such as low-cost housing, sanitation and safe water, health care, roads and electricity. More generally, Australian companies will be looking to take advantage of the new trade opportunities that the full return of South Africa to the international community, and the expected faster growth of the country, will now bring. We clearly should not have unrealistic expectations about this, not least because the basic structure of the South African economy is more competitive than complementary to our own, but the opportunities will be there and it will be in the interests of both countries if we make the most of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the longer term, Australia will be looking to develop a new partnership not only with South Africa but with India and the other countries of South Asia, and other Indian Ocean rim countries, in developing a new sense of regional identity and regional cooperation in economic and political development. The new South African government of national unity will obviously be largely preoccupied with the country's domestic agenda in the short and medium term. However, I am confident that from today, with the burden of shame lifted, South Africa will be able to play an increasingly important international role, providing leadership not only on the African continent but in the Indian Ocean region and, more generally, in the global community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In just a few hours Nelson Mandela will become President of a newly liberated South Africa.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a day for celebration of an immense achievement. It is a day of great hope. It is a day to mark the full return of a country to the embrace of the international community. It is a day when I am sure that all members&mdash;indeed, all Australians&mdash;will embrace Nelson Mandela's prayer that the healing and reconciliation that is now taking place in South Africa will continue. It is a day when all of us in Australia wish the new President and all the people of South Africa a future of equality, peace and prosperity, for which so many of them have so desperately, and so justly, yearned for so long. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;On behalf of the coalition, I congratulate President-elect Mandela and the African National Congress on their election victory and the installation of the first democratic government in South Africa. On behalf of the coalition, I congratulate Vice President-elect de Klerk and his supporters for their courage in rejecting a political system which guaranteed their economic and political privileges. In so doing, they made the transition to democracy possible. On behalf of the coalition, I congratulate the people of South Africa for the manner in which they attained their freedom in a free and fair democratic election in which the overwhelming majority of citizens participated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The holding of democratic elections in South Africa and the establishment of a coalition government under President Mandela marked the close of a tragic and heroic epoch in South Africa's history. This epoch saw the defeat of the apartheid system by a people demanding the most fundamental political right&mdash;that of a voice in the government of their country. Not only did apartheid deny the vote to the majority of South Africa's population, it also discriminated against that majority in every other conceivable way. In particular, it denied that majority the right to even a basic standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this struggle, the apartheid regime defended itself with tenacity and brutality. Thousands of its opponents died or were tortured and imprisoned. Nor was the violence confined to South Africa. All the front-line states of Southern Africa&mdash;Angola, Namibia and Mozambique in particular&mdash;suffered as the apartheid regime strove to prevent the emergence of governments which would not collaborate with it. The honour of having defeated this iniquitous system goes principally to those courageous people who confronted it directly. We are all rightly familiar with the names Mandela, Biko, Tambo and Suzman, and the roles these people played in the struggle, but the victory over apartheid also represents the triumph of thousands of others, such as those killed at Sharpeville, who did not live to witness the dawn of democracy in South Africa. The international community also helped bring about the transition from apartheid to democracy in South Africa. As I have said, the defeat of apartheid was principally the work of South Africans, but international sanctions helped convince the regime that it simply could not persist in denying black South Africans their freedom. By making it impossible for the regime to carry on the range of financial, trade, cultural and sporting contact with the international community necessary for national viability, sanctions powerfully reinforced the internal impetus for change within South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For more than two decades Australia has played an important part in this system of sanctions. I take pride in the prominent role played by the coalition government in the 1970s and early 1980s. As foreign minister, I participated in numerous conferences on racism and apartheid. In particular, I participated as foreign minister to Malcolm Fraser as Prime Minister at the 1977 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, when the Gleneagles agreement on sporting contacts with South Africa&mdash;which was a significant blow to apartheid&mdash;was drafted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In saying that, I have to pause and mention to the House the role that Malcolm Fraser played. I served in this parliament for a long time with Malcolm Fraser. I resigned from his cabinet. I had more disagreements with Malcolm Fraser than were even published during the stormy period of our relationship. But I have a pride in what I witnessed in Malcolm Fraser's work in this direction and I have a personal pride in having been associated with it from almost its germination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have read the theories as to why Malcolm was so possessed on this issue. I think I know better than anybody else when this matter really commenced. I worked with him very closely from 1975 until the day I resigned from his cabinet on this very issue. For all the disagreements I have had&mdash;I have publicly said elsewhere that I was the major contributing factor in those disagreements; to this day, I regret that I resigned from his ministry&mdash;I never wavered in my admiration for him on this issue. It was not easy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are a liberal party, but we are, as some use the phrase today, a broad church. Malcolm Fraser had to fight many on this side when he started to implement the sorts of firm reforms which he sought. The aspirations that he as an Australian had for South Africa were not always shared by every other Australian either on this side or, in part, by some on the other side of the House. As was his wont when he was determined to fight an issue, he did it with extraordinary courage and very great gusto. It is a matter of pride that I was able to work with him in total agreement and in the full spirit of the pursuit of a freedom which then was just a dream to so many in South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could speak at very great length on this issue, but I do not want to. But if the House understands that I have a little touch of feeling on this issue as a result of that difficult period, it may comprehend the difficult and different personality of Malcolm Fraser. One could be on such a wavelength with him on issues such as this but in disagreement with him on certain other issues. To see him participate in the celebrations in South Africa with Bob Hawke is a matter of pride for me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we reflect additionally, it is truly a matter of pride for this parliament. Regrettably, we do not often have much pride in this place, because, unlike other countries, we do not involve ourselves in the same bipartisan spirit on great issues on which we ought to. This is one on which we can justifiably be non-critical of one another and say to one another, `We help one another in the pursuit of this issue. It is the South Africans who are deserving of the credit. But to the extent that there was assistance by the international community, we all did it in a non-partisan way in this House.'</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The apartheid era is closed, and the transition to democracy has proceeded more peacefully and successfully than many dared hope. But South Africans now face challenges as daunting as those they have just overcome. Despite the achievement of democracy, there is no room for complacency about South Africa's future. President-elect Mandela's government will face the enormous task of satisfying the aspirations of black South Africans. The economic development agenda now facing South Africa is one of providing employment and meeting the basic housing, health, infrastructure and educational needs of the black community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In discussions with ANC representatives, I have been impressed with the clarity and resolution which they are showing and with which they are approaching the task ahead. But in addition to economic development, further political consolidation and reconciliation will be required in South Africa. I have already welcomed elsewhere the fact that at the last moment all but the most recalcitrant shades of opinion in South Africa elected to join the democratic process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this new consensus in South Africa must now be translated into enduring democratic processes and institutions. The permanent South African constitution to be adopted in 1999 will be drafted in an extensive, deliberative and consultative process extending over two years. So there are good grounds for the hope that the spirit of cooperation and reconciliation, which has been so strikingly demonstrated in recent weeks, will endure and lay the foundations for a prosperous and stable South Africa. </PARA>

If we have it written down, perhaps one of my colleagues, such as the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), could read it to the House. I suggest that it could state something along the lines that this House notes the success of the historic South African elections and wishes the government and the people of South Africa much success in their brave new endeavours, or words to that effect. I would be happy to bow to the government moving something along those lines, and I would be pleased to sign the motion as a seconder, as a deliberate expression of the feeling that would be embraced by all members of this House in both congratulating the government and wishing the people well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I welcome this opportunity to support the statement by the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) today with the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as the first president of a democratic South Africa. It is for many people throughout the world the culmination of many years of endeavour and, for many, a dream fulfilled. But whatever our own feelings in rejoicing, this cannot compare with the joy that our brothers and sisters in the democratic republic of South Africa must feel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The black people of South Africa have endured years of struggle. Unfortunately, many of them are not here to celebrate with us today. Years of struggle and brutality against an unfair and unjust system have thinned the ranks of those left to celebrate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A personal friend of mine with whom I studied in London was killed in South Africa through the brutality of the system. I think knowing this person was what first got me interested all those years ago in the whole situation in South Africa. He was the most talented of our group at university. I could never understand why he would not be permitted to take his rightful place and make the necessary contribution that his ability demanded on his return to South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I remember the day he returned to South Africa. A group of 15 or 20 of us were at London airport. Black and white, men and women, he went around us all and kissed each of us. He then looked at us and said, `If I did that where I will be in a few hours, I would be put in gaol.' Sadly, in less than a year after returning to South Africa he was dead. The system killed him. So much talent was wasted. The tragedy is that it happens so many times&mdash;too many times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But today is not the day to harp on the past. Today is the day to look forward to the future. I pay tribute to the tremendous courage of former president, F.W. de Klerk, and the many from all races who worked so hard and with so much goodwill for this day to be achieved. South Africa will be a country where every citizen can reach their full potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As others have said, the challenges facing South Africa are immense, the expectations are great and, like others, I think they are far too high to be quickly fulfilled. Of course there will be periods of pain. There will be times of despair. But I am certain that South Africa will achieve the goal that so many want for that country&mdash;a country that has suffered so much and now has the opportunity to live in peace, to reach its full potential and to take its rightful place in the community. Be it at international forums such as the United Nations or at sporting venues, democratic South Africa will play its part. South Africans face the future in a spirit of reconciliation and forgiveness. The African ability for forgiveness never ceases to amaze me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many Australians have also worked hard for this day. We must take nothing away from the South Africans; it is their day but, as other speakers have said, many Australians have also worked hard for this day. I support the comments made by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) about the former Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser and the tremendous contribution he made. I also pay tribute to the honourable member for Kooyong for the tremendous work he did in this field. I have long admired the work that the honourable member for Kooyong did in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is most appropriate that both former Prime Minister Fraser and former Prime Minister Hawke are in Pretoria today for the inauguration of Nelson Mandela. We also remember the work of former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, chairperson of Australians for Democracy in South Africa&mdash;an organisation of which I have been a member. I also mention the work of Prime Minister Keating, Foreign Minister Gareth Evans and the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs. Many people from both sides of this House have contributed in this area. A bipartisan approach has been taken on the question of apartheid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to all my colleagues in this chamber who, along with me, have been members of Australian Parliamentarians Against Apartheid. Over the years, we have welcomed to this building many of those involved in the struggle. This morning I was looking through the list of cabinet ministers; it is amazing how many of them we have welcomed and entertained within this building. Our group, Australian Parliamentarians Against Apartheid, will now cease. I am not saying that apartheid has finished, but I do not think it appropriate for us to continue our group. Hopefully, as with so many groups in this parliament, we will form a friendship group between the parliament of Australia and the parliament of the Democratic Republic of South Africa. When we do that we will hopefully be amongst the first in the world to form a friendship group with a new parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also pay tribute to my friends in the Australian trade union movement who have played a magnificent role in this long struggle. The Maritime Union of Australia, be it the seafarers or the waterside workers, supported the cause for justice in South Africa long before it was fashionable to do so. They have been unwavering in their support. Those in the CFMEU, the miners federation, have over many years made the struggle for democracy in South Africa their own struggle. The whole trade union movement has played a magnificent role, especially AFEDA, as indeed have many individuals, as well as non-government organisations and the churches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today is not the end of the struggle. South Africa will need us more than ever before. I know that I join all members of this parliament&mdash;indeed, people throughout the world&mdash;in wishing the newly elected president, Nelson Mandela, well in the challenges that will face him as, indeed, I wish the democratic, multiracial South Africa peace, justice and economic prosperity in the challenging years that lie ahead.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I remember when I first came into this place hearing the then Foreign Minister&mdash;subsequent Governor-General&mdash;Lord Casey, comment, `There is no more heady wine than the spirit of new found independence.' I think to that might well be added, in the present context, the phrase, `There is no more heady wine than the new found freedom of a democratic election.' That certainly is true of the events in South Africa. Those of us from across the Indian Ocean who have looked at the events over the years have despaired at the violence that seems endemic, at the degree to which apartheid seemed to have entrenched a division between people quite anathema to any recognition of the equality that all of us see as part of our democratic way of life, and one that we believe should apply universally around the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As each of those who have spoken in this place today on this matter have done, I congratulate President-elect Mandela and the members of his new government on the spirit in which the elections have been conducted, on the manifest determination of a significant majority of the people within that country to achieve a new democracy and to set aside the divisions of the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to the former president, F.W. de Klerk, who has been an extraordinarily remarkable man. There is little doubt that, for one who sets himself up against the very basis of the party which elected him initially and which he has represented, to change the ground rules which his party has followed for so long takes bravery of a significant order. Over the years, former President de Klerk has shown a remarkable determination and a considerable personal initiative in quite extraordinary circumstances, which I think we all recognise and to which we pay tribute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, nothing should take from the new president, Nelson Mandela, the acclaim that I think the world properly gives to one who spent so much of his time in gaol; to one who, having emerged from that gaol, showed an equanimity personally that I must admit I found quite extraordinary. As one who has met many of the leaders of this world in the time in which I have been in this place, I regard President Mandela as an exceptional human being. He is a person who, having overcome the travails of his hardship within gaol, has been able to give leadership and maintain leadership on a sensible basis, not only to those of his particular party&mdash;the ANC&mdash;but across the breadth of South Africa. The world now waits with interest and expectation the product of his election. We all wish him and those with him well as they face those enormous challenges ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As did my colleague the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), I want to say a few things about those earlier days when the Gleneagles agreement was negotiated and when matters were put in place which ultimately led to the democratic election and the setting aside of apartheid. Unlike the honourable member for Kooyong, I tended to be on the other side of our former colleague Malcolm Fraser on matters pertaining to southern African politics. My own background was such that I saw that, more often than not, placing embargoes on any country led to the disadvantaged suffering to a greater degree than the advantaged. I was quite apprehensive when the Gleneagles agreement was negotiated that the people who were going to suffer most were the black majority whom we all felt were the disadvantaged in South Africa. That that was not so and that I was wrong and Malcolm Fraser and Andrew Peacock right is reflected in the elections in South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the Gleneagles accord and the embargoes that were placed on the government of the then white South Africa certainly contributed towards the resolution of the problems of apartheid and towards the events which eventuated in Nelson Mandela's election. I acknowledge and would like to pay tribute to Malcolm Fraser for the leadership he gave in those days towards the first process of which today is the fulfilment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also pay tribute to subsequent Prime Minister Bob Hawke and the role that he played. As the honourable member for Kooyong remarked, it was really, I thought, symptomatic of what many of us would see as essential; that is, on issues of fundamental national importance, there should be an accord between the two sides of parliament, between all of the parties and people within them. Bipartisanship in matters of this character is very much in the long-term interest of the South African-Australian relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do well to remember that the origins of South Africa and Australia after all were as members of the then British Empire, subsequently the British Commonwealth and hopefully, with the potential readmission of South Africa into the Commonwealth, of a continuing association of nations. The association of those Commonwealth countries is one where the rule of law prevails; where there is a democratic basis for the election of governments; where there is a recognition that human rights are sacrosanct; and where the government's commission against individuals of acts which cannot be sustained as proper practice needs properly to be condemned. I believe that South Africa, as a result of the election now conducted there, has properly reached that stage where it should again become a member of that Commonwealth club. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the present and for the future, I was pleased in the minister's statement to hear of the development assistance the government offers. I was even more pleased to hear that the minister has suggested that, in tonight's budget, we will not be disappointed; that there are funds to be made available to supplement the government's other aid programs in order to ensure that assistance can be given to the new government of South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">South Africa does have fundamental problems still to face. As its people face those challenges of personal division, continued violence and fundamentally different attitudes within the provinces of that nation, we certainly look towards their resolution without the violence that tragically has been so much a part of the way of life there over the course of the last decade or so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I would join with the minister and with the honourable member for Kooyong and other members of this place in wishing the people and the government of South Africa well. I hope that, in our common accord around the Indian rim, we might find new prospects for democratic advancement, for the progress of people and, hopefully, for trade, commerce and economic progress in which we all might share. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to rise this afternoon and support the statement which has been made by the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) and the remarks of others who have spoken here today. Honourable members have mentioned the need for us to come together on this issue. I think that is quite evident from comments that have been made here today. It certainly is evident from the minister's statement today and the comments of Prime Ministers of Australia since Gough Whitlam.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister pointed out in his statement, in December 1972 Gough Whitlam announced that sporting teams selected on the basis of race would not be allowed to enter Australia. To the great credit of Malcolm Fraser and Bob Hawke since&mdash;and, of course Prime Minister Keating&mdash;they also supported the cause of the South African people. I certainly acknowledge their contributions. I am pleased that Malcolm Fraser and Bob Hawke have had the opportunity to be in South Africa at this very important time for the South African people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyone who has witnessed the historic events which have taken place in South Africa in recent times could not fail to be moved by the promise of a new age in what has been, up to now, a sadly disadvantaged country. I am sure all members of this House would agree with me when I say that the recent election result heralds a bright new future in what can now, quite justifiably, be called a new country. As other members have said here today, it will not be easy. The honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) rightly has said, `It is not the end of the struggle, but I see it as the beginning'&mdash;the beginning of a new future for South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst members here today have acknowledged the bipartisan attitude of members of this place, certainly over recent years, I, as a member of the Australian Labor Party,  would like to make a few comments in relation to the Australian Labor Party's contribution. As a member of the Labor Party, I am proud to be able to say that the Labor government played an important role in the history making election in South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the South African election, 18 million South Africans voted for the first time in an election that was not just about policies or economics but also about the fundamental freedom of human beings. The significance of this occurrence is underscored when one realises that Nelson Mandela, one of the most distinguished elder statesmen in world affairs, cast the first vote of his life at the age of 75 years. This fact makes the election in South Africa all that more significant. I am sure honourable members in this place, and probably all Australians, will recall the image of Nelson Mandela casting his first vote at the age of 75 years. That is something we as Australians, unfortunately, often take for granted&mdash;the simple right to vote. Perhaps there is a message for all Australians in the events which have occurred in South Africa in recent times: we should not take for granted the right to vote. I will always remember that image of Nelson Mandela casting his first vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">South Africa, for the first time in its history, under an African National Congress dominated government, can now pursue a democratic future for all South Africans. The people can at last set about building a just and tolerant society, where the rights of the individual are protected and where all citizens are equal, free and secure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many members of this House would no doubt have fond memories of Mr Mandela's visit to Australia in 1991 when he thanked the government and the people of this country for their support. Indeed, I attended a dinner held in his honour in the Great Hall, which I am sure many members here today would have attended as well. I, like other members, was lucky enough to meet this remarkable statesman and shake his hand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said before, I am proud of the assistance rendered to the ANC in the election period in South Africa by the Australian government and the Australian people, and of course by the Australian Labor Party. Can I express the pride I felt when recently I received a letter of thanks from Mr Mandela, as did all members of the Australian Labor Party. I will quote from that letter, as I think it spells out a lot of things. It is dated 24 April 1994. Mr Mandela said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This week, 18 million South Africans will vote for the very first time! In an election that is not merely a contest between different political organisations, but a contest about freedom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since its inception the ANC has been committed to the creation of a non-racial, democratic South Africa. A South Africa that will protect the rights of the individual, while building a nation in which all are equal and secure.</PARA>
<PARA>The leadership and vision which have been shown by Nelson Mandela and, of course, F.W. de Klerk, who has been mentioned here today as well, and the ANC should be applauded by all people, as should the courage and wisdom of the majority of South Africans, black and white, for opting for change&mdash;a change for the better, of course. The events of the last week in South Africa have symbolised endurance and the ultimate triumph of the human spirit. Despite overwhelming difficulties for government and electoral workers, including the very real risk of serious violence, they performed their duties admirably and the result has been a successful election, despite some minor practical problems to which the minister referred earlier. The organisation of the ANC is to be congratulated for running a professional and committed campaign, as should be all parties involved in that election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not pretend for one moment that South Africa's future path will be smooth. I am sure we all realise that Mr Mandela and the new government face a difficult period in which their moves will be judged critically by impassive international financial markets which are not known for their reformist passion. But I believe that the ANC's commitment to policies, such as employment growth, housing and education for the black majority and, of course, all South Africans, will result in much needed changes in South Africa. It is clear that the ANC intends to deliver these far-reaching and long overdue reforms, but it faces a difficult time. It has to perform a delicate balancing act, weighing its commitment to these policies against the possible effects such policies may have on investment in that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we should applaud the sentiments expressed by Mr Mandela both prior to and after the election. He has said on numerous occasions that the ANC wants South Africa to progress and develop to the benefit of all South Africans, black and white. That is why it was pleasing to see reports in the media that Mr Mandela's government would not promote any policies that would discourage foreign investment. The South African election result should be welcomed by all Australians with an interest in justice and freedom. I applaud the commitment to democratic principles exhibited by the people in leadership in South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I make a couple of points. There are people, whom I have known over many years, who have had an interest in South Africa. I remember particularly an Irish Catholic priest, Father Joseph Burke, whom I met in Brisbane many years ago. It was Father Burke who told me about the great problems in South Africa when he was serving at the church in Durban. It was some 26 years ago that I met him and I am sure he would be pleased today to know that he is remembered. Unfortunately, he has passed on since then, but the plight of the South African people has been reversed and they now have a great future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has certainly been encouraging, I think. I mentioned Mr de Klerk earlier, but the courage he has shown must also be recognised. The support he has given Nelson Mandela is important for the future of South Africa. Mr de Klerk took on a very difficult thing in challenging his own party, as parties in this nation have had to challenge themselves. That has also been acknowledged earlier here today. As I said before, the future will not be easy for South Africa, but I am sure that the continued support of this nation and the international community generally for the people of South Africa will ensure a good future for South Africa and the South African people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased that the minister has announced a continuation of and an increase in aid to South Africa by the Australian government today. I am sure I join with many of my friends and certainly my family when I say to the people of South Africa: may God bless you. </PARA>

I take the liberty of quoting in part what former Prime Minister Hawke said last week in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. In an article entitled `South Africa's future looks bright despite the violence' he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wrote in February after a few days in South Africa that there would be ugly incidents of violence and disruption leading up to the election; but I believed that neither the far Right nor Buthelezi would have a sufficiently large constituency to prevent a valid election or, after the election, to create a sustained period of unmanageable civil warfare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those predictions have so far proved accurate and I believe my confidence as to the future is well-founded.

<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nelson Mandela will become President of the new South Africa as a result of an authentic democratic process in which he and the ANC were given proper recognition for their leadership in bringing the abhorrent system of apartheid to an end. Nothing in the conduct of the election will provide any substance for the extremists to question the Mandela mandate. The election has put the democratic seal upon his authority, which has been inexorably accumulating for a generation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This victory, so well established in past achievements, is no guarantee of future success. Many are sceptical but, again, I am optimistic about the future of South Africa under the new regime.</PARA>
<PARA>It is with a strong deal of bipartisanship that I stand here this evening to add my best wishes to President-elect Mandela's government of national unity and its theme of reconciliation. As he said recently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The time has come for men and women, Africans, coloureds, Indians, whites, Afrikaners and English-speaking, to say we are one country, we are one people . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I congratulate Nelson Mandela and the ANC, former President de Klerk and the National Party, Chief Buthelezi and the Inkatha Freedom Party and all the other minor parties that were involved in making the election of a few weeks ago the success that it clearly was.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I add my congratulations to the Australian governments of all political hues over the last 20 years, both at the governmental level and at the non-government organisational level, that have ensured that what is about to occur in a couple of hours time and the electoral processes of last month reach fruition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also add my congratulations in particular to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) and to the shadow minister for foreign affairs, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), who said recently that the new consensus in South Africa must now be translated into enduring democratic processes and institutions. He went on to say that the spirit of cooperation so strikingly demonstrated in recent weeks has given hope that this could be achieved, thereby laying the foundation for a prosperous and stable South Africa. I also highlight today's editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper, which in part stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the many challenges ahead for the new Government, perhaps two are most pressing. First, the South African Defence Force and the ANC military wing will have to be brought together under an effective command and respond professionally to any violence (KwaZulu/Natal remains a potential flashpoint). Second, the Government will have to try to begin to strike the right balance between satisfying black aspirations for better living conditions and reassuring investors that South Africa will pursue sustainable growth.</PARA>
<PARA>I know if he were here he would want to speak, but I also pay tribute to the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), who, were it not for a family bereavement, I am sure would be speaking on this particular statement. I thank him for his contribution most recently to the observer delegation of which he was part. Former Prime Minister Hawke, in the article I referred to earlier, also said:</PARA>

<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Nelson Mandela is fortunate to have De Klerk, a man of talent, committed to the success of this new democratic State. The sometimes-harsh campaign rhetoric between the two will give way to a constructive partnership between President Mandela and Vice President De Klerk working together to advance the interests of South Africa.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hawke went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally important is the attitude of reciprocal respect and mutual reliance between Mandela and the white business community.</PARA>
<PARA>The election has now passed, ending more than three centuries of government in South Africa based upon racial prejudice, but the future of South Africa remains uncertain. President-elect Mandela and his government face the daunting task of undoing the damage caused by more than 40 years of apartheid, of unifying the country and of raising the living standards of all South Africans to a level that the South African economy can sustain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The violence that has gripped South Africa in the months prior to the election suggests that these objectives will not be easily achieved. It has become evident since the April election that the election has meant different things to different people. Black South Africans, who have known no other life but poverty and oppression, see the poll as the beginning of a bright new future and are eager for these reforms to be made literally overnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Radical whites, on the other hand, are fearful of the implications of the election. The prospect of a South Africa dominated by blacks and coloured peoples does not accord with Afrikaner ideology of racial segregation. Coloured and Asian South Africans, however, are seemingly caught between the two&mdash;not wanting a return to apartheid but apprehensive of what a black dominated government will mean for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new government will need to carefully manage the differing expectations of the various political groups in South Africa. Contrary to the hopes of many black South Africans, the government will not be able to make significant changes overnight. Racial prejudice will not disappear with the change in government and it will take decades to significantly raise the current Third World living conditions of most black South Africans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Change could be hindered by the need of a government to direct some of its energies to the formulation of the new constitution by 1996 and by the ability of the economy to finance the upgrading of a civil infrastructure. Even a suggested redistribution of white wealth is unlikely to pay for the massive changes needed. South Africa will require generous aid from the international community. Like my colleagues, I support what the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney), who is at the table, said earlier in his opening speech.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition today wishes to air the most commonly discussed and most serious issue within the resources sector&mdash;the growing effect of sovereign risk on investment decisions made by both Australian and overseas companies in our mining and petroleum industries. Sovereign risk is the measurement of the security of a company's investment. It is most often used in regard to the resources sector. Whilst there is no universal definition of sovereign risk, I think it is best summarised as encompassing possible threats to the security of an investment&mdash;that is, is a company's investment in a country perfectly secure or is it threatened by government action in particular?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can judge sovereign risk against a number of standards, such as consistency and predicability of government policy, stability of government and society, and the political integrity of the government of the day. In Third World or developing countries, in judging sovereign risk we have to take into account the possibility of civil unrest, even civil war, corruption within government and possible nationalisation of investments in the resources sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia I, for one, believe that sovereign risk is best defined as changing the rules after the investment has been committed and after a resource project has commenced. We have seen, as honourable members will immediately realise, a number of government decisions relating to the taxation regime and relating to land access that have immediately affected the viability of investments undertaken in good faith and within the existing regime laid down by government at the time the decision was made to invest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of the resources sector to the Australian economy just cannot be overstated. Just consider these numbers. The mineral sector pays $2 1/2 billion in taxes to governments annually, the petroleum exploration and production industry pays $1 1/2 billion. That foots the bill for a lot of government programs that the community enjoys as a matter of course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the latest Bureau of Statistics figures, Australia's oil and gas production was worth $7.8 billion in 1992, a figure which dwarfs that of any other industry I can think of. But even more importantly, over 50 per cent of Australia's merchandise export earnings, some $29 billion annually, comes from mining and minerals processing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Copper, iron ore, precious metals, base metals, black coal, aluminium, mineral sands, even uranium&mdash;about which I will have something to say shortly&mdash;are critical to the nation's standard of living. These mining based exports are at the heart of the community's expectations as to what quality of life it can rightly expect. Yet the nation's dependence on the resources sector as our principal source of wealth has been gravely threatened by government policy over the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can best summarise the two general concerns of the mining and petroleum industries thus: firstly, their land access, and this involves access to land restricted because of unrealistic environmental standards, which the mining industry to date has always met and also restrictions brought about by Aboriginal claims on land; and, secondly, their problems in regard to cost. They are the two major issues common across all resource industries&mdash;land access and costs. Let me look at them to see how government actions have threatened sovereign risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at Mabo first. The major mining houses in this country have now placed on the public record their decision to explore and invest in far greater amounts overseas&mdash;away from Australia&mdash;because of Mabo. CRA exploration executive Dr Ian Gould said that his company had increased its overseas exploration budget by almost 50 per cent this year. Out of a $130 million exploration budget, CRA has earmarked $23 million for overseas projects compared with $14 million in 1993. Dr Gould said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have certainly reacted (to the Native Title legislation). We have had no real choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year we increased our overseas exploration budget by virtually 50 per cent and that money is money that is not being spent in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Western Mining, also one of the major players in the Australian mining industry, already spends more than one third of its $94 million exploration budget overseas. Roy Woodall, the exploration director of Western Mining, said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are spending money on ground which could be subject to Aboriginal claim . . . so our commitment in Australia could be less until the situation is clarified.</PARA>
<PARA>Western Mining has always intended to increase its offshore exploration. According to Mr Woodall, it was only a matter of how fast. BHP Minerals, the most dominant influence in Australian mining, has spent 40 per cent of its exploration effort in North America, compared with 24 per cent in Australia. BHP Minerals executive general manager, Jerry Ellis, said that the uncertainty of Mabo had eaten away the confidence of explorers in Australia and influenced his company's exploration policy. He said that the company's geologists were fast forming a `very jaundiced view' about exploring in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is impossible for the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall), who is at the table, to deny that sovereign risk is the most dominant issue of concern within his portfolio. I doubt that he can attend any industry forum without this matter being raised. I would not have thought that any member of the House of Representatives would ever have expected to debate the issue of sovereign risk in this country simply because it is such an alien concept and belongs more to the banana republics of the world, rather than Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mabo is an unholy mess. Under the complex legislation the approval processes are going to be extraordinarily drawn out, time consuming and expensive. The various states, which, under the constitution, have responsibility for land management, are unlikely to pass the necessary legislation to enable the process to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will turn now to the environmental approval procedures. The Resource Assessment Commission, to remind honourable members for it is so easy to forget the RAC, was to be the great white hope of sustainable development in this country. Now it is shortly to be axed by the government or confined to an irrelevant role, as it has been for some time. Examples are occurring at this very moment whereby the government is unable to make transparent and strong decisions regarding exploration because of environmental considerations of a purely political kind. These are not genuine environmental concerns, rather they are expedient and playing cynically to an extremist element which can never be satisfied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence of this can be found at Shoalwater Bay. There the Clinton Lowlands Joint Venture has been, at great expense, pilloried for a couple years now and still cannot get a decision in regard to mere exploration. Forget the development in the likely deposit of mineral sands. Even a lengthy and expensive commission of inquiry cannot yet reach a decision. We just want to know what is there. Then we and some of the competing interests can make an assessment as to its importance to the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will turn now to the issue of cost which affects sovereign risk for which Australia is constantly getting a downgraded assessment. Once, Australia was regarded as the best risk investment in the world. Ask anybody, particularly CRA, BHP and Western Mining Corporation, whether that is so now. In risk assessments lists circulated commonly on the international stage, Australia is falling lower and lower and closer and closer to the banana republics. This government is entirely to blame. It jeopardises the future of the nation such is the importance of the resources sector. The government cannot take the mining and oil industries for granted any longer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see Mount Isa Mines in north-west Argentina; several companies in Chile; BHP, with the largest copper mine in the world, in Chile; CRA, with giant coalmines, and BHP with coalmines in Kalimantan. Australian companies are investing more and more offshore over and above the level of internationalisation that we would want them to reach. They are leaving Australia because of domestic government policy. At the same time, a number of new countries, low cost producers, across all of the mineral sector are competing for us in a way that they have not done before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Latin America, west Africa, North America, South-East Asia and the Indian continent&mdash;all of them&mdash;are getting their act together in a way that we have not seen for decades. There is no margin for error when protecting our resources sectors. The government must take into account the instability now injected into the investment climate because of its somersault on a whole range of policy, whether it be in regard to land access, involving Mabo and the environment, or whether it be in regard to the cost regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister would appreciate, the decision of whether or not a company invests in a project is due to a constellation of factors. There is whole range of factors, but some are more important than others. The large players find that Mabo, with its inherent uncertainties, complexities and expense, is the last element that will drive them offshore. If they find gift-wrapped rich ore in Australia, they will go ahead and mine in Australia. These companies are not deserting Australia entirely such is the wealth of our natural resources. But they are out of Australia for the marginal or grey projects. The government is responsible. It is selling out the future of generations to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no certain tax regime yet as it affects the petroleum industry. Let us look at Esso and BHP Petroleum. The Tuna field in Bass Strait is now part of the political lexicon of the petroleum industry. There was $200 million or $300 million in disputed oil excise lost to those joint ventures because the government retrospectively legislated to erase its own mistake. Moreover, we have seen the introduction of the resources rent tax, which discriminates against gas produced out of Bass Strait, costing the joint venturers, Esso and BHP, $100 million a year. This is now the subject of intense arbitration and disagreement between the producers and the purchasers, the Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria. That rent resources tax applies only to Bass Strait and will eventually, one way or another, push up the cost of gas to customers in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a government policy vacuum in this area. We need stable policy settings. We have had four ministers for resources within four years. That is hardly a recipe for a stable policy regime. Let us look at the government's other failures which create this uncertainty and which hold back investment. The abolition of the Coal Industry Tribunal is 10 years too late. It has come about after three national strikes within eight months, which cost $26 million a day. It was forced to reform in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Electricity reform is too slow and uneven across the states. There is no lasting agreement with the states on the National Grid Management Council. An amount of $100 million was allocated in One Nation for restructuring the electricity industry. Less than $10 million has been required so far because of lack of progress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen four years of repeated attempts to sell off the Moomba to Sydney gas pipeline. The legislation is still hopelessly drafted. Negotiations are continuing and nothing is certain yet. The Interstate Gas Pipelines Bill had to be withdrawn some months ago because nobody, least of all the industry, could understand it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not touched on uranium or on the continental margins program in the oil industry, but the industry knows that sovereign risk is the greatest deterrent to investment at any time in the history of the resources sector. It is a new phenomenon in Australian investment and it is a very worrying one which the government cannot afford to ignore. It is within the government's hands to create the stability and certainty that is necessary to restore confidence. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate on the matter of public importance raised by the shadow minister for resources and energy, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran). I read with interest the wording of the matter of public importance today. I think it says a lot about the hyperbole in this debate that we are actually saying that there is sovereign risk within Australia. The shadow minister said that he found it difficult to find a definition of the term `sovereign risk'. It was not too hard. Reuters, which will clarify terminology for all those who subscribe, defines it as:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sovereign risk is where the government will default on its loan or fail to honour other business commitments.</PARA>
<PARA>Does the shadow minister seriously think that Australia falls into that category? What kind of perverse joke is that? More damning for this MPI, the definition goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It leads to banks observing limits on the amount of lending they will make to government organisations.</PARA>
<PARA>I would contend that that is a nonsense. The underlying assumption of this MPI is that investment is on the decline in the resources sector in Australia. This is a total nonsense. The shadow minister knows that only too well. He referred to Australian mining companies looking offshore. Of course they should be looking offshore. I said in this parliament only last week that Australian mining companies are the world leaders. BHP is the biggest mining company in the world. It has its base here in Australia and it can explore overseas, as it should. The shadow minister knows that and so does BHP. </PARA>

As I said at the AMIC seminar last week&mdash;and the figures are indisputable&mdash;we are investing about 30 per cent of our exploration dollar offshore. We have been doing that for many years. There is no sudden change because of the native title legislation. The companies are growing and becoming very large. As we know, in the last 10 years, BHP's capitalisation has increased from about $5 billion to $30 billion. This is a transnational Australian company of great talent and I give it great praise. I have visited many of its sites, as has the shadow minister. It is a very good petroleum company and it is a very good mining company.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the opposition's assertions, particularly with respect to sovereign risk, are quite silly. We do not want to get this type of emotive terminology in a debate. Terminology of this type lends itself to a debate that we do not need to have. We are not a sovereign risk. As the shadow minister knows, an enormous amount of exploration is going on in our region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in this parliament last week, despite all of the offshore exploration by Australian owned and Australian based companies and some people who are joint venturers in this country, 20 per cent of the total exploration dollar in the world is still spent in Australia. That is a significant amount of exploration. Sure, other companies are looking for exploration dollars in the Asian region, and we will see enormous growth in the demand for minerals in the next 20 to 25 years. The Asian region will grow to about 25 per cent of the world economy by the year 2000 and 50 per cent of the world economy by the year 2050. That is where the growth in the world is. It will be minerals that feed that growth. Those minerals will be found not only in Australia but also overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give a good example of how this government, in consultation with governments of different political persuasions, is helping the industry to grow. I recently had the opportunity to visit the Carpentaria-Mount Isa region. I do not know whether the shadow minister has been there, but I am sure the people there would facilitate a visit. It is an excellent place to look at what is happening in Australia. There is cooperation between the Commonwealth government, the Northern Territory government, the Queensland government and five of Australia's largest mining companies&mdash;Placer Pacific, MIM, BHP, CRA and Western Mining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I visited that region, I had the opportunity to look at some significant projects. The Century mine is a CRA project. I note the comment by the shadow minister that CRA has expressed a lot of concern about native title, but ironically when I was at the Century mine it announced that it was going ahead with the project. I looked at native title issues with the CRA personnel. They were able to show me sacred sites. They were concerned about that. This is a $750 million project. The Century mine is still being explored. It is in the final phase of exploration. It is not complete. It is a large zinc, lead, silver and ore body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Cannington mine, which is down the road a bit&mdash;in North Queensland terms, about 300 or 400 kilometres&mdash;is a joint BHP-MIM venture. The Cannington mine will take about $225 million to come on stream. It is in its final feasibility phase and final exploration phase. When Cannington comes on stream, as I am sure it will, it will be the largest silver mine in the world. It has enormous resources. The exploration is still going on. Native title issues exist there. CRA is continuing with that. Ernest Henry is another mine with MIM and, as we know, Savage Resources. It has had a lot of publicity in recent times. That again is a significant project in copper and gold. There are other projects up there, such as the Macarthur River, which is an example of how government can work with the indigenous population to get an outcome. Those are the sorts of outcomes that I want to see happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has deliberately set out to achieve and create the right sorts of conditions for industry to operate and grow and build Australia's world competitive companies. We should all be proud of how good this industry is, and I have told the industry that I am going to work on the promotion of that. The industry concedes that its public image is not what it should be. This country is nothing without the mining industry. I am one of the people who strongly advocates that, as the shadow minister knows. I do not dispute his figures. In fact, I think he probably understates the value of the resources sector to the economy. It is one of those things that we have been doing for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have some data on where Australian mining companies are operating. BHP Minerals operates in Brazil, Chile, the US, Canada, Indonesia, Mali and Papua New Guinea. CRA operates in Indonesia and PNG. Western Mining&mdash;which is in gold&mdash;operates in Brazil, Canada and the US. MIM operates in PNG, Canada, Peru, Mexico and now Argentina. It also has a zinc smelter and a manufacturing plant in the UK and an interest in a proposed zinc and lead smelter in Japan. Comalco, which is a subsidiary of CRA, has a bauxite interest in West Africa, an aluminium refinery in Italy and a smelter in New Zealand. This is the very solid base on which our industry has grown because of the domestic base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many years Australia has taught the world how to expand the industry. The money is not just coming from the mining industry. As the shadow minister knows, out of this mining industry has grown a great service sector and a great manufacturing sector. When I was minister for small business, I had the opportunity to visit Elphinstones in Burnie. Elphinstones produces some of the best underground mining equipment in the world. It grew because of our minerals industry. We are seeing enormous exploration in gold. I hate to remind people of what they said about the doom and gloom of the gold tax. As the shadow minister knows, gold is doing reasonably well. We would all like to have shares in goldmines. </PARA>

I know of a person&mdash;and I will not embarrass this person by revealing the name of the company&mdash;who is currently getting about $A500 an ounce and making a profit of $135 an ounce. So this person thinks gold is a pretty good industry to be in at the moment, and we certainly hope that continues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also put in place a number of measures for the mining sector that I think have had a significant positive impact. Those are: freeing up foreign investment guidelines; moving export controls on almost all minerals and streamlining the administration of those that remain; funding research work by CSIRO to remove technology impediments to the emergence of an Australian magnesium metal industry; accelerating the national geoscientific mapping program; and the funding of the Carpentaria-Mount Isa mineral province study that I mentioned before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to native title and the issues of land access. Native title is said by some in the resource sector to be the principal cause of uncertainty about investment. I would like to quote from what the industry itself now says. Many in the industry are taking a much more positive view of native title. From the Australian diamond conference in Perth, Michael Thomson of Ayres Reed Ltd said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Native title concern stems mainly from the novelty of the Mabo legislation: previously there was no platform for negotiation with Aborigines. Deals will be done and will help rebuild confidence. Sustainable mining should be good for all concerned and provided mining is to the benefit of Aborigines, why should they impede it? We believe mining in Australia is competitive.</PARA>
<PARA>The point is that Australia is by no means unique in having these types of what the opposition calls `impediments'. Issues of protecting the environment and respecting indigenous people's rights are surfacing in more and more countries: the USA; Canada; New Zealand; recently, Papua New Guinea; Latin America; and even the old former Soviet Union. They are issues that are not going away; they are ones of international concern. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QE4">Mr BEDDALL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government's Native Title Act has in place a framework for dealing with native title issues in a fair and equitable manner. Let me address that point that the shadow minister interjected on. The reality of native title was there for all of us once the Mabo decision was made by the High Court. The opposition knows only too well that it was the opposition that made the legislation much worse than it is. The shadow minister knows it and the mining industry knows it. I think it is one of those unfortunate things that happened in the heat of the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I move round the country and talk to the mining industry, it says that it accepts&mdash;as it has to, of course&mdash;that the legislation exists. As I understand, there is only one case under native title. So a lot of the concern is speculation as to what might happen. As the legislation settles in, all of those things will, in my view, come to a sensible conclusion. I do not want to go on for too long, otherwise the next opposition speaker will be cut off. </PARA>

Let me just finish with a few more examples, because I think it is important to give examples where major investment is taking place&mdash;all of them companies that the honourable member referred to. Western Mining is investing $800 million in an expanded smelting and mining capacity at Kalgoorlie, Kambalda and Leinster. There is a $330 million investment by CRA in the new iron ore mine at Marandoo in the Pilbara. Renison Goldfields is investing $53 million in a major new gold mine at Henty in Tasmania. The list goes on and on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to bore everyone, but I want to refer to one more example&mdash;I think this is a classic example of how our world-class mining deposits could be turned into world-class new industries&mdash;and that is the magnesite deposit in Queensland. The Queensland government and the Commonwealth government, through the CSIRO with Ian Howard Smith, the discoverer of the deposit, have worked together to make sure we get a new industry. The government is working to ensure that the Gladstone region in Queensland becomes basically the light metal capital of the world. I think the future for the mining industry is rosy. The mining industry is always filled with doomsayers, but I think they are getting to the position where native title is now out of the way and they are getting on with the job&mdash;a job that they do, in my opinion, extremely well. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has just indicated that the government is a master of rhetoric. There are not many things which this government does well, but one of them is to say one thing and do another. We all recall the promise of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) before the last election&mdash;the l-a-w one. This is just another example in the mining industry. This government consistently declares its support for industry and regional development, yet its policies rarely back this up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am proud to come from the electorate of Grey, where the great mine of Olympic Dam at Roxby Downs has been developed. It is the star in the crown of South Australian development over the last 20 or 30 years, but in many ways I think it has become the thorn in the side of Labor. It is a great mine. It is of world size, and it has a lot of new technology in it. I think it is world best practice in the development of a mine. Let us look at Labor's record on this development. Labor opposed it from day one. Labor was opposed to this great mine in South Australia, yet in the last year or two it has proudly come out and got headlines because it saw the value of it. So, after examination, Labor policy simply does not assist industry to develop and employ to its potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are here today to talk about sovereign risk, opportunistic government in the resources sector and its effect on the resources sector in Australia. Despite the government's rhetoric of support for industry, the level of sovereign risk which Australian companies must take into account when assessing future projects has increased. Australia used to be a country with low sovereign risk. However, under 11 years of an intrusive and divisive Labor government, the risks for investment have grown. Let us remember that we need to double investment to achieve that magical five per cent of unemployment by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's intrusive and reckless policies include, as the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) and the minister have mentioned, the native title legislation, the industrial relations legislation and world heritage legislation. They are all anti-employment. Through these pieces of legislation and others, this government has consistently undermined the certainty for the mining and resource industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go to some examples of the government's rhetoric. In last week's white paper on jobs, the government stated its commitment to encouraging industry in the regions and removing impediments. Page 174 of the white paper states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regions of Australia&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They need to become part of the modern Australia and global economy . . .</PARA>
<PARA>And the most important point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They need to make the most of their national resources.</PARA>
<PARA>In addition, page 159 of the white paper states that amongst the government's policies was `the removal of impediments to finance and investment for the regions'. I put it to the House that major government legislation has placed impediments in the way of finance and investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look again at the government's illogical three mines policy. My colleague the honourable member for Gippsland previously very accurately described the government's three mines policy as one of the great dinosaurs of public policy. This government's policy is clearly contrary to its white paper objective of helping regions make the most of their natural resources and find niches in mainstream markets abroad. This government is an obstacle to the optimum development of the minerals and energy sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the government's three mines is located, as I mentioned, at Olympic Dam in my electorate. Former Prime Minister Hawke showed integrity, consistency and courage in standing up for the three mines policy. There were many in his party who would have had no mines, but Hawke at least stood firm and made sure he gave Roxby Downs some opportunity to exist. I will come to the present Prime Minister and his attitude to Roxby Downs in a minute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, most talk about Olympic Dam is focused on its uranium mining when this is not its major role. Olympic Dam produces about 2 1/2 million tonnes of ore per year. Out of that, 70,000 tonnes per year becomes pure refined copper; 80 per cent of that copper is exported while 20 per cent is consumed on the east coast of Australia. Olympic Dam processes this through to the final product. It does not produce an interim product as, for example, does Mount Isa. Olympic Dam also produces 20,000 to 30,000 ounces of gold bullion per year. This is roughly equivalent to one house brick of gold per week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend Western Mining on its environmental role, particularly at the Olympic Dam mine. It has a proud record. It has a number of employees working and monitoring. I understand that the minister was there recently. I hope that he took the opportunity to look at the wonderful work it is doing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. I recommend it to anybody, particularly members of this House. As well as the gold, 500,000 ounces of silver bullion are produced each year. Only 30 per cent of Olympic Dam's profit comes from uranium; 60 per cent comes from copper and 10 per cent of the profit is made up from the gold and silver.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important thing to note about the magnificent operation at Olympic Dam&mdash;and I am glad to see the minister acknowledge it&mdash;is that the bulk of the smelter emissions are trapped and recycled. In 1982 the now Prime Minister could only preach doom and gloom about Roxby Downs. Taking a point of order at that time, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that it will be eight years before there is any employment whatsoever at Roxby Downs and that the unemployment in South Australia will need to be cleared in the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, these predictions turned out to be quite pessimistic, as South Australia reaped the employment benefits prior to this and unemployment got worse only under federal and state Labor governments of the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the native title legislation. During the native title debates last year, industry leaders warned us that mining would move increasingly offshore due to government created uncertainty. Ross Fardon called it a conflict between two just causes. He went on to say that it was beyond dispute that the impact of the Mabo decision on mining in Australia would be negative. He envisaged that Aborigines would be able to tie up exploration and development for long periods, which amounted to an effective veto on other interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are all familiar with the comments of John Prescott of BHP. I would like to refer to Marshall Perron, from the Northern Territory. Between 1971 and 1993, 67.5 per cent of applications for exploration licences on non-Aboriginal land were granted. In the same period, only 7.3 per cent of applications on Aboriginal lands were granted. For the record, for non-Aboriginal lands, 3,102 were applied for and 2,096 were accepted; for Aboriginal lands, 587 were applied for and 43 were acted upon. Mr Perron accepted that it was similar land area of equal prospectivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Perron also noted that `lost export markets are notoriously difficult to replace when commodity supplies from other countries have filled the gaps in demand'. He said, `Once there is a supplier elsewhere, it may never be profitable to open a new mine for a similar product in Australia.' Thus, while Labor dilly-dallies and equivocates on its mining and resource policies, our markets are being snapped up by other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I come to the heart of Labor's mistrust of individuals. Labor can never trust an individual. Labor can never trust the private sector. Labor can never encourage private enterprise. Labor can only ever be the servant of the union movement. Even this week we saw it within the white paper. Every time it wanted to make a key decision about the white paper, it was straight back to the ACTU, forever looking to control the Labor Party and forever looking to manipulate individuals by the power and the intimidation of the group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether it be in the parliament or in the union movement, and whether it be in the workplace or in the community, the time has come for the contribution of our great resources industries, who are the strength of our nation, and particularly the strength of regional Australia, to be recognised as the source of so much national wealth&mdash;much underestimated and underutilised by our urban dominant culture.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), raised the following matter of public importance:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of sovereign risk into the resources sector as a result of inconsistent and politically opportunistic Government policies influencing investment in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>There are two aspects of this matter to be discussed: firstly, those policies of the government over the last 10 or 11 years which have influenced investment and, secondly, the notion of sovereign risk. In the course of his contribution, the honourable member for Gippsland was at pains to point out the importance of the mining and resources sector, and in that part of his contribution he defeated his own case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point by referring to the publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia in the world</EMPHASIS>, produced by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and issued earlier this year. At page 45, under the heading `Mining and energy', the publication makes the following point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The resources sector generates around 8 per cent of Australia's GDP and $30 billion in exports (1992-93). The major industries in terms of gross value of production are oil and gas ($7.7 billion), coal ($6.9 billion), gold ($3.6 billion) and iron ore ($3.3 billion).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mining is the most export-oriented sector of the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is a major world supplier of many mining products, including coal, which earned $8.2 billion in 1991-92 and was Australia's biggest export commodity. Gold is another major export earner and has grown quickly since the beginning of the 1980s. Australia is now the third-largest gold producer in the world. Other significant exports include bauxite, diamonds, iron ore, lead, zinc, nickel and mineral sands.</PARA>
<PARA>Importantly, the following point is made:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mining exports grew strongly at an average annual rate of 11.3 per cent (current prices) between 1982 and 1992.</PARA>
<PARA>Why? As a direct result of the policies of this government. As part of the industry policy section of the white paper issued earlier this week, the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) released a paper entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Industry profiles</EMPHASIS>. Under the resources sector of that paper I refer to the heading `Prospects and the government approach'. That section of the papers released as part of the white paper makes the following point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the next five years, with a stronger international economy, real export earnings from the resource sector are forecast to increase by 20 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Asian region, where some 70 per cent of resource exports currently go, is expected to grow at twice the rate of the world as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA>The paper then goes on to discuss a whole range of government initiatives, starting with the floating of the dollar, tariff reform, labour market reform and a range of incentives for investment in the resources and other sectors. These initiatives include the 150 per cent tax concession for research and development, which was improved in the recent white paper; the development allowance; the general investment allowance; and other taxation arrangements, including depreciation, dividend imputation and the corporate tax rate of 33 per cent. I note the honourable member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) criticising us on this side for not supporting private enterprise. We reduced the corporate tax rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent at the same time as the honourable members for Gippsland and Grey were going around the country saying that the corporate tax rate should be jacked up from 39 per cent to 45 per cent, plus a 15 per cent GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move very quickly, given the limited time available, to the question of sovereign risk. I draw the attention of the House to the speech made by the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) at the AMIC conference on 5 May 1994. Near the conclusion of his speech, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At any one time about half of one per cent of Australia is under mining licences and about a twentieth of that is actually being mined. About 12 per cent is being explored and only a minor portion of that would be undergoing any sort of drilling program.</PARA>
<PARA>To find out what the actual facts are, let us have a look at some of the exploration which is occurring at the present time. I refer to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> dated 7 April. It makes the point about a record rise in mineral exploration in Victoria and then goes on to make the following point:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Western Australia recorded a 30 per cent increase in non-petroleum minerals exploration during the December quarter, with a gold boom in the state lifting expenditure in the period from $109.6 million to $119 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minerals exploration expenditure also rose strongly in Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania, while the Northern Territory remained unchanged at $18.9 million for the quarter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">National minerals exploration expenditure rose 11.9 per cent from $186.7 million to $208.9 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gold remained the largest source of minerals expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA>So much for the doom and gloom. So much for the lack of activity in the resource sector. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Commercial News</EMPHASIS> of 9 May, in an article headed `Exploration of mineral jumps in NT', the Northern Territory Minister for Mines and Energy stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Minerals exploration in the Northern Territory had jumped dramatically over the past 12 months . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That was on 9 May. All those things are a direct result of the policies which this government has implemented in the course of 11 years. I finish on the following point, given the very limited time available to me and the perspiring brows of the clerks. In respect of the pro resource industry amendments to the Mabo legislation which opposition members in the Senate voted down with the Greens and the Australian Democrats, Rick Farley in December last year stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I find it astonishing that the Liberal Party would sit down with the Democrats and the Greens and vote down amendments that are in fact supported by industry, their own constituency.</PARA>
<PARA>That was very aptly summarised in an editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> of 23 December 1993, where the editorial writers ask why the opposition did not support the pro-industry amendments. The editorial states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . by evading a principled response to a defining question of Australia's modern history, the Coalition has only publicised its weak leadership, its divisions, and its alienation from contemporary society.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">promote social justice; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">reduce the budget deficit, without increasing taxes. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a budget that seeks to consolidate and improve our economic performance whilst ensuring that all Australians share in the benefits of that progress. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, this is a highly distinctive budget. </PARA>
<PARA>It is the first budget in the history of the nation that has been introduced prior to the commencement of the financial year to which it relates. </PARA>
<PARA>This brings Australia into line with the major industrial countries and with normal private sector practice. </PARA>
<PARA>It is also the first budget which provides estimates of the budget outcome for the next four years. </PARA>
<PARA>This represents a new benchmark for budget reporting and government accountability. </PARA>
<PARA>The economic forecasts on which this Budget is built reflect the fact that we are now firmly in recovery and experiencing economic growth faster than almost any other industrial country. </PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, our economic fundamentals for continued growth are the best for 30 years. </PARA>
<PARA>This gives us the real prospect of maintaining strong economic and employment growth for the rest of the century. </PARA>
<PARA>This Budget also maintains, indeed accelerates, the Government's commitment to its deficit reduction program, which requires the deficit to be reduced to around one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA>Our forecast deficit for 1996-97 is now less than one per cent of GDP, and we expect the budget to be in surplus soon thereafter. </PARA>
<PARA>In achieving this outcome, we have not increased general taxation. </PARA>
<PARA>This Budget contains no new taxes and no increases in tax rates. </PARA>
<PARA>The only measures which add to revenue are those which improve tax compliance, or are directly related to cost recovery for government services. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia will remain one of the lowest taxed countries in the industrial world. </PARA>
<PARA>Nevertheless, this Budget maintains Labor's commitment to improve social justice in our society. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition to major initiatives to address the serious issue of long-term unemployment, announced last week in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation</EMPHASIS>, this Budget contains further measures to assist the disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA>This reflects Labor's determination not only to maximise growth of our economy, employment and real incomes, but to ensure as well that all sections of our society share in that increased prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Economic Context</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, in last year's Budget Speech, the then Treasurer stressed that the primary objective of that Budget was jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to be able to say tonight that the period of jobless growth that marked the first year and three-quarters of recovery from the recession is now well and truly behind us. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia is now experiencing strong employment growth with over 230,000 extra jobs since April last year. </PARA>
<PARA>Unemployment has fallen from a peak of just over 11 per cent to 10.3 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>And there is every reason to expect these favourable developments to continue.</PARA>
<PARA>Our economic settings are now highly conducive to growth. </PARA>
<PARA>Inflation remains at its lowest level for three decades and is less than that of our major trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA>Inflationary expectations are also low, which means we have excellent prospects for continuing to be a low inflation nation. </PARA>
<PARA>Interest rates on bank lending are at their lowest levels since the 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA>Business confidence is high. </PARA>
<PARA>In manufacturing industry it is at the highest level for 30 years. </PARA>
<PARA>Consumer confidence is at its highest level for ten years, and is near record levels. </PARA>
<PARA>Wages are increasingly being determined on an enterprise basis and with regard to productivity improvement. </PARA>
<PARA>Productivity is increasing markedly and in some cases quite spectacularly. </PARA>
<PARA>Real unit labour costs are declining. </PARA>
<PARA>Profit share is near its all time high. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia's international competitiveness continues to improve and is now 30 per cent greater than it was a decade ago. </PARA>
<PARA>Time lost in industrial disputes in 1993 was the lowest level for 30 years. </PARA>
<PARA>In short, the widespread program of microeconomic reform instituted by this Government over the last decade has transformed the Australian economy so that it is now much more competitive, efficient and export oriented. </PARA>
<PARA>Rather than relying on our good fortune to be a relatively small nation with vast natural resources, the so-called "lucky country" syndrome, we are now demonstrating to the world that we are determined to work hard and intelligently to maximise our economic welfare. </PARA>
<PARA>We can now see the results beginning to come through. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia's economic growth of 4 per cent in 1993 was far better than most industrial countries which collectively grew by just over one per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>Many of them, including such major economies as Germany, France and Italy, suffered economic contraction, and our single largest trading partner, Japan, had virtually no growth. </PARA>
<PARA>Our employment growth of 3 per cent over the last year is also high. </PARA>
<PARA>For the industrial countries as a whole, employment growth in 1993 was zero. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian manufacturing industry increased its production by 9 per cent in 1993, the largest increase for two decades. </PARA>
<PARA>And our export performance in recent years has been nothing less than outstanding. </PARA>
<PARA>The volume of manufacturing exports grew by 15 per cent in 1993, and has grown by an average of 13 per cent a year since the mid-80s. </PARA>
<PARA>Similarly exports of services grew by 11 per cent last year and have increased by 9 per cent per annum since the mid-80s. </PARA>
<PARA>As a consequence of these developments, commodities now represent around 65 per cent of our total volume of exports, compared to almost 80 per cent a decade ago. </PARA>
<PARA>With commodity prices now being at very low levels, that diversification of our exports is standing us in very good stead. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact that our exporters have done so well is due to Australia's improved competitiveness, and two further major factors. </PARA>
<PARA>First, the fast growing countries of East Asia (excluding Japan) have become increasingly important markets. </PARA>
<PARA>These countries have been growing at twice the pace of our major trading partners as a whole since 1990-91, and now account for 33 per cent of our merchandise exports compared to only 19 per cent ten years ago. </PARA>
<PARA>And second&mdash;less tangible but no less important&mdash;is the attitudinal change among Australian firms&mdash;an increasingly outward orientation, which recognises the enormous potential benefits of selling into world markets, particularly in the fast growing Asian region. </PARA>
<PARA>This attitudinal change reflects, in part, the benefit of this Government's policy to open up markets to competition, especially through reduced protection, and its success in developing trade relations in the Asian region.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Economic Prospects</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, with these very substantial improvements to our economic structure, Australians can look forward to the future with considerable confidence. </PARA>
<PARA>Our immediate prospects are for even faster growth. </PARA>
<PARA>Real GDP is forecast to grow by 4 1/2 per cent in 1994-95, compared to 4 per cent in 1993-94. </PARA>
<PARA>Employment is expected to increase by 3 per cent, or almost another quarter of a million jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>The unemployment rate is forecast to fall to around 9 1/2 per cent by June 1995. </PARA>
<PARA>Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index is forecast to remain low next year at 2 1/4 per cent, or about the level of our major trading partners.</PARA>
<PARA>Real wages and real household disposable income continued to grow in 1993-94 and are forecast to grow more strongly in 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA>Crucial to the achievement of these outcomes will be a substantial upturn in business investment. </PARA>
<PARA>So far, business investment has made little contribution to economic recovery, but this is expected to change quite markedly in the coming year. </PARA>
<PARA>Continued strong economic growth, near record high profit levels, high business confidence, low interest rates and inflation, sharply rising capacity utilisation, and the completion of the process of corporate balance sheet repair following the excesses of the 1980s, are all conducive factors for increased business investment. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, this Government has created a very favourable tax regime for business over recent years. </PARA>
<PARA>This includes the provision of accelerated depreciation allowances, a development allowance for large projects, the general investment allowance, a 150 per cent write-off for research and development expenditure, and reduction of company tax to an internationally competitive rate of 33 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>These tax incentives will reduce the Government's tax revenue for 1994-95 by around $3 billion&mdash;a substantial benefit to business which will grow in later years. </PARA>
<PARA>All this represents a powerful set of inducements for increased business investment which is forecast to grow by 14 1/2 per cent in 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA>While import growth will pick up next year as business investment increases, the current account deficit should increase only slightly. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia's export performance should remain robust over the next year, with strong growth in exports of elaborately transformed manufactures and of services continuing from recent years. </PARA>
<PARA>The terms of trade is forecast to lift for the first time since 1988-89, although only slightly, due to the gradual improvement in the world economy. </PARA>
<PARA>Economic activity in the major industrial countries is forecast to increase to around 2 1/2 per cent in 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA>That is clearly a bull point for our economy. </PARA>
<PARA>The much faster growth rates of the dynamic economies of our region mean our major trading partners' growth will be 3 3/4 per cent, up half a percent on 1993-94. </PARA>
<PARA>That overall improvement in world economic growth will help to sustain the higher level of economic growth now evident in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA>Sustained growth through the decade will also require the maintenance of a low rate of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>Monetary policy over the medium term will be directed to keeping inflation and inflationary expectations at low levels. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Budget Strategy</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, the Government said during the election campaign that its election commitments would be delivered in the context of a declining budget deficit. </PARA>
<PARA>This it will do. </PARA>
<PARA>In last year's Budget the Government set out a budget deficit reduction strategy geared to securing a deficit of around one per cent of GDP in 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA>When an economy is in recession, it is entirely appropriate that budgetary policy be deployed to support the economy and the community. </PARA>
<PARA>That involves a rising deficit. </PARA>
<PARA>But as the pace of economic growth quickens, and recovery starts to become self-sustaining, it is important that budgetary support to domestic demand be pared back. </PARA>
<PARA>By winding back the deficit, the public sector reduces its call on national saving. </PARA>
<PARA>This increases our capacity to finance further private sector investment without the need for greater recourse to other nations' savings through increased overseas borrowings and foreign equity investment in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government fully recognises this and has implemented one of the most rigorous fiscal consolidation programs of all industrial countries. </PARA>
<PARA>Details are contained in the Budget Papers. </PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, the outcomes contained in this Budget are for lower deficits as a percentage of GDP than those forecast last year. </PARA>
<PARA>Those lower deficits will ensure that Australia's government debt, as a proportion of GDP, remains among the lowest for industrial countries. </PARA>
<PARA>Last year the Government legislated major steps to implement its deficit reduction strategy, and ensure that the 1996-97 outcome would accord with its commitment. </PARA>
<PARA>This involved a package of measures which improved the projected outcome for 1996-97 by almost 1 3/4 per cent of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA>Included amongst those measures was postponement of the second leg of the foreshadowed tax cuts worth over $3 1/2 billion. </PARA>
<PARA>This year we have again constrained all but the highest priority expenditure measures. </PARA>
<PARA>In light of this action, and the Government's capacity to improve its fiscal consolidation program without further tax increases, we have decided not to introduce a jobs levy as proposed in last December's Green Paper as a means of paying for the initiatives in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA>Such a levy would have substantially counteracted the tax cuts brought in only last November. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, I now turn to the Budget outcome and forecasts. </PARA>
<PARA>The budget deficit for the current financial year, 1993-94, is now expected to be $13.6 billion&mdash;$2.4 billion lower than forecast at budget time last year. </PARA>
<PARA>The budget deficit for 1994-95 will be $11.7 billion. </PARA>
<PARA>The deficit will therefore fall from an expected 3.2 per cent of GDP this year to 2.5 per cent next year. </PARA>
<PARA>This clearly meets the requirement set by this Government in its Fiscal Framework for a credible decline in the deficit towards the objective of around one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA>And the budget deficit for 1996-97 is now projected to be 0.9 per cent of GDP, or 0.3 of a percentage point lower than projected after last year's Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>By 1997-98 the budget will be approaching balance. </PARA>
<PARA>The major initiatives announced in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation</EMPHASIS> mean there has been little room for other new spending while maintaining the deficit reduction program. </PARA>
<PARA>Nevertheless, over half a billion dollars of new spending in 1994-95 is contained in tonight's Budget, but it is more than offset by other measures announced tonight. </PARA>
<PARA>There will therefore be no expenditure blowout. </PARA>
<PARA>Outlays as a percentage of GDP are forecast to fall from 26.6 this year to 26.2 in 1994-95 and to fall by a further two percentage points over the subsequent three years. </PARA>
<PARA>Although the only revenue enhancements in this Budget relate to improved tax compliance and cost recovery in government services, total revenue will increase slightly as a percentage of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA>That is due to the impact of economic recovery&mdash;especially increased employment&mdash;and measures introduced in last year's Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>Revenue growth will however be slower than in previous recoveries due to low inflation, continuing tariff reductions, reduced dividends from government enterprises, and reductions in interest receipts resulting from the repayment of State debt. </PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly, revenue as a share of GDP will remain well below the levels of the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Measures in the Budget</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, I now move on to the main measures contained in this Budget&mdash;full details are provided in supporting documents. </PARA>
<PARA>Tonight's Budget reaffirms this Government's commitment to social justice. </PARA>
<PARA>Last week in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation</EMPHASIS> the Prime Minister announced a range of new policies and programs costing $6.5 billion over the next four years. </PARA>
<PARA>These programs are primarily aimed at reducing unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>The key initiative in the package&mdash;the Job Compact&mdash;will help long-term unemployed people to get the skills and experience they need to get back into jobs. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation</EMPHASIS> includes extensive reforms to labour market assistance, including case management and improvements to the delivery of labour market programs. </PARA>
<PARA>The social security system will be restructured to reflect changes in our society and to remove disincentives to work. </PARA>
<PARA>A Parenting Allowance will be introduced for eligible unemployed people and low-income earners. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation</EMPHASIS> also includes training and education reforms. </PARA>
<PARA>Entry-level training places will be increased and a new Youth Training Allowance will be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA>The package also includes a regional development strategy, important microeconomic reforms and an industry policy aimed at improving enterprise competitiveness and developing international markets for Australian goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, this Government has a firm commitment to improving the position of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. </PARA>
<PARA>Tonight's Budget commits almost $1 1/2 billion dollars over the next ten years to build up a self-sustaining National Land Fund. </PARA>
<PARA>The Land Fund is a major element of the Government's response to the Mabo decision. </PARA>
<PARA>It recognises that many indigenous people have been dispossessed of their land and will not directly benefit from Native Title Legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>But besides land, the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples remains of continuing concern to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The standard of health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples is still well below that of other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>Current health services, across all levels of government, are not meeting their needs. </PARA>
<PARA>To redress this situation, a further $500 million will be provided over five years to expand and extend Aboriginal health programs. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, a number of other significant health measures are included in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>To accelerate the process of mental health reform and to address areas of concern identified by the Report of the National Inquiry into the Human Rights of People with Mental Illness, $169 million will be spent over four years. </PARA>
<PARA>This builds on funds already provided through the National Mental Health Strategy. </PARA>
<PARA>These new funds also support the continuation of vocational rehabilitation services for people with a psychiatric disability. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, the Government is very concerned about the tragic loss and trauma to Australian women occasioned by breast cancer. </PARA>
<PARA>To improve our understanding and treatment of their problem, the Government is providing $209 million over four years in funding for a National Breast Cancer Program. </PARA>
<PARA>This includes $187 million for the continuation and expansion of the national screening program, and $22 million for a national breast cancer centre and a breast cancer fundraising foundation. </PARA>
<PARA>As a step towards the Prime Minister's election commitment of lifting health and medical research funding to two per cent of total health expenditure by the year 2000, an additional $93 million is being made available for such research over the next four years. </PARA>
<PARA>Increased funding for breast cancer research projects is expected to result, with decisions being based firmly on the quality of research applications. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, vaccine-preventable diseases in children have been rising. </PARA>
<PARA>This, in a wealthy nation, is simply not acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA>To address this, an additional $9 1/2 million will be spent in 1994-95 on promoting childhood immunisation. </PARA>
<PARA>In aggregate this Budget allocates almost one billion dollars over four years for new and expanded health programs&mdash;without increasing the Medicare levy. </PARA>
<PARA>A package of measures worth $62.7 million over four years will assist homeless people through the enhancement of accommodation assistance, the extension of rent assistance to young homeless students and improved community support services. </PARA>
<PARA>Our aim in extending rent assistance to young homeless students on the Austudy Student Homeless Rate is to encourage them to stay in education or training. </PARA>
<PARA>After aligning the Personal Income Test for these students with that for the Youth Training Allowance, the net cost of this assistance will be $37.5 million over four years. </PARA>
<PARA>Following the $2000 rise in the Austudy Supplementary Loan Scheme limit announced last year, the limit will be further increased from $6000 to $7000 from 1995. </PARA>
<PARA>Access to justice will be enhanced by a number of measures, including expanded community and Family Court mediation services, and increased funding for legal aid and disability discrimination programs. </PARA>
<PARA>A number of new and specially-tailored programs for Veterans are contained in the 1994-95 Budget, addressing the needs of younger and older veterans and including initiatives which will be welcomed by war widows and widowers, and merchant mariners. </PARA>
<PARA>Younger veterans will benefit from a greater focus on rehabilitation, early intervention and health promotion programs as well as assistance for those with psychiatric difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA>The Budget also contains measures which respond to concerns raised over recent years about inconsistencies in the determination of disability pension claims.</PARA>
<PARA>Maintaining our strong commitment to the environment, the Commonwealth is offering to fund a Daintree Rescue Package on a joint basis with the Queensland Government. </PARA>
<PARA>This will ensure protection of this unique area. </PARA>
<PARA>The Sydney 2000 Olympics will be a tremendous event for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>To support Australia's athletes in these historic games, the Government will provide $135 million over the next six years for athlete preparation. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, Australia's Development Co-operation program is an important means of promoting sustainable economic and social advancement in developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA>By improving the standard of living of people in these countries, Australia is helping give those worse off than ourselves a fair go. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is providing an additional $68.4 million to the Development Co-operation program in 1994-95, primarily for initiatives in the Asia-Pacific region, including Indochina. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a significant real increase in aid funding, continuing the trend set in 1990-91, and keeps Australia's aid contribution above the average for industrial countries. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will fund a national Asian languages and studies program for Australian schools at a net cost of $48 million over the next four years. </PARA>
<PARA>This will improve language and cultural skills and provide a solid platform for strengthening our cultural and business links with Asia well into the next century. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, a number of savings measures are also contained in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>The Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) will be aligned with income tax arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>Repayments will now reflect the proportion of the year during which those with HECS obligations earn above the repayments threshold. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has also decided on a further program of asset sales. </PARA>
<PARA>As announced in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation</EMPHASIS>, it is the Government's view that airports now owned by the Federal Airports Corporation would perform better for the community if they were privately owned. </PARA>
<PARA>Towards this end, to promote competition and allow clear comparisons of performance between airports, the Government will work through a process to prepare these airports for sale. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has also announced its intention to sell its full equity in the Australian Industry Development Corporation Limited. </PARA>
<PARA>While there are no general taxation increases in this Budget, there are some measures to improve tax compliance. </PARA>
<PARA>The ATO has identified a range of areas under existing laws where compliance can be improved&mdash;either directly through better procedures for the collection of outstanding taxes, or indirectly through measures which can be expected to boost voluntary compliance. </PARA>
<PARA>Some of these areas have been the subject of recommendations by the Parliamentary Joint Committee of Public Accounts and the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA>This measure is expected to increase tax revenues by $300 million in 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA>There are also measures to improve cost recovery for government services. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Securities Commission fee structure will be simplified and rationalised. </PARA>
<PARA>This will ensure that more of the costs of company regulation are borne by the companies and market participants who benefit, rather than taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA>These changes will generate about $40 million a year and restore the fees in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA>From 1 January 1995 the departure tax will be replaced by a $27 charge for international passengers to recover the cost of customs, immigration and quarantine services and short-term visa processing. </PARA>
<PARA>In the 1992-93 Budget the Government announced the phased introduction of full recovery of the costs incurred in implementing aviation safety standards and 50 per cent of the costs of safety standards setting and compliance services. </PARA>
<PARA>As a further step in this process, this Budget increases cost recovery by $25.3 million, via an increase in the excise on avgas and avtur, and a special charge on Australian international operators. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is also announcing several taxation initiatives in this Budget.</PARA>
<PARA>Following the review announced in last year's Budget of the operation of Employee Share Acquisition Schemes, the Government will substantially improve incentives for schemes that will best foster workplace productivity growth and encourage employees to take an ownership stake in their company. </PARA>
<PARA>At the same time it will institute measures to prevent Employee Share Acquisition Schemes being misused. </PARA>
<PARA>From tonight, employees participating in schemes that offer shares in their employer's company will be able either to receive $500 per year in the form of tax exempt discounts on shares, or to defer tax for up to ten years on up to $1500 worth of shares. </PARA>
<PARA>In both cases, the shares must be held for at least five years. </PARA>
<PARA>And the schemes will be subject to a range of conditions to ensure they are equitable to all employees and encourage improvements in workplace productivity. </PARA>
<PARA>I will be releasing further details of the arrangements tonight. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will be undertaking a review of Fringe Benefits Tax compliance costs, in light of concerns that have been expressed about the costs borne by business in complying with the FBT. </PARA>
<PARA>The aim of the review will be to minimise FBT compliance costs whilst protecting the tax base. </PARA>
<PARA>I will announce details of the review shortly. </PARA>
<PARA>Excise on fuel oil, heating oil and kerosene will be reduced by almost two cents per litre from tonight. </PARA>
<PARA>The reduction in fuel oil excise will provide significant benefits to coastal shipping and export-oriented minerals projects. </PARA>
<PARA>The superannuation matters outstanding from the FitzGerald Report, and the protection of small amounts, will be addressed in a separate statement I shall make during this Budget session. </PARA>
<PARA>We are currently undertaking extensive consultations with the superannuation industry and other interested parties. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Concluding Comments</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, the major policy challenge facing Australia is to achieve strong sustainable growth during the 1990s, in order to reduce unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government believes that an unemployment rate of 5 per cent should be within our grasp by the turn of the century, and that even lower levels of unemployment are possible in subsequent years. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia has probably never been better placed to achieve a prolonged period of high economic and employment growth. </PARA>
<PARA>In our first seven years in Office&mdash;from 1983 to 1990&mdash;we increased employment by 1.7 million. </PARA>
<PARA>Emulating this performance should be within our capabilities between now and the end of the decade. </PARA>

<PARA>This bill seeks appropriations of the consolidated revenue fund in 1994-95 totalling $5,013.8 million. Appropriation Bill (No. 2) provides for proposed expenditure on the construction of public works and buildings, the acquisition of sites and buildings, certain advances and loans, items of plant and equipment, which are clearly definable as capital in nature, and expenditure on new policy initiatives for which legislation has not been previously approved.

<PARA>Finance a question without notice concerning bank interest rates charged to rural customers. The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is possible that the cases to which the honourable Member refers in his Question relate to customers who took out medium term fixed interest rate loans in 1989, prior to the period of subtantial falls in interest rates which began in 1990. At that time, rates on fixed interest rate loans were typically lower than those on variable rate loans; interest rates on overdrafts, for example, were generally over 20 per cent at that time. Those borrowers locked themselves into the high interest rates then prevailing which they have to pay until the term of the loan or loans expires. Borrowers can usually renegotiate these loans before their expiry, but, because banks in most cases have locked themselves into funding for the term of the loans (and at the high rates prevailing when the loan was made), they will require compensation through some form of early repayment penalty on the borrower.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This kind of risk confronts any borrower who chooses a fixed-rate term loan rather than a variable rate loan. The rate may be lower than that payable on a variable-rate loan at the time it is taken out; it cannot be raised further if market rates rise but nor can it fall if market rates fall (as they have over the past four years).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's program of banking deregulation has resulted in a rapid expansion in the availability of credit, enhanced competition from foreign banks, and the development of new financing techniques and products. As a result the banking sector is now more competitive and efficient without any compromise of prudential standards. Australia's banks are now more responsive to the borrowing needs of customers: the availability of finance has increased (although customers must now pay a market rate) and financial products are more varied and flexible and can be tailored to meet specific borrower requirements.</PARA>
