<PARA>There is no more important role that this House has than to hold ministers to account for their conduct as ministers of the Crown and in their administration of the affairs of the Australian people. There is no worse thing that a minister can do than to mislead this parliament in relation to the conduct and the administration of the affairs of a minister. There is no clearer case than that which has been established in this House yesterday&mdash;that there is a minister who has misled the parliament and misled the Australian people, a minister who deserves the complete censure of this House for the conduct of her affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is urgently necessary that standing orders be suspended at the first available opportunity this morning so that this House can deliberate upon the things that it has been told: where it has been proven that that minister has not been candid; where it has been proven that this minister has misled this House, not once but on three occasions; and where it is clear that this is a minister who, over a period of three months in this place, has sought to concoct a gigantic tale as to the administration of her affairs and the administration of the sports rorts program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely clear that, in relation to that concocted tale, every piece of evidence which comes to light damns the minister further. Every piece of information&mdash;that turns up in a documentary form, that turns up in an answer to a question, that turns up from the sporting groups that have been affected, that turns up from the Auditor-General, that turns up from the involvement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), that turns up from the involvement of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and that turns up from the involvement of the honourable member for Jagajaga (Mr Staples)&mdash;damns this minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It gives the lie to the explanation that she has sought to maintain in this House that this is somehow a political program or a program of expenditure that was only ever considered on a needs basis and money was only ever granted where eligible applications were taken into account and where they were justified on a needs basis. That whole story has been a concoction. Sure, it has had its lighter moments like the great big whiteboard, but now it is a matter of the utmost seriousness. This is a minister who has been caught out and this is a minister who must go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This minister has been trying to maintain in this House that she granted only eligible grants. She said to a parliamentary committee that the department, through its system, threw out all those that were ineligible. She said, `I never saw them'. Yet we had the spectre in this House yesterday of the minister, when making an additional response to a question in this House, freely admitting that the Pine Rivers youth band was not on the schedule and that it was not considered an eligible grant, but that it was granted on the basis of representation from none other than the Attorney-General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister took an ineligible applications considered it eligible and gave it money. The Attorney-General needed to prop up his chances in a by-election. The minister claimed she had never seen this ineligible application, yet she picked it out on the basis of the representation of the Attorney-General and she granted it. She has clearly misled the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts and she has clearly misled this parliament. She is a minister that deserves censure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She is also a minister that is completely at odds with her own Prime Minister, for she has completely dumped the Prime Minister into this whole affair. She had him, on her say-so, saying this as recently as Monday, 21 February 1994:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those opposite may laugh, but all her proposals were eligible ones.</PARA>
<PARA>It took one day for the minister to come in here, as she did yesterday, and to nominate the Pine Rivers youth band as an ineligible grant which she granted. She put herself at odds with her Prime Minister. She has now put the Prime Minister in a position where he has misled this parliament because he said that only eligible grants were given. On her own admission yesterday, the minister gave an ineligible grant, one that she was never supposed to see, on the say-so of the Attorney-General, and she granted money out of the taxpayers' funds for blatant political advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the only time she has misled this parliament. She has repeatedly misled this parliament. On 15 December 1993, she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decisions were made by me as the minister because I have responsibility as portfolio minister . . .</PARA>
<PARA>We now know that was false. We know that the minister did not make the decision which had the effect of giving money to the Altone Park complex out of the sports rorts funds. In this parliament yesterday, she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister was involved in the government's decision to fund $1 million as a specific election commitment towards the funding of the Altone Park complex. What I then said was that I had responsibility for how that could be and should be done.</PARA>
<PARA>She did not make the decision, contrary to what she told this House on 15 December 1993: `The decisions were made by me as the minister'. An ex-staffer of the Prime Minister was fighting an election for the marginal Labor seat of Perth, which he was worried he would not win. So he went out and made a commitment to the Altone Park complex. The Prime Minister told the minister to go and put that into effect. She had nothing to do with that decision. She freely admitted that yesterday. She was just told to go and find the money from her sports rorts fund, and she found $250,000 for the 1993-94 year when there was no program for the 1993-94 year and when there was no budget appropriation for it. She entered into a commitment on the say-so of the Prime Minister without an appropriation for future funding. How can you say the Prime Minister was not involved? She dobbed him right in yesterday and said that he was involved in that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was not the only time she misled the parliament. It was absolutely clear that last year she misled the parliament. Last year she was maintaining that she had given every document to the Auditor-General, yet we had a document which the Auditor-General quite candidly said was never given to him. A fax was sent to the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) from the minister's office, classifying his seat as safe Labor and asking him which projects he would like funded in his electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has never answered. She has never given an explanation as to what the purpose of that fax was, never given an explanation as to how it came into effect, never given an explanation as to why the Auditor-General never saw it and never given an explanation as to how she was able to stand up and say candidly in this House that she had given every document to the Auditor-General when we proved conclusively that that was false and that, in saying it, she has misled this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Misleading the parliament is a case where a minister should be sacked. The 1976 report of the royal commission on Australian government administration stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In cases where the minister has misled parliament, condoned or authorised a blatantly unreasonable use of executive power or more vaguely where the minister's behaviour contravenes established standards of morality, resignation or dismissal is the appropriate action.</PARA>
<PARA>The appropriate action, according to the doctrines of the Westminster parliamentary system, is for this minister to resign. If she will not resign, the appropriate action is for the Prime Minister to dismiss her. An article in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a growing view in Labor ranks that the only way of cutting the Government free from the sports rorts tangle is to cut Mrs Kelly free of the sports portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the only way that you will disentangle yourselves from this matter. If you do not have the decency to assert proper standards because it is warranted by the Westminster system and the doctrine of accountability, you could at least have the decency to try to save yourselves from the odium and the contempt of a public who now sees the Prime Minister as someone who cannot maintain standards, who cannot hold accountability to the public, and who has grown imperial and arrogant in office. In respect of public accountability and administration he needs to send this minister off to the back bench where she should have been and where she should now be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion. Yesterday was a classic example of the fact that this government has totally abused the whole parliamentary process. It got caught out and it will now pay the penalty for it. Let us go back to the question of eligibility. We will look at a minute from Ms Dal Bon. Do honourable members remember Ms Dal Bon? She was the person who really damned this government and the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly). Let us have a look at what she said about validating program eligibility:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Applications not meeting program eligibility are generally weeded out by the Department on receipt. However, with the compression of the timetables this is not always the case and I am advised that sometimes projects not meeting program guidelines are included in schedules submitted to the Minister's Office, albeit on schedule three.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the current round I insisted that all such applications be removed from the schedule and I recommend this practice be adopted in the future.</PARA>
<PARA>What did the minister say about that? Did she say, `Yes, I took Ms Dal Bon's advice?'. No, she did not. She said that Ms Dal Bon was doing what she told her to do. Not only has the minister taken credit for this eligibility question; she has also specifically said that Ms Dal Bon has no right to take the credit for it. Yesterday we saw a classic indication of the fact that she has misled this House, probably in the most obscene way that most members, including those who have been here for many years, like the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), have ever seen. She quite blatantly misled the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sad fact is that yesterday you sat there on the back bench and you knew exactly what was happening. You knew that she was dragging you down to levels that you did not think were possible. She has totally implicated the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the front bench and yourselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If honourable members are going to look at what is required in this, I will take them to the Western Australian royal commission. This is now starting to smack of WA Inc. Do you know what Brian Burke did in WA Inc.? He just happened to use public funds via sporting clubs for the distribution of his dirt bag. The commission established to review public sector finances said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apart from the obvious point that funds at the disposal of the Minister, or available for payment at ministerial direction, can be perceived to be open to political preferment, the practice is contrary to the basic principle of parliamentary control of the annual disbursement of funds through appropriations made by law . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The essential point is that the budget provides for, and Parliament approves, annual appropriations for departments such as the arts, and sport and recreation within the context of overall budget constraints and priorities. It is possible for bodies that benefit from these appropriations to then be able to double and triple dip into the public purse through grants from the Health Promotion Foundation or through ministerial grants . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission considers that the allocation of revenue by law to ministers and statutory authorities for disbursement at their discretion is an undesirable practice that can be perceived to be open to abuse.</PARA>
<PARA>Not only can it be perceived to be open to abuse but it has been very openly abused. When that minister came in here yesterday she knew that she had taken that Pine Rivers grant outside the guidelines&mdash;the guidelines over which she had attacked Ms Dal Bon for taking the credit for changing them. She must go because she deliberately misled this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The gall of this government to attack the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) the day before in relation to his comments is another example of the fact that the government will go to quite extraordinary lengths to justify its own dirt. This is dirt&mdash;this is dirty. The practice of this minister in relation to this program was sanctioned on high, as evidenced again by Ms Dal Bon, who was told when she came into this department that `we did these things as sanctioned on high'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who was on high?  Was it the minister? Was it the Prime Minister? Why is it that every major newspaper in this country has called for the resignation or the sacking of this minister? Why will she not go? Because the Prime Minister is up to his ears in this whole dirty, smelly rort. You know that he is and the rest of the country knows that he is. She misled the House and she should either resign or she should be sacked. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government will not facilitate this motion, although we understand absolutely the background to the opposition's moving of it. It is the hope of the mover of this motion, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), that he is going to surf into the Liberal Party leadership on the back of it. As he gets lazier and lazier, as he handles the issue and makes more and more mistakes in his actual presentation in the chamber, his ultimate motive gets more and more obvious. He is caught in this place in a conflict of disloyalties. The conflict is not with any particular leadership; it is which leader he wants to knock off. Which leader does he want to knock off?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I raise a very simple point of order. This is a motion to suspend standing orders. The Leader of the House has been on his feet for a minute and a half and he is nowhere remotely close to the substance of the motion, and he knows it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order!  The honourable member for Bennelong will resume his seat. There is no point of order. In the course of the presentation of the two previous speakers, the issue was quite widely canvassed and the Leader of the House is in order.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You set the standards in this. You broadened the debate in your moving of this motion. We accepted it. Now we will answer it, thanks very much, without interruption. As I said, he is caught in a conflict of disloyalty. He has Michael Kroger parading on television endorsing Bronwyn Bishop in the certain knowledge that, through that process of endorsing Bronwyn Bishop, he is putting the skids under the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He hopes that in the morass he will come forward as the alternative leader of the Liberal Party. If he gets enough destabilisation going, gets the old Kroger he lunches with regularly to plot the destabilisation of his leader, he will then see what happens down the line&mdash;`After all, I can make my reputation on this matter so I will keep my name up there in lights after I have successfully white-anted him'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the honourable member for Higgins also has another strategy because he does not know whether that is enough. He does not know whether he really wants to knock his leader off at this stage. He thinks that perhaps he will have a go at the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge). So what does he do? He has his factotum parading around the place using information, which he produced inside the Liberal Party, to write letters to the press, undermining the&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, on a point of order: no matter how much latitude may have been extended to the honourable member for Higgins and the honourable member for Ballarat, at least what they had to say related to the minister on the rack. At least what they had to say was relevant to the issue. The minister now speaking has not even come within a hundred miles of the substance of the motion and you should bring him back to the motion and rule him out of order.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those opposite have their factotum running around the country, white-anting their deputy leader, revealing the internal balance of the Liberal Party to do it. We do not facilitate life for people who wish to betray their leaders. We will oblige them to skate through on their own merits and not off the back of their illegitimate claims here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me start to deal with the issues that the honourable member for Higgins raised. Do opposition members want to hear that? For starters he raised the subject of the Pine River band. He told us that this was a get-up by the Prime Minister to support the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), who was then selected as Attorney-General pro tem, to assist his by-election campaign. Is that correct? That is what the honourable member said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The band's application was received on 1 September 1992, two days before the closing date for applications. The department advised the applicants in writing on 4 September that at that stage they were ineligible. They then wrote back virtually straightaway to appeal against this decision. On 13 January the grant was awarded. I do not know whether the honourable member for Higgins recollects the timetable of the time, but that was well in advance of any particular by-election even being considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is how he is getting away with this&mdash;`slip sliding' away. He has stopped actually thinking about this issue. He stopped actually any detailed consideration of the matters before him. Any requirement upon him to be accurate is no longer a matter of interest to him because, fundamentally, he is intellectually lazy. Fundamentally, he has only one target and it does not happen to be Minister Kelly. She happens to be merely a way station target on the way through to his leader, or at least to his deputy leader&mdash;whatever particular instance he considers fit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For starters, the honourable member for Higgins misled the House with dates that were readily available to him when he got up and determined that this had been cynically introduced in a by-election context, to amplify the point he sought to make that somehow or other this was a deal aimed at assisting a person who was in the process of going through an election. That is the first bit of nonsense from him. Quite emphatically he was wrong in his allegation that this was put up by the Attorney-General to get him through. He advocated it in exactly the same way as members on this side of the House and members on that side of the House, including the Leader of the Opposition, advocated the claims of various elements within the group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we go to the suggestion put forward in relation to Altone Park that somehow or other this was connected to this activity in a way to discredit the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister made a statement during the election campaign that he would fund to the tune of $1 million&mdash;$750,000 of it directly off the budget and $250,000 out of this program&mdash;a $7 million project that is well supported by local authorities and by the state government in Western Australia, a very substantial project. This was a statement during the election campaign as an election undertaking, albeit in the seat of Perth. Fine. There is no walking back from that. But what I resent in that particular process is the suggestion that somehow those opposite regard this as a reason the minister ought to resign. If they regard that as a reason the minister ought to resign, perhaps they could explain to us the difference, in anything other than scale&mdash;the difference in scale is massive, of course&mdash;between that particular election undertaking and the undertaking of the Leader of the Opposition in Cairns during the election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the particular difference? The particular difference is, of course, $29,250,000. You make a claim that there are inappropriate administrative processes of proceeding here. What administrative processes proceeded in that particular problem? Was it a consideration undertaken by the Higher Education Council? Was it passed through the higher education budget processes of the department and given consideration in regard to priorities: Cairns versus other alternatives around the place? Was that a consideration of influence due? Was it a consideration based on what was available to you when you were ostensibly cutting public expenditure that you would do that $30 million? Did you contemplate that you might have to, say, remove money from Sydney University or the University of Western Australia or whatever to pay for it? `No. I calculated in my head three times 10, as I made it, and that came to $30 million, boys. I worked it out and it came to three times 10. Then I went up to Cairns and I said, in virtually the same interview, "Yes, we've got a great Liberal candidate up here; he is going to win that election. I am here supporting him, and here is a bag of money, 30 million bucks on the knocker&mdash;no research, nothing. You vote for us, you get it"'. You have the hide to walk into this place and offer a criticism of the minister, offer a criticism of the Prime Minister, with filthy hands like that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not take any notice of honourable members who get up and talk about the Western Australian royal commission. That commission declared the Western Australian parliament corrupt; the structure of the Western Australian parliament, it says, is corrupt.

It is anticipated that construction will commence mid-year and continue until mid-1996. As at October 1993, the estimated cost for this proposal was $48.9 million.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition, naturally, supports the motion moved by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Sciacca). This arises from a decision taken by previous governments to considerably increase the capacity of the Garden Island defence facility.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important element is of course the demonstration in technical terms of the reality of a two-ocean naval concept. This was a concept which was developed back in the 1970s. For a long time Australia tended to take the view that its navy had to be based on the east coast and was part of a British Commonwealth naval presence in the South-East Asian and Pacific region. What has been significant about the change in address in the last few years is the acceptance of the fact that Australia is a continent surrounded principally by two oceans; namely, the Pacific and the Indian oceans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significance of the decision to build up the Garden Island facility was the recognition that we had to maintain on the west coast of Australia a significant military presence, especially a naval presence, because so much of our trade&mdash;especially with the Middle East, Africa and certainly Europe&mdash;crosses the Indian Ocean. Therefore, it is essential that we have a naval facility on the western coast which could protect the trade routes into and out of Australian territorial waters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This project covers a number of elements: the helicopter support facility, the final stage of the power development project, and further training facilities including facilities for the submarine training centre which will support the presence of the Collins class submarines based at Garden Island. Overall, this is a major project. It will cost nearly $48 million but will go a significant part of the distance towards ensuring that by the year 2000 we will have on the west coast of Australia a totally integrated military technological capacity with support facilities for the Australian navy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday afternoon, before debate on the appropriation bills was interrupted, I was speaking of the fear many Gippslanders have in relation to the build-up of fuel in the Great Dividing Range and the East Gippsland forests. This concern is directed at the failure of various authorities to engage in sufficient and regular fuel reduction burnings. It is no exaggeration to say that many East Gippslanders believe that, unless urgent steps are taken to reduce the amount of scrub and bush that has grown up over hundreds of thousands of hectares, we will face circumstances as catastrophic as those New South Wales faced during its recent disastrous fires.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I hasten to add that it is not just East Gippsland which is at risk. There is growing concern in South Gippsland also at the failure of authorities to engage in fuel reduction burning. This leads to a very dangerous situation. Mr Bill Davies, a much respected former president of the Shire of South Gippsland, wrote a letter to the Shire of South Gippsland on this very issue. I believe that Mr Davies's warnings, based on his experience of living and working throughout this region, must be taken with the utmost seriousness. Allow me to quote from that submission:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am very concerned that there are areas of Crown Land in our shire where the fire danger is growing rapidly because of lack of controlled burning.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst there has been some controlled burning in the Wilsons Promontory National Park I believe that there needs to be larger areas burnt each year otherwise there will eventually be a total disaster out there, especially in the area originally known as the back of Yanakie.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On a recent visit out there I noticed that since the grazing of cattle has ceased in the area known as the old aerodrome, the manuka scrub is starting to spread. If something is not done about this the whole area from the entrance of the park to Tidal River will become one big death trap. If a fire gets going out there on a bad day there will be no way of stopping it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another area of great concern to me is the Crown Land to the west of Waratah Bay. There are some fire tracks there but I feel that they too are death traps as they are not wide enough. Other areas of Crown Land around Foster could also pose serious problems on a day of high temperature and winds.</PARA>
<PARA>I wish to place on the public record of the debate on the bills before the House the concern of so many Gippslanders and, I believe, Victorians at large that the lessons of the New South Wales bushfires will not be learnt. The authorities, particularly the state government of Victoria, are now on notice that urgent action is needed if we are to minimise&mdash;we can never totally eliminate&mdash;the risk of bushfires. I certainly intend forwarding a copy of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> as well as the representations made to me by East and South Gippslanders to the relevant ministers in Victoria. I certainly look forward to a complete review of the fuel reduction policies and actions of various state departments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my comments to the general appropriation strategy of the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development and refer to some of the underlying theoretical approaches that are appropriate in that area. Historically, in the industry policy area Australia has oscillated between a number of different theoretical approaches. The neoclassical approach of non-intervention, of allowing the markets to rule, has always been an influential player in debates although rarely followed absolutely. The crude protectionist approach, encompassing high tariff walls and blanket assistance to industry, has essentially dominated Australian industry policy for most of this century. Also influential in the debate, although again rarely applied to any great extent, is what I would describe as the political economy approach. It could also perhaps be described as a statist approach of selective intervention in various sectors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The neoclassical approach to industry policy is intrinsically flawed because it fails to acknowledge the influence of externalities, particularly the role of technological change, the implications of environmental damage and a variety of other issues that are simply not recognised in the theoretical model. It is also flawed because it treats all industries the same. We all remember the famous comment by a member of the Reagan administration: `Microchips and potato chips, it is all just chips, what is the difference?'. Different industries and different types of products have a variety of different spin-offs and obviously different multiplier effects. The neoclassical approach sees competitive advantage as essentially a static thing and something which is largely bestowed upon a country by factors such as land, location and natural resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I have described as the crude protectionist approach is also intrinsically flawed. That is increasingly recognised across the political spectrum in this country. It tends to entrench inefficiency and direct resources into the wrong areas, into inward looking industries, and limit the amount of resources that can be directed towards potentially export oriented and internationally competitive industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The political economy approach, which has essentially been the approach endorsed by the left in Australian politics over many years, has been put into some difficulty by the internationalisation of our economy. There is still substantial merit in this approach. But one thing that needs to be acknowledged is that the effective internationalisation of Australia's economy over the past 10 or 15 years has rendered much of the policy approaches within the political economy school of thought ineffective or just downright wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we move towards an industry statement or part of a broader statement relating to industry policy, my concern is that we are drifting into a more ad hoc approach&mdash;back to the 1970s in some respects&mdash;where we will be assisting certain industries and providing certain packages and particular initiatives without having a broad theoretical framework underpinning what we do. Contrary to the headline in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, which I hasten to correct, I am a strong interventionist. The article was accurate, but the headline was not. It is important, as the government moves away from a fairly strong market forces oriented industry policy to a more interventionist policy, that there is a serious theoretical underpinning of that policy. It should not just be on the basis, `Oh, it seems like a good idea' or `Other countries are doing it' or `Commonsense suggests that we should do this' or `Pragmatic considerations dominate'. We need to have an underlying theory. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would leave that one up in the air for the time being. There have been a lot of developments in theory in this area in recent times. I want to refer to a few of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Strategic trade theory is one which essentially acknowledges that what has been occurring in the world in recent years is a major change in the structure of trade. Increasingly, trade is being dominated by intra-corporate trade with increases in factors such as barter and the like. Externalities now dominate international trade. It is characterised by oligopolistic tendencies. Therefore, notions of free market forces are inappropriate in that sort of context. It is logical and appropriate for government to intervene in order to assist internationally competitive industries within its territory to compete within that environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New growth theory is a recent development which actually had its origins back in the 1950s but effectively came into its own in the mid-1980s. This theory challenges the neoclassical model with respect to the issue of externalities. It argues basically that the key force in economic growth is technological change and the development of human and technological capital, as such, and that there is a major role for government to play in stimulating growth and development in those areas. The private sector tends to underinvest in things like human capital, development of technology and research and development primarily because the benefits of such investment accrue very substantially to the world at large and less to the private individual or corporation that actually achieves the breakthrough. Therefore, there is a major role for government in assisting that sort of process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has also been a substantial school of thought that could be described under the title `post-Fordism' or with the term `networking'; the two approaches tend to merge into one. This argues basically that a massive change is going on in the whole structure of economic activity in the industrialised world, that the old days of large factories with Taylorist production lines&mdash;with individual workers involved in very precise but very limited activities that did not involve much use of their brains and was all organised in a rigid hierarchy&mdash;are rapidly disappearing; and that production more and more is becoming located in smaller corporations with highly flexible, highly skilled workers, often linked to each other in networks and performing a range of different parts of the production process, rather than the entire whole, as was the case previously in the typical Fordist-type factory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Michael Porter, in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Competitive Advantage of Nations</EMPHASIS> and in other works, has put forward a fairly comprehensive theoretical approach that relates primarily to industry policy but is also relevant to broader economic policy. The essence of Porter's argument is that the key factors in international competitiveness now are what he describes as advanced factors such as skills, the capacity to innovate and the like, and that basic factors such as natural resources, land and location are becoming less and less important in a country's international competitiveness relative to these advanced factors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> What Porter also argues is that it is possible for government and society to create advanced factors and that there is a major role for government intervention in economic activity in order to enhance the creation of advanced factors that will make a major contribution to international competitiveness. The types of areas that are involved include: education, research and development, marketing, innovation, communications and the like. The best competitive advantage is based on these advanced factors and not on the basis of reducing costs and the basic factors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Robert Reich has also contributed substantially to this debate in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Work of Nations</EMPHASIS> in which he argues that the national economy is effectively disappearing in the way that we have known it and that the critical issue which now faces us is primarily what work is actually being done by the people in any nation. He believes that the key focus of economic policy, industry policy and the like should be on education and training. This is because the skills of our work force and the nature of the work that is actually being performed by our workers up and down the hierarchy are the critical factors which will determine our standard of living and our wealth. This has also been pushed further by Ray Marshall whom I had the pleasure of meeting yesterday. He has co-authored a book with Mark Tucker called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Thinking for a Living</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Based on all of these theoretical developments and a number of other things, I would suggest that the key aspects of our industry policy should be based on the following themes. Policies that run counter to internationalisation will almost certainly be ineffective and possibly harmful. The promotion of high quality education and training is probably the paramount thing that government can do to assist in economic development. Industry policy should focus primarily on indirect assistance through the enhancement of factors such as research and development, access to capital, use of advanced technology and the availability of skilled workers. Obsessive interest in costs will produce limited benefits. Government intervention can enhance the overall economic development of a nation if it is founded on a comprehensive overall strategy. Assistance directed at linkages between firms, between industries and between sectors is just as important as assistance directed at individual firms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Intervention should also focus on issues like work organisation and factory design, factors that are critical in competitiveness but that tend to be left behind a bit in the debate. Government has a vital role in fostering the flow of ideas and innovation through industry, acting as a knowledge broker. Industry policy should be directed to achieving the broadest possible internationally competitive industrial base, not the broadest possible industrial base per se, nor the status quo. Assistance should be targeted, not indiscriminate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the modern industrial economy is, in my view, so complex that the crude application of any single theory will not necessarily produce the results that theory indicates should occur. We have moved a long, long way from industrial Europe of the 1870s&mdash;or, indeed, the 1820s&mdash;when some of the basic theories such as the neoclassical school, Marxist economics and the like first emerged. The society with which we are now dealing is radically different from the societies around which those theories were developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can see a lot of the theoretical developments that I have referred to in the structural changes that have been occurring in the economies throughout the Western world, including our own. There is clearly a growth in smaller firms. The phenomenon of networking is taking off in many countries and is providing the basis of competitive advantage in a number of European countries in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Specialisation in particular parts of the production process, the development of flexible manufacturing technology through the use of microelectronics and smart machines is having a major impact. More contracting out of particular functions is occurring&mdash;not because of new right conspiracies, attempts to break unions or to beat on-costs but primarily because the economics of contracting out, as opposed to doing things in-house, has altered as a result of technological change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The spread of advanced manufacturing technology&mdash;unfortunately Australia is behind most of the rest of the industrialised world in this area&mdash;is also instituting substantial change. I would recommend to honourable members the work of the Cooperative Research Centre for Intelligent Decision Systems in Melbourne which is doing some landmark work in this area. The distinction between manufacturing and services is blurring because the distinction between goods and services is blurring. Lots of goods that are now produced are linked to services. They have services built in which are related to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Internationalisation is something that we are all aware of. I would urge honourable members to keep in mind the fact that internationalisation should be truly international. Yes, we do have to look at Asia but everybody else is too. Opportunities are coming down the track in the world beyond Asia. The next tigers should be where we are focusing on just as much. I think Latin America is a fairly good example of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has problems to deal with. We still have an export sector that is absolutely dominated by resource industries. We have limited clustering of our industries and huge gaps. We have very low levels of advanced manufacturing technology take-up. Our management quality is, in general, substantially inferior to most of the industrialised world. We have a low savings ratio. We have declining investment in infrastructure. We have foreign ownership, which in itself is not a problem but when it involves restrictions on the ability of the Australian subsidiary to export to other countries&mdash;for example in the case of ICI&mdash;then it is a problem; whereas other countries tend to do the reverse and allow foreign ownership and investment on the basis that export will occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have an incredibly fragmented domestic market and regulatory structure which is yet another disastrous product of our outrageously outdated three-tiered system of government. There are weaknesses in conventional solutions, as I have indicated before. Market forces, if left to rule, will ensure that we remain, in Michael Porter's terms, a factor driven economy, vulnerable to cyclical fluctuations and essentially dependent upon natural resource based industries. Therefore, relative to the rest of the world, we will continue to decline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indiscriminate protection, and that includes indiscriminate import replacement and indiscriminate use of government purchasing, will essentially impede the development of international competitiveness. By themselves, those sorts of strategies have some merit, if they are targeted to particular industries that have export competitiveness potential, but an indiscriminate approach will simply distract attention from the main game, which is international competitiveness, and will ensure that we effectively reintroduce the tariff wall by another means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not so much critical of notions such as import replacement per se. I argue that we have to ask: what imports are we replacing? There are certain imports that we should not be trying to replace. It is a logical strategy to pursue others which offer potential competitive opportunities for Australia in order to boost our export opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A key issue which the government has to confront is that we have not yet outgrown the obsession with costs. We discovered 10 or so years ago that we have a bit of a problem internationally which we have to deal with. The basic mistake we are making is assuming that the only problem we have is with costs and that, therefore, everybody is trumpeting about micro-economic reform, the Hilmer report and various other things. That is a backward looking strategy. If people read Michael Porter and various other works, they will see why. It fails to address the real issues with respect to competitive advantage, such as quality, innovation and research and development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We may be able to reduce our costs to business by having lower electricity prices. Big deal! Exactly the same types of things will be going on amongst our competitors, in spades. The issue is: are we improving the quality of our product? Are we developing new innovations that lead the world? That is where the real gain is. Unfortunately, the obsession with costs is creating a situation in which people in business are able to blame everybody else but themselves for Australia's economic problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an incredible culture in business of people believing their own propaganda. They believe that it is all the government's fault, that it is all this regulation and that it is all these additional cost burdens and the like. There are certain situations in which that is true, but it is a minor part of the equation. We have to shift the focus away from those things and divest ourselves of our obsession with costs. We need to tackle the problems; that is fine. But we need to focus on the real game. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currency manipulation is another issue which is basically a bit of a dead end. It can produce short-term results, but again it does not really affect the key factors in international competitiveness in the longer term. We need to be a bit wary of things such as industry plans, which sound good and had significant success in the 1980s in certain sectors. Industry plans in the TCF, vehicle and steel industries were very good. Those industries are mature industries that were in crisis at the time. They are fairly highly unionised and are capable of a tripartite approach. A lot of the emerging industries are not in the same situation. So if we are to have things called industry plans, I suggest they will be radically different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to be wary of cargo cult attitudes to things such as big projects. In my view, Australia has not ever psychologically recovered from the Snowy Mountains scheme. We are all searching out there for the Holy Grail of the great big project that will save the day. We need to be wary of getting into dutch auctions with other countries for the favours of multinational corporations. At the end of the day, their decisions will largely be driven by basic factors such as the quality of our work force, the stability of our political system and our access to markets rather than particular tax breaks that are offered. There is probably a place for some of that, but we have to be very wary not to get too far into that. If we do, we should be getting good deals out of it, such as the Taiwanese do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indiscriminate tax concessions such as the research and development tax concession worry me a bit. On balance, that tax concession has probably been a good thing. It has probably made a significant contribution, but I feel it is much more effective to target things such as that pro-actively. Therefore, in my view, the types of initiatives that the government should be pursuing are things like substantially boosting the cooperative research centres program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recommend that honourable members visit the cooperative research centres in their areas. I have already visited a couple and I am going to a couple more. Some of the work that is going on there is very worth while. It is bringing together some of the innovative companies with people in universities, the CSIRO, et cetera, who are working on innovation and developing new products and new techniques. That sort of work will form the basis of Australia's international competitiveness in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is just starting to get involved with stimulating networking. The Danish experience here is stark. A relatively small investment of $30 million in a networking program has been a key factor in a massive turnaround in the Danish economy in the past few years. There are a number of other examples, such as more intensive export assistance and more direct expenditure in education and training. There needs to be much greater commitment in that area. Breaking down the segmentation between different disciplines is also important. Concentrating on the export prospects of our services industry such as the law, engineering and education should also be vitally important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key thing is to deliver assistance indirectly through things such as marketing assistance, management consultancies, the cooperative research centres and technology advice, as has been done effectively throughout our history by CSIRO and the agricultural departments with people in the rural sector. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the response of the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) to the Burdekin report is instructive. Burdekin found, among many other chronic problems, a crisis among homeless young people, and mounting problems among those afflicted with psychiatric illnesses such as manic depression and schizophrenia. Burdekin, who has a long association with Labor personalities, has been both shamed and ashamed by the government's response. The so-called party of compassion has responded with slow derision to his clear manifestation of the plight of the homeless and the mentally ill. Frankly, as far as the homeless young people and those with psychiatric illnesses are concerned, the government could not care less. </PARA>

He craves popularity, but thinks he has to court the tertiary graduates of the sociology and political marketing schools to get it. In the meantime, while Australians endure the ambitions of the new yuppies, the process of reform, initiated by former Senator Walsh and others, comes to a halt like a Mahler coda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened to dealing with chronic unemployment? Too hard. What has happened to industrial relations reform? Stopped. What has happened to waterfront reform, as we have seen in recent days? Halted. What has happened to taxation reform? Dead. What has happened to welfare targeting? The government has lost interest. What has happened to health and hospital reform? Gone, as Dr Blewett has gone. What has happened to privatisation? Slowed to a crawl. What has happened to law reform? That is going to be impossible after the sports rorts affair. What has happened to administrative services reform? It stopped at a cost to the budget of $240 million a year. What has happened with cooperative federalism reforms? That went with Bob Hawke. Despite the Prime Minister's platitudes yesterday, we will find that cooperative federalism, which is very important in our nation&mdash;which came together as a federation and is the compact of our federation&mdash;has also stopped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The clear message from those answers is: the Prime Minister and his mates started with the reform agenda but got waylaid by the yuppies, the media agenda settlers and the special interest groups on the way. Social and economic reform has stopped, but the big handout bash is on. If you cannot get re-elected by respect; get re-elected by lies and bribes. This is a sad story for a caravan which began its journey with such hopes. The Prime Minister must face the dreadful fact for his ambitions: his relentless pursuit of power and his popularity amongst favoured interest groups has isolated him from his native Sydney. He is now out of place without the power of the public purse, so he intends to buy his way into what he calls culture. We will shortly get a cultural statement from the Prime Minister and one of his speech writers. The title is already abroad&mdash;in honour of the dead poets society it will be called the bought writers society. </PARA>

But there is some emerging panic in government ranks because the Prime Minister no longer has an economic policy with Walsh and Dawkins gone. He is permanently unpopular with the electorate. The great majority of the work force does not want the ACTU and its Halfpennys and Keltys, as evidenced by declining interest in trade union membership. The Prime Minister's act of pretending to be a Bankstown Mitterand is a joke to most of Labor's remaining believers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had hoped that these appropriation bills would give some indication of the government's directions, but the Prime Minister's minders and the ACTU interactive communicators are already in election mode.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a couple of matters that the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale) referred to in his speech to which I want to respond but, in the first instance, I make the point that Appropriation Bills Nos 2 and 3 and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) do provide, as has been observed by a number of honourable members, an opportunity for honourable members to range across economic, social and political issues about which they are concerned. It is one of those few occasions I suppose when legislation lends itself to that type of approach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I congratulate the new honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) on his maiden speech yesterday. The honourable member follows in the great tradition of his predecessors in Werriwa. The former Labor leader and Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, a great Australian and a man of great and exceptional vision, represented Werriwa. He was followed then by John Kerin, one of the most successful and highly regarded ministers for primary industry from any party this parliament has had since Federation. The honourable member's contribution yesterday makes it clear that he is an appropriate inheritor and custodian of those traditions in Werriwa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a marked contrast between the younger people that the Labor Party brings into this parliament and the people that the opposition brings into this parliament. Of course, this is one of the reasons now why people are increasingly recognising the fact that the opposition is largely devoid of talent, largely devoid of depth on its backbench and has a deficient but overflowing front bench with all of the problems associated with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Werriwa is a graduate in economics. He has done a lot of research work. He has been involved in local government. He was a young mayor of Liverpool. He has a very strong background and experience and has been able to develop all of the necessary talents for him to make a contribution not only to his electorate and those people that he directly represents but also to this parliament and to this nation. He will do that. I would not agree with all of the things that the honourable member said yesterday nor the emphasis that he placed on them, but it was an intelligent assessment, an intelligent statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our members and our new members come in here with some spirit in their soul, with some fire in their bellies and with some brains in their heads. That is why this government undoubtedly will be in office for a long time despite those absurd amateur theatricals that we saw this morning from the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) and the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson). They were nothing more than amateur theatricals. At least one of those honourable members is positioning himself for the leadership tussle which is under way now, and which everyone knows must be resolved if the opposition is at least to settle back into its usual sloth and complacency. Opposition members were attempting this morning to lift their profiles. They are making their bids for the future and they are doing it on very tenuous and very shaky grounds. We were not fooled by that burlesque. We were not fooled at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said before in connection with the sports grants affair that there was no necessary form of administration for ministers to adopt. There is a responsibility for ministers to carry out the tasks with which they have been charged and to act in accordance with the legislation under which they operate. The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) clearly did that. She exercised the discretion which is rightly given to ministers. She administered a $30 million program. A great deal of continuing criticism has been made about the way in which the minister chose to make those decisions. She had a responsibility to make those decisions&mdash;and she made them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assertions that have been made are pretty shallow. I am one of those people who, like most members of the government, like to keep an eye on what the opposition is up to.</PARA>
<PARA>Just before the last election, I took special note of the rebuild Australia fund which the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) indicated would be a centrepiece of its election policies. The opposition indicated that it was prepared to commit $3 billion to that rebuild Australia fund if it were successful in that election. As the opposition made its promises, I totalled them up. The honourable member for Bruce, when referring to the government and the sports grants affair, said `using the funds of hardworking Australians to bribe interest groups'. He also suggested in his closing remarks that the opposition in government would conduct `honest elections without bribes'. Honourable members on this side are not fooled.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The table is headed `Coalition's Rebuild Australia Fund: Promises and Implied Commitments'. Reference has been made in the House to that promise made on the run by the Leader of the Opposition about providing a university at Cairns for a total cost of $30 million&mdash;the total amount of the sports and recreation program. Honourable members should hear about some of these projects. By the way, in the table I have identified the project, indicated who made the promise, indicated when the promise was made, given the source&mdash;so if people want to question these they can go back to the source, the newspapers&mdash;and indicated the cost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first project is the very fast train&mdash;$1,500 million. That is half of the rebuild Australia fund in one hit. That promise was made by the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) and the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran). The second project is a four-lane highway from Sydney to Orange. Honourable members will recall that I was Minister for Land Transport at that time. That project was costed between $600 million and $1,000 million. There is not much left in the rebuild Australia fund, but the list goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next project is the Alice Springs to Darwin rail link. The Leader of the Opposition made a promise to put $1,500 million into that project on 10 February last year, just before the election, but that was superseded by a commitment made on 6 March by the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) who had a more sensible estimate of $300 million&mdash;and it was endorsed by the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other projects are a special infrastructure package for South Australia, $300 million; Goulburn-Canberra to complete the four-lane highway, $160 million to $260 million; and Cairns-Port Douglas light rail, $70 million. The cost of the Pichi Richi rail is unstated, so we can add whatever that unstated amount is to the total that I will indicate shortly. The total will stun you, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew, because you are a man of perception. The honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), who has a genuine interest in rail, promised National Rail expenditure over three years of $774 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next project on the table is Badgerys Creek unspecified transport infrastructure&mdash;$50 million. Honourable members will recall infrastructure associated with the sugar package&mdash;$23 million. The next project is the Cairns university, which we have been hearing a lot about. When the Leader of the Opposition was asked how he estimated that $30 million, honourable members will recall that he wrote on the back of an envelope, `10 by three'&mdash;$30 million. The opposition thought that it would win that electorate, and of course it did not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next project is to compensate New South Wales for uniform heavy vehicle registration charges&mdash;$14 million to $75 million. Another project is a capital projects `kick start' grant to Tasmania. We know what the opposition was seeking to do at that time in Tasmania&mdash;hold the seats. We grabbed another two back. So Tasmanians were not fooled by this nonsense. That project was going to cost $80 million. The next project is the Alice Springs to Darwin rail link that came back in March last year&mdash;$300 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Farrer, the rail enthusiast, promised an annual boost to rail of $258 million. Just before the election, the opposition looked at the map of those electorates and said, `What type of commitment can we make now to clean up all of those electorates between Nambour in Queensland and Melbourne?'. It said, `Let's make a commitment to a four-lane highway', which it did&mdash;$3,500 million. The rebuild Australia fund was going to provide only $3,000 million and here the final project was going to cost $3,500 million. The total cost of the projects, which were to be financed out of a $3,000 million fund, is $7.6 billion&mdash;more than twice the amount that was to be provided in that fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of claims made by those opposite that this government has been using funds of hardworking Australians to bribe interest groups and that the opposition in government would have honest elections without bribes, this table will go into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> now as a permanent record, and my colleagues can refer to it from time to time. There was only one reason that that rebuild Australia fund was mentioned: it was to be a vehicle for the opposition in election mode to go around this nation dispensing promises like confetti&mdash;as it did. Those opposite all know that when the interest groups came to them in the campaign and suggested some particular project that they were interested in the response was, `That would lend itself well to our rebuild Australia fund'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a list of those promises taken generally from state and national media. All those other promises that were made on the run are not on this list. If they were included as well I would hesitate to guess what the total cost would come to, but it gives the lie to some of those claims that have been made. It shows their superficiality. It shows that it is just a veneer of political rhetoric. There is no substance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every one of those projects that the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories approved is a project on the ground. They are visible to everyone. Let the Australian community not be fooled by the political rhetoric undertaken by the opposition. It is a sham. It is a fraud. It is not genuine. It lacks substance. It lacks integrity. There is no basis for those claims, and we simply reject them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make mention of something else which happened in the context of that last election campaign. We recall that things were really not going well for the opposition, as was shown by the election result. Things were not going very well for the opposition at all. So of course it was necessary for the opposition to blame someone. But it did not blame just one group or one person. Let me remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, who was attacked by the Leader of the Opposition in the context of that election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are all the groups, authorities, institutions and individuals who were blamed by the Leader of the Opposition for the problems which the opposition was experiencing which reflected themselves in the opposition's electoral defeat. There was the Australian Taxation Office; the federal Treasury; the Reserve Bank of Australia; BHP, particularly managing director Prescott; the Catholic Bishops Committee&mdash;for God's sake; the Catholic Social Welfare Commission; renters; car companies; nurses; teachers; the ABC; unions; the ACTU; people who do not drive; people who do not have children; Gough Whitlam; ACOSS; the Japanese; environmentalists; and business leaders. Mr Chaney, a former member of this House, in Western Australia went so far as to claim that the Catholic Church is a leftist body. All of that is documented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me quote just a couple of the particular statements made in reference to them. The statement about people who do not drive and do not have kids was made by the Leader of the Opposition in connection with the New South Wales Opposition Leader, Bob Carr. On 17 October 1992 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You've got to be suspicious of a guy that doesn't drive and doesn't like kids and things like that.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know what `things' like kids are, but `things like that'. Of former Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam on 25 July 1992 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Gough Whitlam's greatest contribution to Australia was "AIDS&mdash;the Acquired Income Dependency Syndrome."</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to renters he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In any street, of course, it's always easy to tell the rented houses. They're the ones where the lawn isn't mowed, the plants aren't watered and the fences aren't fixed.</PARA>
<PARA>Do you know who wrote that for him, Mr Deputy Speaker? It was Tony Abbott, the Liberal candidate for Warringah. He is the bloke who said that he wanted to come here and complete the duo of Abbott and Costello, the bloke who said he wanted to come in here in order to make sure that his electorate had an `Abbott' to match the Bishop next door. He will be an interesting bloke. These are the young men that the opposition collects. He is from the last century. He is the head of the anti-republican push. Of welfare organisations the Leader of the Opposition said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You can go through the welfare industry . . . You've got your mates, you've got your professional lobbyists; the professional basket weavers; the massive community that has been built up in the welfare bureaucracy&mdash;most of them are the winners.</PARA>
<PARA>People in welfare are the winners? Of the Catholic Social Welfare Commission he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately, the bit of their report I've read, it was a bit of a carping, whingeing, negative assessment of a proposal in isolation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>About the environmentalists he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Who are the winners in the environment debate? A few Green leaders and their mates, and some sympathetic leaders of the Aboriginal heritage movement.</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Liberal Party said about business leaders:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They've fallen into the game, this incestuous relationship with government. They've become part of the problem.</PARA>
<PARA>What did he say about Ford chief Jac Nasser and John Prescott? He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Maybe they're not sufficiently aware of the potential this country has got. Maybe they've been used to being protected and molly-coddled by government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>So we can go on. I do not need any more time; my time is just about finished in this debate, not in this parliament. The fight we take to the opposition is a fight that we will continue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to these appropriation bills now before the House I intend to deal with several current and compelling issues of national security. These bills cover a number of key organisations vitally concerned with national security, principally the Department of Defence but also the Office of National Assessments, ONA, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, ASIS, and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, ASIO.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the minds of some people, the collapse of European communism has substantially reduced or even eliminated national security concerns and consequently the need for a significant appropriation to defence and an adequate security and intelligence apparatus. Such an approach is naive and potentially dangerous, for an increasingly diverse and complex range of security problems remain even in respect of Russia itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are all aware of the dramatic seizure of power in September 1993 by the Russian President, Boris Yeltsin, and his accompanying dismissal of the Russian parliament, the Congress of Peoples Deputies, which capped two years of endemic instability in Russia. Since Mr Yeltsin emerged as the most powerful political figure in the former Soviet Union over 2 1/2 years ago, we have witnessed an economic collapse of appalling dimensions as a decaying planned economy clashed head-on with the shock therapy, free-market approach of the IMF. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As no commonsense transitional arrangements between two diametrically opposed economic systems were ever effected, the result has been internal chaos, rising poverty and widespread corruption. As one measure of the corruption involved, it is estimated that the nomenklatura, the Russian bureaucratic military and business class, have set aside $US100 billion since the mid-1980s, most of it going into western bank accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The excesses of the shock therapy approach have now been belatedly recognised with its principle architect, the first deputy prime minister, Yegor Gaidar, resigning on 16 January last. Other resignations have since followed, including that of the finance minister, Mr Boris Fyodorov. However, the damage has been irreparably done. Though communism as we traditionally knew it in Russia is now fortuitously buried in history, the revulsion of the Russian people against the state of penury to which their country has been reduced is undoubtedly giving birth to a new form of Russian nationalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the Russian intellectual who was long on the outer with the old communist regime, has given an excellent insight into two of the principle strands of thought that underpin the new nationalism. The first is a great thirst for order of which he has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The people have a right to power, but the people do not want power. Only 2% have the desire for power; before all else, they want order.</PARA>
<PARA>The borders determining what is Russian soil are for Solzhenitsyn the second element defining Russian nationalism. To him `our thousand-year history' means that contemporary Russia must have the borders of the ancient `Rus' or `Rossya', including the Russian Federation, Belarus, or white Russia, the Ukraine and also the Russian populated north-central Kazakhstan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context it is worth noting that, under pressure from Moscow, Belarus is actually moving closer to ending its nominal independence and for all practical purposes is being reabsorbed into Russia. Moreover, its government is overwhelmingly in the hands of the former Soviet nomenklatura. Likewise, the Ukraine is moving back towards Russia, having signed on 17 July 1993 in Moscow the initial agreement for a Slavic economic union binding Russia, Belarus and the Ukraine. As well, the Ukraine was forced at the beginning of this year by combined Russian and American pressure to hand over administrative control of its nuclear arsenal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Russia, it should be noted, is also heavily backing the ethnic Russian majority in the Crimea region of the Ukraine who wish to join Russia. In addition, the Russian military is believed to be covertly active in a number of the republics of the former Soviet Union, most notably during last year in the Abkhazia region of Georgia where it was allegedly backing local separatists against the government of Georgian President, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze. As a result, Georgia was forced into seeking support and assistance from Russia to deal with a siege situation which Russia, from all accounts, played no small part in creating and sustaining. Georgia is today still heavily dependent on the Russian military and navy to resolve local difficulties, as witnessed the defence treaty with Russia which Mr Shevardnadze had no option but to sign earlier this month. Moreover, on 18 January, only a few weeks ago, the Russian foreign minister, Mr Andrei Kozyrez, made it plain that Russia intended to maintain a continuing presence in the Baltic states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This new and aggressive Russian nationalism, notwithstanding the fact that it is at this stage essentially confined to crudely exerting influence over certain republics of the former Soviet Union, is a matter still requiring an exercise of due diligence by the security and intelligence services of the Western democracies. Anyone with residual doubts as to such necessity should have them resolved by the rising prominence of the Russian ultranationalist leader, Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, whose Liberal Democrats' strong showing in the pre-Christmas parliamentary elections shocked people both inside and outside Russia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the Western democracies should, in addition, be under no illusion that the Russian security services are alive and well, even if they have undergone massive reorganisation since the attempted coup in August 1991. A document produced by the Directorate of Intelligence of the United States Central Intelligence Agency, the CIA, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Russian security services: sorting out the pieces</EMPHASIS> and dated September 1992, clearly illustrates by text and diagram how then USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev dismantled the KGB and created different agencies from its various departments and directorates, how these organisations changed as the Soviet Union collapsed, and how they have stabilised at present under Russian jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of the four principal Russian security organisations identified by the CIA was the ministry of security of the Russian federation, the MBRF, which was established in January 1992. The MBRF oversaw internal security, counter-narcotics, counterintelligence, counter-terrorism and economic security. Since early June 1992, it did also have responsibility for the Russian border troops. During its first 18 months, the MBRF was headed by Colonel-General Viktor Barannikov, who was dismissed by Mr Yeltsin in July 1993. Failure by the MBRF to assess the growing strength of the ultranationalist Mr Zhirinovsky, caused President Yeltsin to disband the organisation a few days before last Christmas. A new federal counterintelligence service has been created in its stead, headed by Mr Nikolai Golushko, former chief of the old Soviet KGB in the Ukraine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Foreign intelligence is now collected by the Russian foreign intelligence service, the SVRR. At the time of the compilation of the CIA document, the director was Yevgeniy Primakov who, it is understood, still runs the SVRR today. Primakov's earlier service was largely with the first chief directorate of the KGB, the body once responsible for foreign intelligence gathering. He has publicly claimed that the SVRR will reduce intelligence collection in the west. This claim is debatable. On the most generous interpretation there has simply been a greater emphasis on industrial and economic espionage, previously by the first chief directorate of the KGB and more latterly by the SVRR. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third main organisation detailed by the CIA is the ministry of internal affairs, the MVD, which is the successor to the Russian MVD and the USSR MVD. Its functions are the same as those of its predecessor organisations and, in some areas, the now defunct MBRF, that is, maintaining prison facilities and fighting narcotics, organised crime and terrorism. Lieutenant-General Viktor Yerin was head of the MVD in September 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">FAPSI, the federal agency for government communications and information, is the fourth main security organisation. This agency combines the cryptography, communications interception and communication departments of the former USSR KGB. It is also responsible for maintaining secure communication lines for the President and the security services. The general director of FAPSI in September 1992 was Lieutenant-General Aleksandr Starovoytov. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the decades following the Second World War and now, Russian diplomatic personnel have played a major role in foreign intelligence gathering, most especially in the Western democracies. So overt was that activity between 1970 and 1987, 691 Soviet intelligence officers were expelled from various countries around the world. Even neighbouring New Zealand, limited in size and population as it is, found it necessary to throw out six Soviet diplomats during that same period. In marked contrast, Australia has taken little action against Soviet diplomats known to be hostile intelligence officers, except for the Petrov affair in 1955 and the Coombe-Ivanov affair in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The admission of Valeriy Zemskov to Australia in early 1986, which I dealt with in some detail in the grievance debate of 20 October 1988, is a classic illustration of Australia's inaction. In the months preceding his arrival, Mr Zemskov was identified as a member of the elite KGB special reserve yet, against security advice, was allowed by the federal Labor government to take up his post as minister-counsellor at the Soviet embassy in Canberra and serve out his term. During his time here, Mr Zemskov was left free to pursue the then Soviet objectives of undermining the ANZUS military alliance with the United States and push for the entry of Soviet trawlers to Australian waters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding the collapse of European communism and the disintegration of the former Soviet Union, the new Russian federation has still maintained a substantial intelligence presence in Australia and, in fact, increased it over recent years. Right up to last year there were believed to be up to 10 to 12 Russian intelligence officers in this country, with up to six of them on the diplomatic list. Most were members of the new Russian foreign intelligence service, the SVRR, and some were members of Russian military intelligence, the GRU. The SVRR is, of course, the Russian successor to the KGB, as discussed earlier, while the GRU has remained organisationally intact, despite the dramatic political changes in Russia. Until the middle of 1993, the head of residence for Russian foreign intelligence in Canberra was Mr Vladimir Grouzdev, shown as a counsellor on the diplomatic list of 12 July 1993. One of his key lieutenants was Mr Mikhail Tchoupakhine, who was on the same list as a third secretary, consular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Continuing security vigilance by Australia is therefore crucial, especially when it is pointed out that several Russian foreign intelligence and military intelligence officers have had to leave Australia from both the Russian embassy in Canberra and the Russian consulate in Sydney. The departures have involved at least three Russian foreign intelligence officers and at least two GRU officers. Moscow has been informed by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs that these exits of Russian intelligence officers were to take place over an extended period, that these officers are not welcome in Australia ever again, and that reprisals by Russia are unwarranted. This is no great hardship because no Australian intelligence officers operate under diplomatic cover in the Russian federation. In fact, despite all that is now happening in Russia, nothing is apparently done by Australia covertly that might upset the Russians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those Russian intelligence officers being asked to leave Australia have been engaged in espionage against the Commonwealth of Australia, most particularly counterespionage against the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, ASIO. All this fervent activity is in the wake of vital information received about the extraordinary extent of Russian intelligence activities in Australia from other Western intelligence services. </PARA>

What is really disturbing Australia's other security and intelligence services about ASIO and those of our key Western allies is far more alarming.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debate on the appropriation bills can cover a very wide range of subjects, although I was surprised at the nature of the discussion by the previous speaker because it was only very tangentially related to the bills that we are debating. I would like to return the House to the core issue we are discussing, which is public fiscal policy and the revisions to the appropriation bills that were passed earlier in the financial year&mdash;in other words, the budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his Australia Day speech the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) rightly said that unemployment is the principal problem facing Australia at present, and I do not think that anybody in the community would disagree with that. Fortunately, the government has commissioned and has now received a report on what can be done about unemployment: the green paper on restoring full employment, which was tabled in this House at the end of last year. That report is very significant because it begins by saying that today the nation's No. 1 priority is to find jobs for unemployed Australians. It goes on a little later to say that full employment is the ultimate goal. The green paper is absolutely right in asserting those goals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It makes some recommendations about policies for increasing employment opportunities for the long-term unemployed and for changing the way in which income support is provided. It also contains a number of other subsidiary policies. The green paper rightly says that the principal requirement for the reduction of unemployment is sustained strong economic growth. We must continue to aim for that. But it also says, quite rightly, that that alone will not be enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The points that I want to make in this speech relate to additional policies which might contribute to increasing employment opportunities as well as strong economic growth. I think a number of points have been missing from the public debate about these issues, and I will mention them. The principal point is that most of the employment growth has to occur in service industries. About two-thirds of the Australian employed work force are now working in the service sector. Lots of people imagine our manufacturing sector, or our primary sector, or our construction sector to be larger than one-third of the work force. In fact, two-thirds of the work force are employed in services, mostly in human services. There are some very good examples of that in both the private and the public sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A service area of particularly strong growth in the private sector is tourism, which is now one of the fastest growing industries in Australia. In fact, estimates published early in the 1990s were that during the decade of the 1990s about an additional 200,000 people would be employed in tourism, mainly in small businesses&mdash;in many parts of Australia&mdash;contributing to tourist opportunities for both Australians and overseas visitors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another very important private sector industry in the services area which is growing strongly is information technology&mdash;computer software. That growth is very important to Australia's development as a competitive international economy and should be welcomed very strongly. A large part of the growth in employment will have to occur in the public sector as well. Before I discuss that, I note that there are a number of things that the government can do to enhance employment growth prospects in the private sector, of which perhaps the most important is ensuring that interest rates are as low as possible so that funds can be borrowed for expansion at as low a cost as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also of vital importance is the availability of funds. A major problem that many small businesses have had in recent years is getting access to funds when they do not have physical assets to mortgage against additional borrowings. That is a very common problem in the computer software area. What those companies have to offer is the technical expertise of their staff. It is vital for Australian development that banks and other lending institutions take account of the expertise and the order books of small and medium businesses when considering whether to increase overdrafts or make other lending arrangements. So those are two areas where the government has been active in trying to create a facilitating environment for private sector growth and development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also true that a large part of the employment growth will have to occur in community services; in human services; in large employing areas such as education and health; in police services; in care for the aged, the young and the disabled; in library services; in the arts; and in the environment&mdash;those areas which do most to improve the quality of life. We have tended to forget that one of the observed tendencies of economies as they develop is that, as incomes rise, people want to spend an increasing proportion of their incomes on human services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When people feel more economically secure, they are able to spend more time on education and to afford better education for their children. As incomes rise, and as the population ages, the proportion of income which people want to spend on health tends to increase. As incomes rise and people's opportunity for leisure grows, the proportion of their income that they want to spend on cultural activities, leisure activities, sport and recreation, and preserving and enhancing the environment tends to increase as well. Therefore, governments must recognise that there is community support and demand for increased opportunities in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many areas of Australian society, there is a much higher demand for the kinds of services I have just mentioned than is currently being met. A particularly good example is the applications for technical and further education. At the beginning of last year, about 150,000 more applications were received for places in TAFE colleges&mdash;institutes of technology&mdash;than were able to be provided. That means that 150,000 people&mdash;mostly young, but some older&mdash;were not able to be given the access to opportunities for post-secondary education which would have increased their skills generally in ways of great value not only to them but also to the whole economy. So their life chances were restricted. That is a tragedy. There has been very little publicity or public discussion about it, although there has been quite a lot of public discussion about the greater demand for university places than is available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be a good thing if university places could be expanded even further. Of course, the number has grown strongly in the last 10 years. The number of students at universities has gone up from something like 350,000 about 10 years ago to 550,000 now, which is very strong growth indeed. The same growth has not occurred in the technical and further education area. With an increase in the proportion of students finishing secondary school&mdash;close to 75 per cent of all students who enter primary school complete year 12&mdash;there has been an explosion in the number of people wanting to go on to further education, either of a post-secondary technical kind or of a tertiary kind, yet those opportunities have not been increased sufficiently to meet that demand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those places were being provided, not only would 150,000 fewer people be unemployed, because they would be in training; there would be many more opportunities, perhaps in the region of 10,000, for teachers, lab staff, administrative staff, and construction workers building new buildings. There would be a whole panoply of people providing those sorts of educational opportunities. I particularly mention that because it seems to me to be an enormously high priority. The same kinds of points can be made about other parts of the education system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present in various states we have the tragedy of cutbacks in the number of people employed in primary and secondary education. What the Victorian government is doing is extraordinarily destructive to the quality of the public education services available in that state. This comes at a time when we should be trying to build up opportunities for teachers and support staff and to improve the quality of our education system so that we can have an outstanding and excellent education system rather than a minimal one. So, perversely, the Victorian government is going in exactly the reverse direction to that which this country should be going in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not dissimilar points can be made about health services. The government has quite rightly aimed to improve the efficiency with which health services are delivered. There are very difficult questions about how to do that. How much do we spend on extraordinarily costly high technology health equipment, for example? What level of staffing do we provide in hospitals and health centres for the general public? They are very difficult technical, professional and ethical issues, but I think we have neglected the point that as incomes rise and as the population ages, the proportion of income which people want to spend on health tends to go up. We have tended to say that, while we are spending about eight per cent of our national income on health services, that should set a limit. But we could argue quite responsibly that it would be very natural and proper if that proportion rose slowly and gradually over time, particularly because of the ageing of the population and also because people want an excellent, high quality health service. That requires the provision of additional resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same kinds of points can be made about quite different areas of our life. They can be made about services for families. One of the real tragedies of our society at present is that we are spending so little on conflict resolution within families. We are spending about $20 million on marriage counselling at present. A committee of this House has recently recommended that that be quite sharply increased&mdash;a recommendation that I strongly support. It seems to me that the enormity of the cost of family breakdown in Australia is not being matched by the kinds of services that should be provided freely to families that are in conflict. We all know that such conflict is very common and natural. So that is another very high priority area. That would also contribute to reducing the terrible incidence of domestic violence and violence against children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A quite different area, just to mention another, is the arts. We are a society that is putting quite high value on cultural development. We cannot do that if the arts are underfunded. Our principal cultural organisation, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, has had its funding reduced by about a third as a proportion of national income over the last seven or eight years. That is a very dramatic reduction in its funding. There is a large proportion of the population who listen to or watch the ABC and who would like to see that trend reversed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same could also be argued for the environment. The environment committee which I chair made a recommendation about a year ago for an extension in the system of protected areas to ensure that all major Australian ecosystems were adequately represented in protected areas and therefore that their future was protected. That requires additional funding. The management of those areas will generate additional employment. That overlaps again with the point I mentioned right at the beginning of my speech about the growth of tourism. One of the strongest growing areas of tourism is ecotourism, people wanting to visit and study the natural environment. There is a lot that could be done to improve opportunities for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all those kinds of reasons that are the justification for some kind of jobs levy. We are now the lowest taxed country in the Western world. If we want to increase employment, we will have to allocate some additional resources to that. It seems to me quite natural in this crisis situation we are in&mdash;the worst crisis since the Second World War&mdash;to expect those who are at the upper end of the income scale and who are in secure jobs to make some small additional contribution to providing the resources which would ensure an increase in the number of jobs in high priority areas where improvements in services are desperately needed. That is the purpose which a jobs levy should be put to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many proposals for that. I do not want to go into details. It seems to me to be reasonable and sound to begin a jobs levy at about average weekly earnings, which immediately excludes 57 per cent of all income earners, at one per cent and perhaps move it up to a couple of per cent on higher incomes. A levy of that kind would generate somewhere between $2 billion and $3 billion and those $2 billion or $3 billion could be used for the kinds of permanent improvements in human services for which the community is asking. Provided they were used in those ways, then community support for the levy would, I think, be quite considerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one, of course, likes paying any increased tax, but a temporary modest levy of that kind makes entirely good sense at a time when we are wasting enormous resources through high unemployment. If we could reduce that unemployment in the ways I suggested&mdash;by increasing employment in desperately needed areas&mdash;then that would be of benefit to every person in Australian society. Not only would the quality and accessibility of services be increased, but the compassion, humanity and decency of our society would be improved. I hope and expect that the government will give very serious consideration to this proposal in that kind of context because I am quite sure that there are many people in the community who would like Australia, through this method, to have much lower unemployment and much improved community services. </PARA>

That is not to say that I agree with what he has to say; I very rarely do in terms of his philosophy and ideology. Nevertheless, a point that he made at the start of his speech is very valid. I think in this particular debate a number of people, perhaps on both sides of the House, have exercised undue licence in the subjects that they have canvassed in the context of these appropriation bills. So I agree with the honourable member for Fraser that we need to concentrate a little more on the specifics of the three bills before us and that is what I intend to do in the time allocated to me. Nevertheless, if I get time I will to come back to some of the points that the honourable member for Fraser made and counter some of his arguments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer the House to some specific entries in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) which call for gross additional estimates of about $175 million in the Defence portfolio and specifically $71.7 million for defence housing, reflecting advanced rental payments to the Defence Housing Authority and an additional capital subvention for the Defence Housing Authority. I would like to take just a few minutes of the House's time this morning to say a bit about the Defence Housing Authority. I notice my colleague the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) is in the House. I think what I have to say is something about which he has a lot of knowledge, and I hope he will agree with my comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Defence Housing Authority is one of the rare successes of government business enterprises. It is indeed a major success. The Defence Housing Authority was formed in 1988 under the Defence Housing Authority Act 1987 to take over the responsibility for providing housing for defence personnel from the Department of Defence. Much of the housing that DHA inherited from the department was in poor condition and the systems in place for managing this housing, acquiring new homes and maintaining old ones were patently inefficient and clearly inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The DHA's mission is to provide defence personnel and their families with good housing that is consistent with community standards and that will contribute positively to their quality of life. Thus, while being required to act commercially, the authority has a strong commitment to the welfare of the tenants of its homes. It operates as a landlord, leasing all its homes to the department at market rates. It is up to the department to set rents and to subsidise them, if necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The DHA was established as a commercial enterprise for the purpose of assuming the management of the defence housing stock of 24,000 units located in all states and territories. The authority has a staff of a little over 360, most of whom are located at the housing management centres, which are established close to the areas of defence housing concentration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the mid-1980s, the outstanding features of the defence housing stock were its generally poor quality and, as I said previously, its management. The total stock of defence housing was transferred to the authority at its inception. In the 5 1/2 years of its existence, the authority has provided nearly 12,000 houses to community standards and has disposed of about 10,000 units of unsatisfactory stock. It has instituted a rolling repairs and maintenance program that involves regular consultation with its tenants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arrangements with the Department of Defence enable the authority to apply entrepreneurial approaches to the defence housing requirements while still meeting the needs of the customer. The charging of market based rents to the department has enabled a total transparency in the cost of the defence housing function and has provided the needed discipline for the setting of housing entitlements and deciding the level of subsidised rents charged to Defence Force tenants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The DHA observes commercial accounting practices. Its financial statements provide a full disclosure of the success of its operations and its rate of return on the assets employed. Nevertheless, it has not let its commercial orientation cause it to lose its sense of purpose in providing service families with good housing which will contribute positively to their quality of life and morale, with which I am sure the right honourable member for New England would agree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer specifically to the capital subvention included in Appropriation Bill (No. 3). Special financial arrangements apply to the authority during its first decade of operations. It is exempt from paying taxes or dividends. The government has guaranteed that it will have available $750 million at 1986 base prices in real terms for capital expenditure. In so far as profits and non-cash expenditure fail to provide the needed funds, the DHA receives interest bearing loan subventions from the Department of Defence. In addition, the authority is able to borrow on the private capital market with the approval of the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Major factors in DHA operations have been an extensive involvement in joint operations with the private sector and the renegotiation of a longstanding agreement with the states under which much of the defence housing stock has been leased to the Department of Defence. I draw the attention of the House to the very poor quality of some of that stock when it was passed over and passed back. A lot of Defence Force personnel were expected to live in it for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the funds initially provided to the authority by the government were in the form of loan funds. When the ratios of interest cover and debt to equity fell seriously below prudential financial management levels, $165 million of the authority's debt to the Commonwealth was converted to equity. Departmental subventions to the authority for 1992-93 and 1993-94 comprise 70 per cent equity and 30 per cent debt. But after 1993-94, assistance to the DHA will be only in the form of loans. The resulting capital structure is considered by the DHA to be appropriate to its needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may also borrow from the private sector with the Treasurer's approval. At June 1993, the authority had $331 million in borrowings from the Commonwealth and $209 million from the private sector. A trend towards the private sector is expected over the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Major factors in the DHA's operations to date have been an extensive use of the private sector, which must meet its exacting standards; renegotiation, as I said earlier, of longstanding agreements with the states under which much of the defence housing stock has been released to the Department of Defence from the states; joint ventures with private developers, which are providing an economic supply of serviced lots for the authority's needs; and profits from sales of other lots. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The DHA places much store in continuous consultation and feedback from Defence Force families to ensure that the organisation is responsive to their reasonable requirements. In each full year of its operation, the authority has exceeded the real rate of return of five per cent on assets agreed with the government. Despite targets on the return of those assets having been met, historically the net yield has been too low to attract institutional investors with a view to privatising a significant proportion of the authority's asset base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is little doubt that its successes in the Defence Force housing arena have been a major factor in the retention of service personnel and the maintenance of reasonable levels of morale in the Australian Defence Force. That morale is again being questioned and is under serious risk as a result of other things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Graham, Bill Kirkby-Jones and their team need to take a well-earned bow. I do not want to be too dramatic about it, but it seems to me that at long last they have brought defence housing into the 20th century. I am sure that the right honourable member for New England would agree with me on just about everything I have said. The opposition, therefore, has no objection to the additional estimates sought under the defence portfolio or any additional funding called for under Appropriation Bill (No. 3). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in recent days one little dark cloud has appeared on the horizon in defence expenditure on the new submarine project. The Auditor-General's report No. 22 has been tabled in this parliament. It is currently under review by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, of which I am a member. Therefore, it would be inappropriate for me to go into detail on some of our discussions about that report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there was some mention a couple of weeks ago about question marks over the project, particularly the sudden departure of Dr Don Williams, the managing director of the Australian Submarine Corporation. We have been assured in various quarters that there was nothing untoward about that. Nevertheless, there were a few question marks about some aspects of that project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take the opportunity in this place today to ask the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) to once and for all clear up any possible apprehensions about that project. For a number of us who have been to Adelaide, no-one could be less than impressed with what is being done. However, there are a few question marks, and they have to be settled. The man with the responsibility for doing that happens to be the Minister for Defence. In the context of this debate, I say to Senator Ray that he should let the public know quite clearly and quickly whether that project has any question marks about it and whether he is satisfied with it from an accountability and operational point of view. He should do that as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to Appropriation Bill (No 4). It covers a multitude of sins&mdash;if that is the right wording&mdash;some of which I will quickly run through. The first one is in relation to a capital grant of $50 million to New South Wales for infrastructure enhancements at Homebush Bay for the 2000 Olympics. I do not think any reasonable person would have any objection to that. I think it would have unanimous support of this House and of this parliament to make sure that that happens and happens quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second refers to a little over $25 million which is involved in the Midford Paramount case. This has been canvassed in this place before but I would just add a comment that it is indeed one of the largest scandals that we have seen for a long time. It has been acknowledged in this place at ministerial level; it is now is acknowledged financially in terms of compensation with the heavy hand of the customs service involving financial ruin and broken health for a number of the principals involved in that particular case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point is in relation to a little over $20 million, which is additional funding under the rural adjustment scheme. The rural adjustment scheme is something that we should have. Unfortunately, a lot of constituents in my electorate have had to draw on that scheme, not to keep them on the farm but, regrettably, to take them off the farm. That is one of the disappointments of the scheme in that it seems to give too much emphasis on taking people off the land rather than giving them the wherewithal to stay on farm. Whilst we support that $20 million, we need to be assured that it will be $20 million well spent under a scheme which has a lot of question marks over it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point is in relation to the little over $14 million for health initiatives, particularly for elective surgery waiting time reductions. I will give the House a little anecdotal example, which I hope the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) will take on board, of the problems that people have with elective surgery. A couple of weeks ago a gentleman came to my office and said that he had been looked at by a doctor in October 1991 for some sort of growth on the back of his knee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By November 1993, two years later, he had got to the point where the doctor had decided that perhaps he had better have an operation. He was admitted on Monday 14 February to Toowoomba base hospital. He was prepped for the operation the following day and, of course, was not fed because of the operation. At 4 o'clock that afternoon he was informed, `Well, the operation is off. We have run out of time'. He said, `Well, what time tomorrow?'. The response from the registrar was, `We think we might be able to do it in two months'. That is indicative of what is happening in the elective surgery area with some of these waiting times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another local example was somebody who went in to have a pterygium removed from the eye at one of the surgicentres in the area. He was in in the morning, had it done and was out in the afternoon, whereas the waiting time at Toowoomba base hospital was 21 months. So do not let the government tell anybody that there is nothing wrong with the health system, because there is, and hopefully Senator Richardson will do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth area in this bill relates to $7 million for bushfire assistance to New South Wales. Having visited, with a number of my colleagues, the bushfire scenes recently in New South Wales I believe that, again, no reasonable person should argue against reasonable payment to the New South Wales government for what was a very large catastrophe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the bill allocates a little over $7 million to ATSIC for the preparation and presentation of native title claims. A number of my colleagues have canvassed that this morning. I do not want to go into any detail. I do not have time other than to say that the native title legislation goes far beyond the Mabo judgment. This government has still not answered how much is going to be in that compensation fund and who is going to administer it. To be cynical about it, I think that that legislation will put more children of lawyers and solicitors through private schools over the next decade than we can poke a stick at&mdash;but perhaps I am being cynical. Nevertheless, there is deep concern out there about the degree to which that native title legislation may be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I will cover a few of the points that the honourable member for Fraser made in his remarks. He talked about unemployment being a major factor. I think we would all agree with that. He made the point about the government having some confidence in strong economic growth and a low CPI number. I would make four points that the honourable member cannot get away from: firstly, over one in 10 of our work force are unemployed; secondly, in the last three years the number of long-term unemployed has gone through the roof. I think the figures used in the House in the last week were that about one-third of those who are unemployed are now long-term unemployed. The third point is that, whilst unemployment is a catastrophe and a scandal, we should be looking at underemployment where arguably 18 per cent to 19 per cent of the work force are underemployed; in other words, working less than 20 hours a week. That should say something about the inadequacies of our economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, if we continue to go down the trading black hole, we will be going at the rate of over $1 billion per month. I do not see how the honourable member for Fraser could stand up and argue for a jobs levy. It is not the solution. It will simply cost more jobs&mdash;indeed, the bottom line of his argument is that unemployment is the major factor that has to be addressed. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give the House a little bit of background. The dam was built in 1936 in order to supply water to the tin mine at Derby. Many people throughout Australia have heard of the tin mine at Derby in north-eastern Tasmania. This particular project has become a very dear to my heart project because my father was actually part of the construction team which built that dam in 1936. He was a carpenter. This was actually the subject of a speech that I gave when I was a member of the Jaycees in Tasmania. A couple of gentlemen who were part of that construction team were lost in an aircraft crash in the Glasshouse Mountains in Queensland. A heroic venture for one of those pilots was to save his mate under dire circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular dam originally had rather a nice name, the Morning Star Dam. It is about 250 metres in length and covers an area of 21 hectares. It is 16 metres high at its tallest point. Perhaps in today's context it is not a huge dam but it is a very important dam to that area. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">North Eastern Advertiser</EMPHASIS> of Thursday 27 January highlights the current plight of this particular piece of history. The article states:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Gray, the Minister for Primary Industry and Fisheries, claims that the dam has become a safety hazard, and he has accepted advice that the cost of rehabilitating the dam far outweighs the benefits which the community might receive from the dam's reconstruction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This decision is akin to using a sledge hammer to crack an egg.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party promised to look at recommissioning the Mt Paris dam prior to the last State election, but appears that advice from bureaucrats has overridden any consideration for the community of the North-East.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Primary Industry and Fisheries report commissioned by the Government claims that providing farmers on the Winnaleah Irrigation Scheme with additional water is an unacceptable burden on taxpayers who would ultimately pay the cost of rehabilitating the dam. But who paid the cost of building the Craigbourne Dam in the South-East which directly benefits only farmers in that district?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite apart from the missed opportunities in terms of improved agricultural practice by this decision, the tourism implications have been apparently totally ignored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another government agency (i.e. Tourism) has been active in suggesting how the township of Derby could be marketed as a tourist destination and issues such as the town's historic character and mining history were promoted as worthy of further consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, this issue may unite opposing factions in Derby who are presently struggling to agree on appropriate development for their township.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely the Mt Paris dam is a unique part of that area's heritage?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recreational possibilities inherent in a rebuilt dam&mdash;fishing and associated aquatic pursuits&mdash;are other issues which have not been examined in any depth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A mere $80,000 has been set aside (including $10,000 specifically allocated for the archaeological investigation and report) for the proposed demolition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thus far no information has been forthcoming about where the thousands of tonnes of concrete are to be dumped. Is the structure simply going to be destroyed and left as an eyesore?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Private mining companies are compelled to make good their mess. Government initiated works should meet the same obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision is a short sighted one lacking in any direct or meaningful consultation with the community, particularly the township of Derby, or other government departments which have an obvious role to play in such a decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the dam is demolished, it is no more and the North-Eastern Advertiser believes that more consideration should be given to such a decision which will automatically terminate all options mentioned above.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the tourism potential of this region is enormous, and it is via appropriation bills that we can instigate these sorts of things. North-eastern Tasmania has a long history of pioneering, mining and development. Many of the old mine sites in the area are at present being reopened, either to be reworked or to be used as tourist destinations. The Mount Paris dam is part of this development heritage. It is part of the ethos and mystique of the entire region. It does have structural problems; that is true. But to destroy it, simply throws the baby out with the bathwater. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also pleased to say that, due to the huge public outcry, the Tasmanian state Liberal government seems to have softened its approach to the total demolition of the dam:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The State Government is examining its options to make the historic Mt Paris Dam in North-East Tasmania safe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Energy Minister, Mr Gray, told Parliament that the Government would do everything possible to preserve the historic aspects of the dam. However, he said that all options involved `some demolition' of the dam.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Gray said that a report on the condition of the dam had confirmed that it was a danger to `people and property'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He said that the options included lowering the level of the spillway, a bypass to divert riverflow, reopening the tunnel under the dam to double exit capacity, clearing the timber out of the dam, or a metal structure to prevent blockage.</PARA>
<PARA>So let us analyse exactly what has happened today. Firstly, this is a landmark of historic significance and tourism importance. Secondly, after repair it could become a working tourist attraction, increasing also the water storage available to the Winnaleah irrigation scheme. Thirdly, the state Liberals at the last election gave an undertaking to recommission the dam for exactly that reason. Fourthly, this was the reason that many people in the area voted Liberal at the last election. Fifthly, public opinion in the entire region is incredibly supportive of the retention of this landmark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As I have already mentioned, it now seems that the state government has softened its approach to this issue and I am very pleased about that. But the issue should never have arisen. Surely if Tasmanians are serious about fostering the major growth industry of their state, namely tourism, the state government should never have contemplated the destruction of the Mount Paris dam. Public opinion will ensure that this does not happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at this situation in terms of the federal government's national tourism strategy and how the Mount Paris dam fits that strategy. The Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) made a statement in the introduction to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National tourist strategy information progress report No. 1</EMPHASIS> which highlights this situation. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tourism is one of the few industries in the world economy that has continued to prosper through a global down turn. The ongoing strength of the Australian tourism industry is of major importance to the future of the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tourism growth means export dollars and jobs for Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>I have heard in this place today that jobs are of the upmost importance to both sides of this House. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important that we do not squander the opportunities the industry provides for economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA>That was a very appropriate statement. It is incredibly important that we do not squander tourism opportunities no matter where they lie. The destruction of the Mount Paris dam would be a squandered opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat: public opinion in north-east Tasmania will not allow this to happen. I commend the people of north-east Tasmania for their strength of will in this matter. It is a very small community. I also commend the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">North Eastern Advertiser</EMPHASIS> for the way in which it has reported this situation. It is through appropriation bills that we can ensure that these sorts of projects are funded, the future of this country is looked after and the future employees and job seekers of this country have somewhere to go. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having been in the federal parliament for some considerable time, I have spoken on the appropriation bills on a number of occasions. For a number of years I have studied government legislation and the effect it has on our society. It has always appeared to me that in relation to our basic unit of society, that is our family group, we have always been sadly wanting and, instead of being on the front foot and trying to keep that cornerstone of the nation together, we are always trying to catch up by way of welfare payments for mistakes that have been made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the International Year of the Family we have the opportunity to do something to try to remedy this situation. There seems to be some conflict today as to what constitutes a family. While some pressure groups will try to tell us something else, it is my belief, and the figures show, that most families in Australia today still consist of a mother, a father and children, and most Australians still aspire to that situation. That is not to say that other structures do not exist but, however they exist, it is to be hoped that their main role is one of nurturing the children born into that structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore important that we do all in our power to keep our family structures healthy and together because of the trauma caused to the people involved in separation, and particularly to the children. From an economic point of view, in 1985 these breakdowns cost the Australian nation $1.9 billion per annum. In less than 10 years the cost has trebled and we now spend the equivalent of three new parliament houses every year on divorce and its consequences. The real tragedy is that we spend about 1c for each Australian per year in counselling and trying to keep families together whereas we spend $175 per Australian per year aiding the breakdown and, if you like, the splitting of the loot and the children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know there are many reasons why families break down and I do not think it is up to anyone to point the finger in this regard because many of us, if we have not been separated ourselves, have witnessed the breakdown of the families of relatives, loved ones and friends. While there are many causes for these breakdowns, from my own experience as a father and breadwinner in always a single-income family and from my observations as a parliamentarian, one of the greatest pressures on families has to be finance&mdash;or the lack of it. From the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures for June 1992 we find that there are approximately 4 1/2 million families in Australia. Of these 412,000 are one-parent families. Of these one-parent families 48,500 have a male parent and 363,600 have a female parent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we do as a parliament to overcome this situation of family breakdown and what do we do to try to keep families together? Firstly, we have a government that brags that over the past several years we have experienced one of the lowest growth rates in real wages. The government really does have to get its act together and implement real micro-economic reform, particularly in the area of industrial relations, so that where employees and employers wish to enter contracts that result in higher earning capacity they are able to do so, if not for the economy then certainly for those families who depend on that income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, we have to look at the way welfare is paid in this country and the disincentive this provides for the work force. It is my belief that we must lift the profile and the standing of the family in our society as the most important vehicle by which our children can be nurtured. It appears to me that, whether by desire or by default of the population at large, the family has been taken over by the government and the government now plays the role of child carer in many instances. I believe the importance of the role of those parents, whether mother or father, who choose to stay at home to nurture and care for their children while the other parent acts as breadwinner should be noted and given kudos wherever possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, I believe that financial structures should be put in place to enable some assistance to be given to parents with children so as to allow one partner to remain at the home and care for the children, particularly in their formative years. This is not to say that a parent must remain at home, but in the case of women, in particular, it would at least give them a choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we have to look at the welfare system now obtaining, and the figures I quote are from a recent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> by Alan Tapper. If we look at equivalent final income figures, contrary to the popular welfarist belief, government trends have brought about something close to financial equality between married couples with children and sole parents on pensions. This is taking into account the value of all taxes and all government social services in education, health and housing. The figures show that sole parents and working married parents stand to gain very little from their part-time and full-time employment compared with pension payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate a woman phoned me in tears and said, `Mr Hicks, my husband and I can no longer support our children. My husband is the single income earner on an average wage. We have studied the situation and believe that if we separate we would be far better off economically.' I said, `I find this hard to believe'. She said, `I will send you a letter and let you know all my outgoings and my income'. She sent me those figures and, even taking into account the fact that she smokes and the cost of the cigarettes, she would be far better off separating from her husband. That is a terrible situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures actually show that sole parents and working married parents stand to gain very little from their part-time and full-time employment compared with pension payments. Without going into the detail of the situation, the figures show that the bottom 40 per cent of two-parent families earning an income would be as well off or better off financially if they separated and accepted social security benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1988-89, on average, sole-parent families were subsidised by $11,648. Sole-parent families for whom the pension was their principal source of income were subsidised by $18,096. Two parent families by contrast were average net losers from all government transfers by $3,224. Two-parent families for whom earnings were their primary income were debited $5,096. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my own experience years ago I found that a single income earner in a family, with a husband and wife living together, was certainly behind the eight ball. I think the situation has got worse. Working, married or de facto parents contemplating separation, and life for one on the pension, stand to gain from government a social wage of about $15,650, or about $18,500 in today's terms. Since the average duration on the sole parent pension is 3.3 years, couples who have separated are subsidised by more than $61,000. The only difference between married couples staying together and separating&mdash;while both are alive and still supporting children&mdash;is that they are not living together. Yet couples who have separated are subsidised by $61,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most sole parents on the pension&mdash;about 80 per cent&mdash;are separated, divorced or have left a de facto relationship. Contrary to popular belief unmarried mothers make up only about 17 per cent of sole pension recipients, and three per cent of recipients of sole parents pensions are widows. In effect, about 97 per cent of sole parent pensioner families are families with children which, as I said before, in fact have two living parents. The introduction of the child support scheme may have reduced this subsidy a little, although evidence that it has done so is not yet apparent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, the sole parent pension goes to 300,000 recipients with 500,000&mdash;half a million&mdash;children. This is at a cost of $3 billion per year, and the trend is currently rising at an annual rate of 7 per cent. But we still have not discovered a rationale for that. While I agree that these people, particularly the children, have to be supported&mdash;there is no doubt about that&mdash;I think there is something terribly wrong when, because of government support, it is economically better today to be separated than it is to be married. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AH4">Mr HICKS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member says, it is a ridiculous situation. We have to look at ways in which we can overcome these problems. A number of suggestions have been put forward. Let us first of all look at a suggestion put forward relating to family unit taxation, which is the French system. Under this system, each adult is regarded as a unit and children as half a unit and, if elderly people are supported in an extended family, they are also regarded as half a unit. Today, a single income family on $30,000 pays $18.40 a week more tax than a two-income family on the same family income. We can see there is definite bias against the single income family. The single income family on $40,000 pays $39.30 a week more tax than a comparable two-income family. A single income family on $50,000 pays $67.98 a week more tax than an equivalent two-income family. These figures were calculated on the tax rates effective from November 1993. So we can see there is a definite bias against the single income family compared with a two-income family. I am suggesting that one thing we look at is this unit system of taxation such as the French have. I am not saying that is the answer but it is one thing to look at.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another suggestion, of course, is the income splitting scheme. I know that there have been some criticisms of that simply because it appears that those on higher incomes stand to gain more than those on lower incomes. But, surely, there must be some way of overcoming that situation. Where there is a will there is a way if we are going to try to keep these families healthy and together and provide them with an income that maintains a certain standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other suggestion that is being mooted at the moment is a payment to the person who decides to stay at home and care for the child. It seems to me that we are spending a lot of money right around the nation on child care, and I think the best child care available is when one of the parents looks after the child. It seems to me that, in the Year of the Family, we have to do a great deal to try to overcome the situation in which we find ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment benefit is another issue I will look at. Whilst I was campaigning during the election, I went into a business house. The gentleman there told me that he and his wife were in business and that they took out $200 per week from the business, and no doubt there were other benefits also. They said that they tried to get someone to work for them because they had to provide a service. The business was not going really well but they decided to put someone on. Eventually, they interviewed a gentleman who had four children. This gentleman's story was that he had been in partnership, had broken the partnership and been touring around Australia for a year, had been unemployed for a year, and had then decided to get back into the work force, so he sought this job. When the person offered him a wage, which I think was $100 over the award, the gentleman looking for the job laughed at him and said, `This is ridiculous. I can be unemployed and get $20 less a week than you are going to pay me for working'. He decided that he would stay on unemployment benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that that is another situation in which we have to look at where we are going. Certainly those people unemployed have to be cared for and they have to get a wage that will keep them out of poverty but, by the same token, we must make sure that those people who want to work are given some incentive to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am proud to be a member of the Lyons Forum. It is a group of coalition members who got together&mdash;before the Year of the Family&mdash;because they believe, like I do, that the issue of the family has to be looked at. We have to look at all legislation going through the parliament to make sure that it is not detrimental to the family and, if there is any way that we can have an influence in changing policy&mdash;either in the coalition or in the parliament&mdash;we have to try to do something to make sure that families are cared for. As Dame Enid Lyons&mdash;who is the person upon which we based the name of the organisation&mdash;says, the foundation of a nation's greatness is in the homes of its people. We firmly believe this and we believe that in the past several years families have been going backwards and that we have to try to do something to keep them together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sad thing&mdash;and I was very surprised at this&mdash;is that we are seen as an extreme right-wing group and all sorts of accusations have been levelled at us. I am a parent of four children and a grandparent of six now&mdash;thank God&mdash;and, from my own experience and from the experience of my children and now my grandchildren, I see the problems they face in our society and the attacks that are being made on the family. I think we really have to have something to strive for&mdash;something to aim at&mdash;to try to overcome these problems. I think that if the cornerstone of our nation is attacked then our whole nation is attacked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am proud to belong to the Lyons Forum. We are going to have a look at legislation and investigate what we believe are ways we can help families in Australia and then put them to our parties and to the parliament. It is not an anti-Hewson measure, as some papers have stated, or a pro-anything else; it is just a group of people who are concerned. I ask the media in Australia not to attack us but, if they want to find out something about us, to approach us to find out what we are trying to do, and then to try to assist us if they believe what we are doing is right for families throughout Australia. We do not have closed minds, we have very open minds and we are a cross-section of the parliament trying to find out how we can help families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the House for its time. In the appropriations debate today, I think it is fitting to speak of Australian families; where we want them to go and what we want to do for them. I ask every honourable member of this parliament to think seriously about the family situation. We are all in different situations. Whether we are divorced, separated or married&mdash;whatever the situation is&mdash;I believe the main aim is the nurturing of our children. Having come from a dysfunctional family&mdash;and I know there are other honourable members of the parliament who have been through this&mdash;I can tell the House that a person never gets over the scars this leaves. Whatever we do, we have to try to keep our families together. If we cannot keep them together, we must try to do something to look after the children, in particular, because they are the future of this nation. I ask honourable members of the Australian parliament to keep this in mind and, in whatever legislation they are putting through the parliament, to keep the welfare of the children and the families of this nation well to the fore. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not actually intend to speak on this topic but I would like to make a couple of comments on the observations on the family issue made by the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Hicks). I commend him for the suggestion that, particularly in the International Year of the Family, these things ought to be thought of broadly and in a bipartisan way. I agree completely with the honourable member that it is useless for members of the Australian parliament or anybody else to try to define what ought to be the ideal family situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my speech on this topic on Australia Day I focused on what I think ought to be our three national priorities. Firstly, homelessness just cannot be allowed to exist in Australian society. It is just not acceptable that people should be left out there without friends, family or someone in their support base. Homelessness has to be a target. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I believe that keeping our young people in touch with our older people in some way or other has to be a necessary process for the ongoing nurturing of a nation and its culture. If the young are mixing with the old, then something in the middle must be working. That is the way I look at it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, violence should not be accepted in any part of our Australian culture. To the extent that domestic violence and child abuse&mdash;those issues that occur in Australian families; as the honourable member says, many of us have experienced dysfunctional family situations&mdash;exist in our society, we should make every effort we can to reduce them. To my mind, that is the trifecta: homelessness, keeping the young in touch with the old and working to resolve peacefully difficulties between people. So I certainly join in the spirit of the honourable member's contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a much less bipartisan way, I turn to the topic that I intended to talk about&mdash;road funding&mdash;and, Mr Deputy Speaker Reid, as the honourable member for Bendigo, this would be very close to your heart. We have adjoining electorates and through the centre of our electorates is the Calder Highway. A very interesting situation has arisen in federal and state road funding relationships. I want to talk particularly about a declaration made by the Victorian Minister for Roads and Ports yesterday which illustrates&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Crosio), who is at the table, will well understand the issue&mdash;the problem we face in the federal government in untying funds, giving the states more responsibility in the form that they ask for and then getting kicked in the backside for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The states asked us to untie road funds, to just give them the money without strings attached, and let them spend it where they want. We did that as part of the emerging federal-state relationship through the Special Premiers Conference. In Victoria, that meant about $100 million a year in funds that would have been dedicated to roads are now available for the state to do what it likes with them. Had we kept tying the strings, at least $20 million of that money would have been spent on the Calder Highway&mdash;because that was the ratio that the federal government was locking in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday the state roads minister wandered into the heart of my electorate and announced&mdash;I read from his press release&mdash;very graciously that he had decided to spend some of the money that we had handed to him on the Calder Highway. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the State Government had moved to complete this major road project after the Federal Labor Government had irresponsibly abandoned its commitment to funding these roadworks . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say that motorists are being ripped off and all that kind of stuff. Right through the press release he talks about us&mdash;because at the state's behest we have untied the funds: we have given them the money and the state is now spending it exactly where we would have spent it&mdash;having walked away from the commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pretty sensitive to this, particularly in my own electorate, as you can well understand, Mr Deputy Speaker, and particularly when the Victorian state government, the Kennett government, made such a play in the run-up to the state election that this was a vital regional highway and it would give it top national priority. In effect, for the last 12 months the states have been negotiating with the federal government that we take over the national highway system and fund it completely and that, for state and regional roads, we give them the money and let them do their own thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria, we have taken over complete funding of the main national highways&mdash;the Hume Highway to Sydney from Melbourne, the Western Highway from Melbourne to Adelaide, the Goulburn Valley Highway from Melbourne through Cobram to Brisbane and the major western ring road linking the Hume Highway and the Western Highway. That was a key part of the agreement. In other words, in return for the federal government taking over full responsibility for the national highways, the state government would take over responsibility for construction of these regional roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I am to be frank about it here in the parliament, there was quite a debate within the government about whether we should agree to this process, because every one of us knew that as soon as we agreed to this the state governments would turn around and start saying, `But you will not spend money on our roads'. The state road ministers are losing the argument against their cabinet colleagues within their own cabinet rooms. The other cabinet ministers are winning the battle and the money is being siphoned off to health, education, police, schools and all the other things that state governments have to use their funds on. Because they have progressively been losing the argument in their own cabinet rooms, they are now turning around and saying that the federal government is walking away from its responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is just politics. The honourable member member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), who is sitting opposite me at the table, has been around a long time and he understands how all these things work&mdash;we all do. At the meeting of the Council of Australian Governments next Friday the states will once again put to the federal government that they want a freeing up of the financial relationships between the states and the federal government. They will want more freedom and more untied funds. All I can say to them is that they had better ring up the Victorian state transport minister and let him know that he is not doing a lot to help the argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As recently as yesterday the concern was raised within the federal government about handing over these funds untied and then finding that the priorities of the national strategies are not being carried through and that, instead, some state minister has his own little feel for what he thinks is important. So the capacity to drive what everybody calls for, national strategies, is handed over in a spirit of cooperation and all of a sudden we find that the states have to be dragged kicking and screaming to produce the dollars for roads that they said before the election they would put at the top of the list. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If state governments want an evolving `mature' relationship with the federal government&mdash;we have certainly shown our willingness to move in this direction&mdash;they have to play the game. I thought I would take just a few minutes in the parliament to make the point that there is a willingness to continue these reform processes in the interest of national coordination of policies and programs but that it has to be borne in mind that it is a two-way game. No doubt, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will find something of interest in that to use in your own pontifications in the seat of Bendigo. I certainly support the bills. I think the direction that we are moving in is important, but in the lead-up to the premiers conference on Friday I signal that it is a two-way game: if the federal government is being asked to play it, the states should play it too. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1993-94 makes provision for additional funds needed to meet extra government expenses which have occurred since the last August budget and which are anticipated over the remainder of this financial year. In the main, the bill appropriates funds for capital works for defence facilities and defence housing. However, in addition, it makes provision for grants to the New South Wales government for infrastructure works at Homebush Bay in anticipation of the Olympic Games, additional funding for the rural adjustment scheme, extra relief for victims of the New South Wales bushfires, additional funding for child-care relief and extra resources for labour market programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tucked away in the depths of this bill is the appropriation of funds to enable the government to make compensation payments to those parties involved in the Midford Paramount case. It is no wonder it is tucked away. The Midford Paramount debacle is one of the worst cases of bureaucratic bungling in this country's history. It is a source of great embarrassment to this government, and well it should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The actions of the Australian Customs Service in this instance had significant repercussions on our relations with the Malaysian government. Putting the Midford Paramount company out of business resulted in the loss of 200 jobs and cost some five people their businesses and their livelihood. The payment of compensation was prompted by the findings of the Joint Standing Committee of Public Accounts. Before I refer to these recommendations in more detail, it is appropriate to revisit the history of the Midford Paramount case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Midford Paramount company was a shirt manufacturing company established in the 1940s. It specialised in the production of school shirts for boys. Midford was a very successful business&mdash;so successful, in fact, that I venture to say that many members of this parliament today wore Midford shirts when they were at school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the early 1970s the Midford company established a factory in Malaysia to manufacture garments primarily for the Australian market; however, some production was destined for the American and European markets. Midford's Malaysian operations became increasingly unprofitable and in the mid-1980s the company decided to restructure that side of its business. Midford subcontracted out its Malaysian operations but retained the corporate identity in that country. In 1987 the Australian Customs Service raided the premises of Midford's customs consultant and subsequently claimed that it had found evidence to suggest that Midford had contrived to avoid duty of around $16,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In late 1987 Midford's Australian operations, both Wollongong and Sydney, were raided by the Australian Customs Service. Officers justified their action on the ground that they believed Midford was systematically undervaluing goods imported from the Malaysian factory. Based on the seized records, officers formed the opinion that Midford had sought to defraud the Commonwealth of some $4.5 million of duty through the invoicing of shirts at 30 per cent below production cost and by manipulating its import quota. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of raiding Midford's factory and administrative offices, eight officers from the Customs Service spent five hours seizing documents relating to Midford's business operations. Officers cleaned out filing cabinets and confiscated box loads of documents, irrespective of whether they related to the importation of shirts or the Malaysian operations. In the process, they intimidated the workers of the factory, most of whom were female and of a non-English speaking background. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Actions of the Australian Customs Service, unfortunately, did not stop there. Another three raids on Midford were carried out with the seizure of 162,000 shirts with a market value of around $1.8 million. Evidence suggests that these raids were timed to have a maximum impact on Midford's business. In early 1988 Midford's import quota was cancelled and in mid-1988 the company was charged under the Crimes Act with conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth. The company's assets, as well as the assets of the directors of the company and their tariff adviser, were all frozen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this bizarre story does not end there. Officers from customs then proceeded to Malaysia to gather further evidence and to support their charges against Midford. Without consulting the Australian High Commission, or any other representative for that matter, the officers visited the factory in Penang where it was believed Midford Malaysia operated. Again they searched the premises and seized documents relating to Midford's operations and again it was done without the appropriate authorisation or proof. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Midford Malaysia took out an injunction seeking the return of seized documents, the officers from customs fled the country. Committal proceedings on the charges laid under the Crimes Act commenced in June 1989. It is interesting to note that this is one of the first cases where the Crimes Act was used rather than the Customs Act, as had been the normal custom. If convicted, the defendants faced sentences of up to 20 years and fines of $20,000 each. Following confirmation of arrangements made between Midford and the Fraser government, the charges were withdrawn. Costs of $365,000 were awarded against the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even then, the Australian Customs Service did not, unfortunately, give up. It investigated the possibility of bringing charges against Midford under the Customs Act 1901. Midford subsequently sought compensation of $9 million for loss of business and income lost from the seized shirts, along with the reinstatement of the quota. Its claim was rejected out of hand. Following protracted negotiations, Midford was eventually allowed to buy back the seized shirts and was allocated a token quota entitlement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The end of this tale is that the combined effect of customs seizures of Midford stock, the withdrawal of quota entitlement and the unrecovered legal expenses incurred by Midford led to the collapse of a successful 40-year-old company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some three years after the final chapter on this saga and following a number of inquiries, the Labor government has finally admitted that it managed this affair very badly. While not apologising, the government has admitted its liability and will pay those involved in this case some $25 million in compensation. This bill makes provision for the payment of that compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the very start, the actions of the Australian Customs Service were based on error and misinformation. Facts were not checked, material was misread, events were misinterpreted, there was a lack of supervision of junior officers and pressure was put on officers to give the prosecutors the information they wanted to hear. Indeed, as I said before, the whole matter was extremely badly handled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these comments were backed by the findings of the Joint Standing Committee of Public Accounts. In fact, the committee's report is one of the most damning indictments of a government ever to be delivered. The findings of the joint committee have more recently been confirmed by the Conroy committee of inquiry into the Australian Customs Service. It is disturbing to note that it found that the attitudes which led to the Midford debacle were entrenched in the Australian Customs Service and that drastic and immediate action was needed. According to the joint public accounts committee, the evidence placed before it indicated that the Australian Customs Service was at best incompetent and at worst deceitful. The report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Planning, management, reporting and accountability were all found to be deficient.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overall, the Reports represented a terrible indictment on the ACS and it is a poor reflection on that organisation that many of the more fundamental matters raised therein needed to be said.</PARA>
<PARA>Some of the blame was placed squarely on the officers of the Australian Customs Service and the web of deceit which they had created to cover their actions. The committee uncovered evidence of serious shortcomings in the investigatory work undertaken by the ACS. It noted that officers all too often misunderstood or misconstrued evidence before them, jumped to insupportable conclusions and ignored or even deliberately suppressed evidence beneficial to explanations provided by those individuals subject to the investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee, and more significantly the magistrate who heard the committal proceedings, noted that bureaucrats often had heard only hearsay evidence and were never in a position to prove the conditions. The magistrate further noted that the officers had misled the prosecution and had selectively provided information to their superiors. Two of the officers departed from their sworn statements in the course of the committal hearings. The joint public accounts committee found a range of inconsistencies in the process of gathering evidence. The committee said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it became evident that the Customs Officers misunderstood or misconstrued the eligibility requirements for the quotas granted to Midford, and that in some cases these basic misconceptions persisted right up to the time the Committee examined the individual Customs witnesses in the latter part of the enquiry.</PARA>
<PARA>Moreover, the committee found that material supplied by customs did not in any way support its actions. The committee itself was drawn into the web of deceit created by the Customs Service. The committee said in its report that it `reached the stage where it could no longer trust the answers provided by witnesses from the ACS'. The committee encountered `an excessive number of inconsistencies, inaccuracies and contradictions' in the evidence given by key witnesses from government agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reading the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, it becomes very clear that the ACS was on a witch-hunt. Indeed, anecdotal evidence suggests that the Customs Service wanted to successfully prosecute a high profile importer under the provisions of the Crimes Act rather than the Customs Act. There is a further suggestion that it was the reason behind the significant publicity given to the raids, laying of charges and subsequent court case. The report of the parliamentary committee states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Midford case arose from a government responsible for enforcing the Customs Act unwarrantedly judging a company as guilty of an offence and subsequently targeting that company.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems that customs had something to prove, but the price of this was the loss of livelihood of five highly respected men and the demise of one of Australia's oldest and most successful clothing companies. The other price of this debacle is one to the taxpayer: some $25 million of taxpayers' money will be spent in getting the Australian Customs Service and the government out of the mess which was, in fact, created by their own inefficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do not get me wrong. We support the payment of compensation in the matter; in fact, we consider that, since this matter has been going on since 1990, it is well overdue. But it is a case of concern that the taxpayer continually has to bail this government out of its mismanagement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also cause for concern that there has not been any attitudinal change in the Customs Service and that, as such, a similar situation could occur again. As far back as 1990 concerns were being expressed about the culture of the Australian Customs Service&mdash;including its apathy, its view that all importers were crooks and its utter determination that fraud is common in the clothing industry. The Customs Officers Association has admitted that the culture of the Australian Customs Service is the core problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most recent report on the Customs Service, released just two weeks ago, confirms that there is a problem of attitude within the service. The report suggests that the culture of the Australian Customs Service would only be revitalised by the injection of new blood, particularly at management level. To this end, it recommended a spill of all senior positions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition wholeheartedly supports this recommendation. I take the opportunity to urge the minister to implement this as a matter of urgency. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Crosio), who is at the table, will no doubt remind me that this has started with the resignation of Comptroller-General, Frank Kelly. I am aware of that, just as she must be aware of my belief that this is simply a token gesture and will do little to fix the ills that plague the Australian Customs Service. </PARA>

Secondly, it must implement the recommendations of both the Midford report and the recent Conroy report to develop a new and better focused Australian Customs Service. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in support of the appropriation bills before the House today. I would like to speak on a number of aspects in relation to this legislation. As has been said earlier today, the legislation covers a range of areas consistent with the government's aims for Australia throughout the recovery process, which is happening at present. I believe that industry needs a lot of encouragement as we forge ahead. We should particularly be helping the unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important of the government's aims is reducing unemployment. Honourable members do not need to be told that, as they have been told it often enough. But it is an important area. The largest challenge we face as a nation is getting the unemployed back into the work force. We need to provide real hope for the unemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed. The green paper, which is on the agenda at the moment, will need to be responded to in a very positive way. My understanding, from the attitudes of my colleagues and government members, is that we can expect a very positive response when the white paper is delivered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Australia need to be assured that the government is doing all it can in getting the unemployed back into the work force. These measures will go some way towards doing that. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has stated on numerous occasions recently that this is properly the major focus of government policy&mdash;and rightly so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Australia need to be assured that the recovery which is under way will not pass the unemployed by and leave them with few job prospects in a time of increasing prosperity for the nation. The appropriation bills before the House are evidence of how seriously this side of politics takes its responsibility to those members of the community who are adversely affected by the recession. In this legislation, provision is made for an additional $49.3 million for labour market programs providing assistance to job seekers and industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to statements emanating from members of the opposition from time to time, these programs do assist in the task of helping people back into employment, back into the work force. They are complementary to the employment growth that is being provided by the recovery, an indication of which was exhibited by the ANZ job ads series in the January monthly economic and social indicators, showing a 34.7 per cent increase in job ads since January 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many advantages in having these labour market programs. In my electorate, I have found that the benefits go beyond just the major stated objectives of providing improved job prospects for those who are in danger of falling out of touch with the labour market. The programs also serve to improve the quality of the labour supply in those training methods. They help in stemming the loss of motivation amongst the unemployed. One of the biggest problems is that, when people are unemployed for long periods, they lose motivation and become very disillusioned&mdash;and understandably so. As members of parliament we should always bear that in mind and be very sympathetic and supportive of these people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People in the community say that the unemployed should have to work for their unemployment benefits. It is not always possible to do that. I think that is kicking the unemployed. They want to get out and get a real job. There is no simple answer to that. We need to train these people and get them into new and innovative work patterns so that they have some dignity. Many views have been expressed by the caucus employment task force, which is co-chaired by the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan) and the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith). I have been fortunate enough to be associated with that committee as well. The suggestions have been very positive and I hope they will be picked up by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some very good examples of the value of the programs which have been referred to can be found in my electorate and, I am sure, in many other electorates and probably in your own, Mr Deputy Speaker. But the concentration on providing practical skills and courses for unemployed youth has seen the establishment and growth of a Skillshare funded unit in my electorate called YUPI&mdash;young unemployed people of Ipswich. It is not to be mixed up with any other yuppie type word. This group runs courses as diverse as catering and fibreglassing for young unemployed people in the region. Importantly, these courses include running businesses in their curriculum&mdash;businesses such as the catering outlet called Tuckerbox and canoe hire at Lake Wivenhoe in the Brisbane Valley, which is now in the electorate of Dickson represented by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch). This year the YUPI program will receive over $400,000 in funding to continue its work. I think it will be money well spent.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8J4">Mr LES SCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the parliamentary secretary at the table states, it is a great program. The executive officer of YUPI is a young man by the name of Paul Pisasale, who is also an alderman on the Ipswich City Council. Paul is an enthusiastic young man who works very hard in helping these young people with his very positive ideas. He is also the chairman of the Ipswich Regional Development Corporation. Paul is the Labor Party candidate standing for the position of mayor of the city of Ipswich in the local government elections to be held on 26 March this year. I am sure he will be extremely successful, given the support and the encouragement he has given many people in the local community. I wish Paul and his team well in the forthcoming elections. The sort of enthusiasm that Paul has been able to generate amongst these young people is very important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other success stories to which I can point. In the 12 months to September 1993, more than 1,600  people in my electorate were assisted by skillshare funding. In addition to this, more than $3 million was spent on very successful programs designed to find employment for Aborigines, Torres Strait Islanders and migrant groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The funding coming from the Office of Labour Market Adjustment, OLMA, has been particularly helpful in my electorate. This funding is designed to minimise the adverse effects of structural change in regional economies by increasing employment, education and training opportunities for unemployed people. This is a very successful program and I hope that, in the government's consideration of the green paper, that program will be enhanced because it has a lot of flexibility&mdash;something which labour market programs need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regional manager of my local DEET office is a chap called John Perry. The officers there work extremely hard in promoting this program and they have a lot of interesting and innovative ideas on the drawing board that will help people in their process of transition from training to work. The DEET officers are working on a very constructive program at the moment. I am sure it will work as they are dedicated to the work they are doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A significant proportion of the OLMA funding is being used to establish some local employment networks, better known as LEN, which are made up of representatives of business and the general community, and are designed to improve communication between the regional office of DEET and the local employers. That communication is very important. Often we hear criticisms that the CES, as an agency of DEET, is not necessarily responding to employers' needs. That is one area on which we need to concentrate. But there are some success stories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year I set up an employment advisory group comprising people from my local community to make a submission to the employment task force which delivered the green paper and also to my caucus committee. Our group got together to talk about and identify the relevant issues. Whilst some problems were identified, many respondents said that a program designed to provide a job seeker with enthusiasm, good presentation, a hunger to work and a good work ethic was the best way to prepare the unemployed for a return to the work force. Several programs run by DEET, such as the community activity program&mdash;which I understand will be enhanced&mdash;jobclub, jobstart and LEAP, have achieved these outcomes in Oxley. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other day in parliament, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) mentioned the enhancement of LEAP. If I recall, he said that another 80 positions had been approved that day. That is a very successful program. The minister made the point that it also encourages people to work in the landcare area. When time has permitted, I have had the opportunity to go out and see a lot of young people working on these projects. They enjoy the work. It is very encouraging for them and they get a lot of support. They really learn a lot about landcare, which is crucial to the protection of our environment. In a lot of ways, that is where we really need to start. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year LEAP taught skills including bush regeneration, plant identification, weed removal, selective tree planting, landscaping and horticulture. In addition, young people were given training in carpentry, the use of chainsaws&mdash;that might be a bit of a problem in some ways, but we do need to use those sorts of tools from time to time&mdash;and trail construction, where trails are put through areas of the bush for people's enjoyment. This program not only provided these young people with skills and improved job prospects but also led to an improvement in their attitudes. One result was the beautification of Denmark Hill Environmental Park, which is a hill in the middle of the city of Ipswich. The Ipswich City Council has established an environmental park there which LEAP was able to use. That is a very positive move. One of the chaps who was supervising this particular program had worked with the council under the jobskills program. He had his training there and then went on to supervise young people under LEAP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appropriations before the House mean that DEET can continue to extend its programs to achieve long-term sustainable employment growth. I again make reference to the OLMA program, of which I am obviously a very keen supporter. OLMA's strategic plan for the Ipswich region aims to create long-term structural change in the regional labour market. By establishing the local employment networks, OLMA aims to develop a series of strategically linked programs that will facilitate change. It will result in growth in employment opportunities through business migration, new business start-ups, growth in existing businesses and growth in training opportunities for the unemployed work force and the future work force. It will increase educational opportunities through increasing the access and relevance of educational options to people, particularly at the post-secondary level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major emphasis in these programs is on improving the connections between the government training providers and local industry. This is a reform that will certainly lead to better provision of services and greater emphasis on the relevance of programs to the needs of industry. There are signs that this process is already paying dividends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned before that sometimes there is good news for the CES and one particularly good piece of news for employment&mdash;we often only hear the downside, but this is a really positive note&mdash;is that the Queensland based retailer Giant Supermarkets Ltd has agreed that the CES can recruit more than 600 staff for the next phase of Giant's major expansion in south-east Queensland. Last week Giant's management stated that it was impressed by the professionalism, cost-effectiveness and relevance of CES services in recruiting more than 300 staff for the company last year. Developments like this are welcome news as they show the commitment of the government to attacking the unemployment problem on all relevant fronts&mdash;both within the ranks of the unemployed and within the government departments and training providers&mdash;and to meeting the needs of industry. I congratulate the CES on its efforts and Giant Supermarkets for taking the initiative to use the CES as a very effective employment agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect of the legislation relates to the additional funding for the defence portfolio, which is also a matter of importance to my electorate. I make particular reference to the $71.7 million sought for defence housing, comprising rental advances and additional capital intervention for the Defence Housing Authority. Last Tuesday I had the pleasure of touring the new Fairview Rise Estate development in my electorate, which is not all that far from where I live. The estate is situated in a suburb called Flinders View, which is some four kilometres from the centre of the city of Ipswich. This development is a joint venture development of the Defence Housing Authority and the Mirvac Group. The composition of the estate is intended to be 50 per cent defence personnel families and 50 per cent civilian families. This is in line with the government's policy of integrating defence personnel into the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most people who are familiar with the facilities that have been `enjoyed'&mdash;I use that word quite advisedly&mdash;by defence families in the past would agree that the current developments in defence housing are a welcome initiative. Fairview Rise, which I will have the great pleasure of opening next month, is set on 50 hectares of bushland and has some six hectares of parkland and five kilometres of running and walking tracks. The government's initiative in providing this improved housing for our defence people has been well received. Some of the housing, particularly in the Amberley area, was not up to scratch. This new development will certainly provide better housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Residents' needs are also catered for in this development by the close proximity of shops, schools and public transport. This will have the effect of reducing the amount of alienation often felt by some defence families and it will encourage settlement by civilian families. The homes being constructed are of a very high standard, and on each home site extensive landscaping work has been completed already. It is an ideal development for the members of my electorate who work at the Royal Australian Air Force base at Amberley&mdash;the home of the F111&mdash;as it is in close proximity to the base. There is a highway just behind the development that runs straight out to the base. Careful planning has allowed for a range of home sizes designed to integrate into the community environment and to avoid the look of sameness that some developments have. I welcome the initiative in the legislation before us today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will finish by talking a little about industry and the need for industry investment. In the paper that I provided to the various working parties on employment strategies, I highlighted the future of superannuation and the expansion in that area. I know there has been some talk about tax measures in recent times. I believe that what industry needs is a major boost and a lot of support. There is no need to be talking about more taxes and things; what industry really wants is to get on with the job now that we have more positive economic times before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The banking sector particularly needs to be more responsive to the needs of industry. Rather than lending to industry in the way the banks want to lend, the banks should be producing some innovative ideas to assist industry instead of, as happens on a lot of occasions, not assisting it. I have often pushed this barrow and I am pushing it again today: we need to look again at how we can best utilise the superannuation funds, because they are poised to grow over the years ahead. Figures from the ABS some time ago showed that in June 1991 assets of superannuation funds and approved deposit funds totalled $135,108 million, an increase of $10,781 million on the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The superannuation funds are now geared to move quite substantially. In fact, by the year 2010 it is expected that there will be $1,400,000 million in superannuation funds. If we could encourage superannuation funds, whether by legislation or by a voluntary process, to put one per cent into an investment pool for industry development, we would have to the tune of $1,351 million available straightaway to assist Australian industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 23 November 1993, the journalist Humphrey McQueen related a story about two young Americans searching for their favourite cheese in downtown Paris. They were not after brie, camembert or roquefort, the types that I am sure adorn the saladas of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on the laminex table in the Lodge. No, our connoisseurs were desperate for a taste of the thin stuff that comes in the plastic wrapper, the stuff that Humphrey McQueen so aptly points out comes from the triumph of supply over demand and the global company over local culture. Although French clocks and antique furniture did not get a run, McQueen went on to praise French taste in a manner which would have pleased our Francophile Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This, however, is where the similarities ended. Far from attacking the French for their recalcitrance a la the Prime Minister at Villers-Bretonneux, McQueen lionised them for resisting GATT. This view has little currency in the federal parliament or the bureaucracy where, unless people adopt the pose of a football coach and rave about the beauty of competition, it is thought that they have just stepped out of the cave. It would seem that the French understand just who the big winners will be under GATT's new world order. In stark contrast with the French, our bureaucrats trip over themselves constructing arguments in defence of opening up our markets to all comers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the world falls apart around us, the Prime Minister and his frontbench inform us that a good set of numbers will be bobbing up any day now. Whereas the French believe they have something worth protecting&mdash;work and culture&mdash;we are more inclined to see ourselves as a dumping ground for overseas goods. All we need to do is push on with enterprise bargaining and labour market programs directed at the so-called unskilled and we will have the most competitive work force in the world, so the argument goes. I think the Prime Minister calls it the engine room of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the while we grapple with a balance of payments crisis and the economic rationalists tell us that those disappearing industries were inefficient and only offered dead-end jobs. If the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) has been quoted accurately in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, even import replacement might no longer be fashionable on the Left. Yet if one were to cast an eye over some of the notables on our import list, it is obvious that a bit of import replacement might not be a bad idea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the year 1992-93, we spent $6 billion on imported road vehicles, $1.4 billion on imported paper and paper pulp, $2.1 billion on imported textiles, yarn and fabrics, $570 million on imported cork and wood, $500 million on imported footwear and $500 million on imported seafood. The list is depressingly endless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With a bit of research and development and attention to quality, which were issues taken up by the honourable member for Melbourne, we might even be able to produce some of these goods ourselves. One of the great ironies in this debate&mdash;as confirmed yesterday in a speech by the shadow minister for finance, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello)&mdash;is that the coalition has failed to learn the lessons of the past decade. The honourable member concluded his speech by telling us that it was a tragedy the government had no idea nor the commitment to see the task through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The usual suspects were rounded up along the way. The left wing of the Labor Party was accused of wanting to pick winners and engage in a spending spree. We were told that the labour market, which I suppose means workers and trade unions, was the major structural impediment to the solving of the unemployment problem. Presumably, what the honourable member for Higgins wants is a version of industrial relations of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), and we all know what that means for working people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And, of course, things would not have been the same without the predictable call for cuts to government outlays. I know that the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) is very fond of that one. Those of us who are unfortunate enough to be living in McCarthyist Victoria under the Kennett regime know what this means for the public sector and for the provision of community services. The great tragedy is that our dependence on foreign capital, a dependence lamented by the honourable member for Higgins, is a product of the very policies his party, the bureaucracy, those perennial grumps McGuiness and Moore, and the rump of Labor Party adore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member, a self-proclaimed dry, might be amused to know that those much respected left-wing economists Frank Stilwell and Ted Wheelright agree that our dependence on foreign capital is a serious problem. The difference of course is that they would do something about it. They would probably re-regulate. He and his party would not, nor would the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan) was not about to let the honourable member get away with such myth making. The coalition policy, or lack of it, and the GST received a mandatory caning. By the end of his speech, I was almost believing it was the coalition and not the ALP which had been in power for the last 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If members of the Australian Labor Party believe there is no connection between government policy and unemployment, or if they think that the rise in participation rates or the alleged lack of skill of some workers explains the levels of unemployment, they must surely have rocks in their heads. Although solving unemployment&mdash;especially now that decisions about the location of capital are more often made in Tokyo, New York, London or Brussels than they are in Australia&mdash;is no easy task, we can do without the myth making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further problem is that it appears we now have an industry minister who thinks it has all been too easy and that regional economics, sectoral planning and an interventionist approach ought to play second fiddle to vague notions of international competitiveness. I ought to take him down to Wills to the seat of the former Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Bob Hawke. He could then see some of the unemployment first hand. There is a very real possibility that we will not have an industry statement at all. Maybe this is the real reason why the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths) is not on the front bench. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This comes in the wake of an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> yesterday which pointed out that the slump in the manufacturing industry in 1991-92 was the biggest since the Australian Bureau of Statistics began collecting data in the area in 1968-69. The Prime Minister can flog the export of elaborately transformed manufactures till the pigs come home and the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) can extol the virtues of a bed-linen led recovery, but it is cold comfort for the unemployed in the former industrial heartlands of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we all know, these very same heartlands became poor cousins to marginals when the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) doled out her money prior to the last general election. As I have said before, so much for social justice in the Labor Party. Labor Party members can justify it on the ground that Labor seats are worse off than Liberals, and that is certainly true, but there are plenty of anomalies in the minister's actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To compensate for its obsequious approach to industry policy the ALP will give us a white paper, a jobs compact and much agonising over a jobs levy, voluntary labour, transitional wages and work for the dole. Some on the Left, fearful that the Kelty plan will be shelved, are renewing their support for a more sophisticated approach to industry development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the co-chairmen of the caucus employment task force, the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) and the honourable member for Lilley, despite the latter's great faith in the ability of Meals on Wheels and voluntary work to overcome some of the problems of unemployment, are worried about what is in the offing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Perth is not too keen on a tax on capital, although it appears that some on the Left are now moving away from a tax on workers to a tax on capital. However, he is at least prepared to argue for an industry policy. Aware that current government purchasing policy is at best a joke and at worst a national disgrace, the honourable member for Perth identifies it as one of the four planks of industry renewal. The question is: is this consistent with the GATT?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 16 December 1993 identified a few possible problems under GATT for interventionist industry policy advocates. There is the partnerships for development scheme in the information and aerospace industries. There are the export enhancement and import credit schemes of the motor vehicle and textile, clothing and footwear industries respectively. There is the factor F scheme for pharmaceuticals and there is the industry development arrangements for telecommunications. They were all identified as some of the measures which could be outlawed under GATT. I am sure the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) would be most unhappy if the factor F scheme were outlawed. We could well be left with nothing but the tiresome rah-rahing that has accompanied all the guff about international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only two weeks ago our GATT masters gave us a pat on the head for our liberalising approach to trade matters before admonishing us for not doing more to reduce tariffs in the automotive and TCF industries. Our anti-dumping legislation, we were told, was harmful to small exporters and our labour market too rigid. We have heard it all before, have we not?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Indonesian ambassador chimed in with the warning that we should resist the temptation to cast off deregulation in the wake of the recession. Given the wage levels of Indonesian workers and the treatment dished out to trade unionists in that country, we all know what the Indonesian authorities mean when they talk of deregulation. It was recorded only too vividly in the papers recently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was quick to confirm its commitment to deregulation. Mr Peter Grey, a senior official with the department, went on to say that Australia did not have strategic industry programs and that transitional protection in the telecommunications industry would be phased out in 1996. He had obviously been well worded up by the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan), who was about to tell the world that Australia would cut its tariffs even further if the rest of the world was willing to do so. Yes, we have heard that one before as well. It is funny, is it not, that immediately after the Wills by-election the Prime Minister, ever keen to score a political point, lampooned the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) over his zero tariff policy? We all remember the days of Captain Zero.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently there have been signs that some in the coalition are finally aware that the Labor Party has pinched the middle ground and that unless the coalition modifies its neoclassical obsessions it will be out of power for another 10 years. Strangely enough, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) has emerged as an unlikely hero here, pointing to the problems of foreign ownership of nationally significant industries such as the media. He is almost a Marxist in Liberal terms. The coalition, however, remains a long way off the main game. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened with interest to the comments of the honourable member for Melbourne this morning. I agree when he says that we should not have a preoccupation with Asia and that if we are really serious about exporting we would have Latin America high on our shopping list. In fact, I made this point on page 66 of the document `New Ways in Wills', which I produced more than a year ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth noting that many exporters who come into my office or whom I have dealings with complain about our preoccupation with Asia. The standard view is that there are similar opportunities in other parts of the world. The Prime Minister only needs to look at the globe. On the issues of clustering of industries, again I agree with the honourable member for Melbourne. On page 23 of the document which I wrote more than 12 months ago I had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite government policies there are strong and productive industrial clusterings within the region. Industrial concentrations such as those of Wills are dismissed as distortions in neo-classical theory. In Wills a reliable industrial workforce has been built up over generations. The skills and work experience of these workers are simply discarded under the policies of the major parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know of the success of the Italian textile industry. Matthews and Weiss in their research into the Italian textile industry pointed to the coexistence of competition with cooperation. They failed to find any Australian equivalent to the Italian general framework of support. Matthews, however, identified similar networkings in a group of small Sydney computer firms. The establishment of regional industry councils would facilitate such programs. If we could move them out of Canberra and get them into the communities, we might have half a chance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where I do not agree with the honourable member for Melbourne, if I understand him correctly, is his dismissive approach to import replacement, government purchasing policy and anti-dumping programs. Nor do I believe that the main game is international competitiveness. He would surely know that, although our TCF industry, for example, is as efficient as the best of those in OECD countries, it does not ensure competitiveness with countries using exploited labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That takes me to the question of dumping. Focusing simply on price is not all there is to the question of dumping. I would argue&mdash;and I am sure the honourable member for Melbourne and those on the Left, if they are still with us,  would agree&mdash;that goods produced under exploitative conditions where, for example, trade unions are banned should be classed as dumped goods. I came face to face with this issue on a recent parliamentary delegation to the Indian subcontinent. It was the issue of child labour and many other aspects of working conditions that were a problem. In fact, the conditions in some of the factories I saw there would not be tolerated in Australia, nor should they be&mdash;except that the Labor Party allows us to compete with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another problem in the approach of the honourable member for Melbourne is that he almost falls into the trap of suggesting that international competitiveness or comparative advantage is static. It is not. There is plenty of evidence to support the proposition that some industries which appear to have no place in the international scheme of things can, with the right policies, become successful. It is recognised by industry that government purchasing policy can have a key role in enabling local companies not only to acquire markets but to develop their skill and expertise in a way which facilitates their move into export markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the problem with our purchasing policy at the present time is that it has no real commitment to, or understanding of, its role in the development of Australian industry. Because of this slap-dash approach and the cultural cringe mentality which dominates the thinking of our purchasers, many Australian companies are losing a great opportunity to take a step forward. I have come across companies in my own electorate that have suffered at the hands of government purchasing policy, or lack of. The joke of course is that most other countries know exactly what the value of smart government purchasing is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of indiscriminate import replacement, a couple of things need to be said to the honourable member for Melbourne. It is foolhardy to believe that one can do everything as efficiently as the next person or the next country. I remember well being in Nepal last year, where a particular minister asked whether there might be some value in the Nepalese breeding Australian types of sheep rather than importing the wool from New Zealand. The honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) thought this was a silly idea and advised the gathering accordingly, saying they should stick to carpet production&mdash;often done by children&mdash;and forget about growing wool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There might be occasions on which efficiency is not the only imperative. For example, why have a car industry if we can import cars more cheaply? Why not give up the car industry? I do not think we would be happy about that. Some would, though; Des Moore would not mind. If you are French, why have cultured cheese when you can have the American transnational form which comes in the plastic wrapper?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So is international competitiveness the main game? Well, yes and no. International competitiveness is a reasonable objective; however, we have to be aware of the costs and we should not be driven by the logic of neoclassical theory. The honourable member for Melbourne dismisses neoclassical theory. However, by casting a shadow over the concept of intervention, he runs the risk of affirming the very logic that dominates neoclassical theory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frank Stilwell in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Accord and Beyond</EMPHASIS> takes up some of these issues. Far from ignoring the questions associated with the internationalising of capital, the likes of Stilwell, Wheelright and the Melbourne journal <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Arena</EMPHASIS>  consistently point to the consequences of our dominance by international capital. This is precisely what Humphrey McQueen is on about with his anecdote about the cheese. I presume the honourable member for Melbourne is not taking a pot shot at Marxism here. Stilwell and Wheelright argued for tighter foreign investment review guidelines, re-regulation and planned or mutually beneficial trade. They do not blush at the mention of the words `interventionist industry policy'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like me, the honourable member for Melbourne represents an area that has been devastated by the free trade policies of the 1980s, policies which have left parts of the region with unemployment rates as high as 20 per cent. The honourable member for Melbourne says we face the risk of returning to the ad hoc policies of the 1970s. Surely the Left is not about to laud the policies of the 1980s, which were pursued without impediment in this place because of the bipartisan nature of support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the honourable member talks about support for programs involving links between industry and research bodies and the clustering of small enterprises, I am in total agreement with him. Unfortunately, there are a few other questions to be answered. I doubt that the honourable member will be able to explain to the people of Brunswick how it is that international competitiveness without sectoral industry policy will bring back jobs to that region. It could easily be argued that the honourable member for Melbourne is falling into the language of the neoclassicists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A former Brunswick resident and Labor Prime Minister, John Curtin, used to talk about public ownership and the public good. All the honourable member for Melbourne can talk about is instinctive interventionism, and even that is dismissed. Strangely enough, this ideology runs counter to the spirit of the Brunswick Council, which has adopted an extremely participatory role in local economic and cultural life. The Brunswick Music Festival, an event sponsored by the council and attracting overseas capital in the form of internationally renowned musicians, is an example of this approach. Culture might be alive; the other parts of the economy have a few problems out our way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The left needs to be reminded that the market and the economy are not outside the community but are things that belong to and should serve the community. The government has a role to play in this. The problem is that I am not sure whether the left understands this. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While those on the other side of the House have been busily self-destructing, the government has continued to pursue policies which have helped to lead Australia out of recession. I can proudly say that those policies of this government have particularly benefited my electorate of Leichhardt in Far North Queensland. The federal government has implemented policies that have ensured the continued growth and economic diversity of the Cairns region. This has necessarily involved focusing on the region's dynamic tourism industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last decade has seen the tourism industry develop into one of Australia's key export dollar earning industries. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be aware that in 1992 the tourism industry generated foreign exchange earnings of $8.2 billion. In 1991-92 the industry contributed around 5.5 per cent to Australia's GDP. There is no doubt that the tourism industry has played a major role in securing the economic future of the Cairns region. The tourism industry provided 25 per cent of the gross regional product of the city of Cairns in 1992, according to the federal government's Industry Commission report on impediments to regional industry adjustment released in September last year. In 1989-90, 18.7 per cent of international inbound passengers arriving in Queensland disembarked in Cairns, in my electorate. In 1980-81 that was a mere 3.7 per cent, so there has been enormous growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A report prepared by the Queensland Government Statistician entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tourism Statistics in Queensland</EMPHASIS>, commissioned by the Queensland Tourism and Travel Corporation, shows that Cairns stands alone as the flagship for inbound international tourism. The report shows that since 1988 inbound international traffic to Cairns has climbed by a massive 228.5 per cent. The federal government can claim a lot of the credit for this remarkable performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As it happens, 1988 was the year of the federal government's successful nomination of the wet tropics rainforest on the World Heritage List. The establishment of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and the world heritage listing of the wet tropics rainforest by the federal government in 1988 have ensured that international tourists know about these two great tourist attractions. That nomination to world heritage listing was opposed to the last dying breath of the National Party government in Queensland, which thankfully was turfed out in late 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor government has further assisted the tourism industry by the timely provision of infrastructure. In the Cairns region, the Civil Aviation Authority has spent $1.1 million on the control tower and associated radar works at the Cairns international airport. The federal government has also committed $50,786,000 to works on the Bruce Highway, including the Babinda bypass. In addition, we have spent over $66 million on the national arterial roads in the Cairns region, plus $2 million in the upgrading of the Daintree to Cape Tribulation road. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Initiatives contained in the 1993 budget will further strengthen the tourism industry in Cairns. For example, in the budget the government announced additional funding of $38 million over four years for overseas marketing and $2 million in 1993-94 towards the establishment of a partnership Australia initiative. More directly relevant to the Cairns region is the federal government's $23 million regional tourism development program. I am confident that a substantial amount of this funding will flow into the far north region of Queensland to develop an integrated regional plan for the tourism industry in the far north. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just this week, the government announced a million-dollar allocation to boost overseas marketing of Australia as a destination for backpackers and budget travellers. This follows a budget allocation of over $4 million over four years to develop backpacker tourism and subsequent industry consultation through the government's backpacker consultative forum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cairns is already, as I think most people in this House would know, an extremely popular backpacker destination. The market is worth about $1.5 billion to the tourism industry and I am confident millions of those dollars come to Cairns. The interesting thing about backpacker tourism is that, though backpackers may not have as much money as other tourists, they certainly spend a greater percentage of their money in the local economy, so it is something that we should encourage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bureau of Tourism Research data shows that in 1992 166,000 international backpackers visited Australia, staying an average of 78 nights, compared to 25 nights for all travellers, and spent an average of $3,267 compared with $1,760 for all visitors. The federal government has recognised the growing contribution of the tourism industry to the economy and has acted to capitalise on that. All the opposition has had to offer the tourism industry was a GST which would have devastated the economy in Far North Queensland. </PARA>

The committee met with representatives from local government, the Cairns Chamber of Commerce, the Confederation of Industry, Cairns Region Group Training, TAFE, Catholic Education, Skillshare and welfare groups. The task force report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Restoring full employment: a discussion paper</EMPHASIS> known as the green paper on unemployment is an excellent starting point to address unemployment in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I especially welcome the task force commitment to consultation, and not just with people in capital cities. The government has put its long-term employment programs on hold while the task force formulates its final position.

This government has committed $4.2 million to the program over four years. Eleven shires in the region are participating in the program, which involves planting rainforests and other timbers on private land as a resource base to the timber industry and hundreds of young people have been employed on the program through the landcare and environment action program. The scheme is also building up a skills base in reafforestation. There is unlimited potential for us to export those skills and to make the Cairns region the world centre for rainforest reafforestation. I was pleased to hear the Minister for Employment, Education and Training inform the House the other day about the allocation of placements for an additional 80 young people in the Far North. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to place on record in this House the fact that unfortunately the Cairns City Council is the only council in the region that has declined to participate in the scheme. I take this opportunity to call on all mayoral candidates and candidates for the council to get on board the CRRP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The green paper on employment opportunities highlighted the potential for additional employment in the environmental sector. Once again, we are leading the way with such programs in the Far North. Mulgrave, Douglas, Mareeba, Herberton, Johnstone, Eacham, Atherton, Cook, Cardwell, Hinchinbrook and Thuringowa shires all participate in the CRRP. The CRRP helps protect the environment by preserving existing forests at the same time as it creates job opportunities for young people who are trained in plantation techniques through the landcare and environmental action program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister visited with me a number of plantation sites around Babinda in January this year. We went with Mr Joe Baker, Chairman of the CRRP management committee, to Errol Wiles's property and the Boulders tropical fruit farm managed by Mr Pedro O'Connor, both near Babinda. I think Errol Wiles would be one of the most enthusiastic supporters of the scheme that one could meet. His vision is to plant his entire property under the program with his main objective being future timber production. Site preparation has been completed and 13 different rainforest species have been planted, including block plantings of hoop pine and teak. Twelve different rainforest species have been planted on five acres of land that was previously used for cane growing at Boulders tropical fruit farm. The bulk of the planting was carried out in February and April 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister was very impressed with the importance and success of the scheme. The idea of young people working on landcare and environment projects makes a lot of sense, especially as those young people have been given work experience that they would not have had. CRRP is an excellent example of what can be achieved when the three tiers of government and the community work together to provide a future for Australia's young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While long-term unemployment is a problem in Cairns, like everywhere else, I am sure the region presented a more positive picture to the Prime Minister's employment task force in terms of jobs growth than perhaps other regions around the country. With a number of big construction projects getting under way this week, the job market in Cairns is set to expand. The residential construction industry alone is presently a $250 million a year industry in production terms. Cairns has the highest urban growth rate of the provincial cities of Queensland. We have been eclipsed in this regard only by the Sunshine Coast and the Gold Coast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sugar industry, of course, is still the major contributor to the far northern economy, and the federal government has committed $20 million over four years, matched by the state government, for sustainable infrastructure projects in the industry. That does not ignore&mdash;and I do not want to ignore&mdash;the mining industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cairns's growing manufacturing and export trade has the advantage of close proximity to South-East Asian and Pacific markets. The federal government's task force on regional development, chaired by Bill Kelty, held public hearings in Cairns in August this year, and the report of the task force highlighted the growth potential of the Cairns region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Kelty report highlighted the long-term transport needs of Far North Queensland and I endorse the report's call for construction of a dual highway from Adelaide to Cairns in the next 30 years. I especially support the recommendation to develop fast train connections between key cities, and I think that this is obviously one of the transport modes of the future. The Kelty report talks about the importance of rail and I would not want to underestimate that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To complement the Kelty report, the McKinsey consultancy on business development in regional areas will also appear.

The study is designed to provide an understanding of the factors driving private sector investment or, conversely, non-investment in the north and the far north, and yet Senator Bishop knocks this. It will target a broad range of business types from retailers to lawyers to those participating in heavy industry. The pretender to John Hewson's throne rejects this consultative approach. I guess the only thing that can be said about Senator Bishop is that perhaps she could be called `she who must be obeyed'. She knows and no-one else can tell her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the sort of rapid growth that we are experiencing in Cairns does have its downside. This Friday the Cairns Mulgrave housing network is holding a workshop on the subject `Tourism and affordable housing do not mix&mdash;or do they?' and of course there is a question mark there. The influx of job seekers to the region puts a lot of pressure on the regional market in Cairns and along the Marlin Coast to Port Douglas. The problem is exacerbated by the holiday rentals in places like Port Douglas, and prices do rise due to any local property boom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the opposition, this government is developing policies to deal with these issues.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make some comments today on these appropriation bills and on the strange speeches that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has been making about the need for micro-economic reform in the states. In judgmental statements over a period since April 1993, the Prime Minister has been holding forth to the states of Australia on the need for them to reform. At no point in any of these presentations has the Prime Minister acknowledged that the Commonwealth government needs to set an example if it expects other governments to follow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister laid down four principles as part of the proposal for the Council of Australian Governments meeting in Hobart next week. Firstly, there should be recognition of the role of the states in the federal system. Secondly, there should be a commitment on both sides&mdash;that is, state and Commonwealth&mdash;to use reforms for their own sake and not as bargaining chips in future negotiations. Thirdly, there should be a willingness to enter into genuine discussions on the roles and responsibilities of the states and the Commonwealth. Fourthly, there should be a blanket refusal by the Commonwealth to entertain any substantial transfer of Commonwealth taxing powers to the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each of those points needs serious investigation. Those points that are proposed as matters for discussion at the Council of Australian Governments in Hobart need close scrutiny by state governments. I have noticed with interest that already the Premier of Western Australia, Mr Richard Court, has condemned the federal government for the way in which it is seeking to make, as he calls it, `a grab for power'. When one examines the principles stated by the Prime Minister, one would have to agree with that observation by the Premier of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When micro-economic reforms were proposed in Victoria by the Kennett government, when the Kennett government moved to recover the disastrous situation left by an incompetent, wasteful and fraudulent state Labor government, they were blocked at every turn by the Prime Minister of Australia who said, `We will not allow the Victorian government to move ahead with its program of micro-economic reform'. What nonsense is it that the Prime Minister is now presenting to the premiers of Australia in claiming that he has a new-found interest in micro-economic reform?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One needs to examine the four points. However, it becomes pretty obvious fairly quickly that while the Prime Minister does mean reform, he means reform for the states but not for his lifestyle, his behaviour, his treatment of the parliament, his treatment of the Australian people, or anything that resembles micro-economic reform. None of those is on the Prime Minister's agenda. The only thing that is on the Prime Minister's agenda is to continue to squeeze the states harder for as much money as he can get out of them for this difficult budget, to squeeze them as hard as he can and to give away as little as he can of his own revenue. He wants to hold it all centrally in Canberra and use it at his whim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recognition of the role of the states in the federal system is the first point. What does that mean? It is a bland statement that means that the states have a role, but if it is Mabo legislation that is being dealt with then they get rolled. It means that anything that the state governments stand for is ignored if it is something that the Prime Minister designates as being of national significance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ministers at this table would not be taking part in these negotiations, but they range across things such as regional development, legal services, workers compensation, electricity charges and the electricity industry, industrial relations, and a whole range of other things that the Prime Minister wants to put on the table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand Premier Court being distressed when contemplating what the Prime Minister has in mind because the fact of the matter is that he has experienced the Prime Minister's regard for state governments, and he does not want any more recognition of his state government's role in the Commonwealth from this Prime Minister, so he rejects quite roundly the first point. I do not know how the other premiers are going to confront this, but I believe that Jeff Kennett would be pretty concerned if he got any more recognition from this federal government as far as industrial relations and the powers of the Victorian government are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's statement proposes that both sides make a commitment to use reforms for their own sake and not as a bargaining chip for future negotiations. In fact, that means that any state government that has made a successful reform cannot hold it up to the federal government and say, `We have been good at what we have done. We are reducing our costs and therefore we need some recognition to be able to keep our state government going'. It means that those who remain inefficient are the ones who will continue to be rewarded and those who have made reforms cannot hold them up for credit at any future meeting of the Council of Australian Governments. So the reforms are entered into for their own sake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also is a process that seeks to protect the Commonwealth government. The Commonwealth government is not going to consider advances made as part of micro-economic reform as laudable or to the advantage of the Australian nation. What the Commonwealth government is saying is that there will be no recognition of reforms and they will not be used as bargaining chips. That means that the Commonwealth government itself need not make reforms. It cannot point to its own example, it cannot say to the state governments, `Why don't you follow the practices we have instigated?'. The fact is that the Prime Minister has no intention of having the Commonwealth as a pacesetter; his total intention is to screw the states as tightly as he can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point made by the Prime Minister in the statement yesterday related to the willingness of the states to enter into genuine discussions on the roles and responsibility of the states and the Commonwealth. I have been reading an interesting article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> by Prudence Anderson, who seems to be a writer for the Prime Minister's office because there is so little analysis of, or critical statement about, the Prime Minister's speech. According to the article, the issue that former Prime Minister Hawke raised of the reduction of duplication in state and Commonwealth services is back on the agenda. But, in this instance, according to Prudence Anderson:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this time around it will be broached as a sectoral exercise to try and clean up functional duplication in the health and community services area.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what it has always been about: the relationship between the Commonwealth and the states on providing community and health services. That was the sticking point under Bob Hawke. It was never possible to get past the point where both Commonwealth and states wanted on the one hand to retain the delivery of services but on the other to dispense with the delivery of services. The cooperation needed to achieve that is massive. Mr Keating is stomping around and saying, `We are going to go back in there where Bob Hawke left off, but this time we are going to get it right. We are not going to be able to use any of the systems that Bob Hawke used, so what we will use'&mdash;he is saying in small type&mdash;`is the power of the purse to achieve these objectives of ours'. That is what it is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth point raised by the Prime Minister for discussions with premiers at the end of the week is a blanket refusal by the Commonwealth to entertain any substantial transfer of Commonwealth taxing powers to the states. There is no responsibility given to the states: make them mendicant dependants upon the largesse of the Commonwealth government, make them prepared to settle for the abuse heaped on to them by the Prime Minister, make them prepared to understand that words like `the Commonwealth was prepared to adequately resource the states' mean what they say. Of course, they do not&mdash;the Prime Minister's words never mean what they say. He has never once in this parliament, or out of it, meant what he said and done it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the Commonwealth cannot in any way bring the states into an area of control except by the power of the purse, and it is no wonder that the state governments are really concerned about what the Prime Minister intends to do at the Council of Australian Governments meeting. His intention is to squeeze the budgets of the states, to allow the Commonwealth budget to continue to grow, and to instigate no micro-economic reform, the sorely needed micro-economic reform that can be given direction and impetus by the Commonwealth. He has refused to do anything about that. One has only got to look at the port strike and what has occurred over the last couple of weeks to see the inadequacy of this government in dealing with any of it. It has not got a plan, it has not got anything. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) says, `Well, I have achieved a lot'. The strike is still on in Sydney. Hooray! He started the process, went through it, everything stopped around Australia and we came back to the stoppage continuing in Sydney. What has been achieved by the Minister for Industrial Relations strutting the stage of Australian politics saying he has fixed things up? That is this government's idea of micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two dominating agenda items for this Council of Australian Governments meeting. The first is the states' demands for an overhaul of federal-state relationships. Yes, that must happen. It has been Keating-speak that has gone on, the screwing down of the states, giving them no responsibility for any area of taxation but doling out money to them as the Commonwealth sees fit, but then not applying any rhyme or reason or judgment as to the way in which those handouts are made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened in the past is that, if it is a Kirner government in trouble or if it is a Bannon government in trouble, there is extra money there. That is the way those decisions are made. It is not a matter of straight economics or efficiency or micro-economic reform, it is a matter of whether one is a mate or not. A state government in the past has received additional funds if it is a mate of the Prime Minister. With the change in the voting pattern around Australia, with only one Labor state left in Australia, it is no wonder the states are saying, `We want to get down to real issues. We've tried to make economic reform, but you want to come in and control the electricity grid or you want to control our industrial relations by writing laws here in the Australian parliament for builders labourers, rather than allow the Victorian government to do it'. That is the sort of control that the Commonwealth wants. It is no wonder that the state governments, headed by Mr Court, want an overhaul of federal-state relationships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The council has another major agenda item that will be considered by the premiers, and that is the Commonwealth's insistence that the states pick up their own performance on micro-economic reform. I have heard the Prime Minister making these statements, and the Prime Minister's judgment is that the states have made no micro-economic reform. In my state of New South Wales there has been reform after reform, consistent changes, and for some time the people of New South Wales have borne those changes and can see the benefits of them. But there is a limit to the patience of the people of New South Wales with the reduction in staff in all types of government agencies and consistent cutting of the budget. However, the one thing that comes through from these processes adopted by New South Wales governments, starting with Nick Greiner, is that New South Wales fared better in the recession than any other state because it was better placed to do so. It did far better than the Commonwealth government, far better than the Victorian or any other government around Australia, because the reforms were started in time, well ahead of any contemplation given to these matters by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has just plucked something out of the air, saying, `This is a way to encourage economic reform&mdash;we will cut state budgets'. The state budgets have been consistently cut for a long period of time in order to force economic reform. It is time that the Commonwealth itself got serious about economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reforms that stands out is the one that the Minister for Industrial Relations and the Prime Minister refused to make to Australia's industrial relations. They are passing legislation through this parliament to make things worse, to tighten union control of the way in which decisions are made between employers and employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I attended a speech given by the Prime Minister on 21 April 1993 to the Institute of Directors in Melbourne. The Prime Minister said in that speech that decisions on wages, working conditions and salaries should be made by the workers themselves, their employer and the union&mdash;a three-way contest. What a strange sense of proportion this Prime Minister has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the same speech, in passing, whilst talking about the way the Commonwealth is so well equipped to establish changes in regional development&mdash;another major so-called proposal for the Council of Australian Governments&mdash;the Prime Minister says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Alan Griffiths, we now have a senior Minister in Cabinet charged with regional development. As a result, the regional dimension of all Government policies will come under constant focus.</PARA>
<PARA>That was some minister! That was some sandwich shop! Where is the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths) today? He could not run a sandwich shop and yet he was being touted by the Prime Minister as being the person most likely to lead Australia into a blinding new future with his attitude to regional development. As the Prime Minister says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Existing programs will be reviewed, including to ensure harmonisation with State programs.</PARA>
<PARA>We had the Kelty report. Mr Kelty wandered around Australia visiting some areas and then presented his report on regional reform. He visited western Sydney for one day. Western Sydney has a population of between one and two million people. Mr Kelty spent one day there. He thought that was enough time to look at that regional area, and then he left. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are huge problems in western Sydney. Last night we heard a major speech from a new member, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), about those problems. Honourable members should understand the problems western Sydney has with its burgeoning population, and yet Mr Kelty and his staff spent only one day there. So this is the brand-new day the Prime Minister is talking about for regional development. The only thing that was proposed for western Sydney that was of any consequence was that the international airport should be pressed on with and that a new freeway should be built. There was very little else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those proposals are very wrong. When it comes to considering the Prime Minister's views on what should be done in micro-economic reform, the whole process is just a blind. What the Prime Minister is endeavouring to do is to cut state budgets and grab more power for Canberra. Not one element of this program needs to go on the agenda for a discussion of this type. All of these programs can simply be effected by the Prime Minister and the Commonwealth government putting into action some of the Prime Minister's rhetoric and applying it to his area of responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The micro-economic reform espoused by the Prime Minister should start at home. It needs to start, firstly, with industrial relations. Then it should cover the management of government resources and government enterprises themselves. The whole process of privatisation has stalled due to union movements which are demanding that the government not proceed. The government itself has been stalled by the Clerical Workers Union on the reform that it is proposing for Australia Post. Outlandish claims have been made by that union, and the government has baulked at going further ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the whole process that government proposes for the Australian states will drag Australia further down. This Prime Minister has no understanding of leading from in front. All he does is manipulate and control and then seize the front-page headline. All he is interested in is whether or not he gets the headlines, whether he gets the front page, whether his words are up front. It means little to him whether there is any progress or advancement or change which is to the benefit of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot think of a more incorrect headline than the one which says `New deal for States in PM's plan'. There is no other headline that I have seen around Australia today which so totally misrepresents the ultimate goal of the Prime Minister than this one, because the Prime Minister's only purpose is to control the states, cut their budgets and grab power for Canberra. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had reason to talk with the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Fahey, the other day and I brought up the matter of main road 92. The response from Mr Fahey was, `Not in our lifetime, son'. Well, I have got news for Mr Fahey. It will happen in our lifetime whether he likes it or not. The point is that he will not be the Premier for much longer and when we get some sense and reality into the picture in New South Wales the state government will see the economic importance to my electorate of main road 92.

They are Labor held and independently held, and for that reason we get the short end of the stick. I will go through this matter further with regard to health, but I can tell Mr Fahey directly that we will get funding for main road 92. By hook or by crook, it will be done.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I now move on to some further instances in relation to fuel prices. For example, I totally support the organisation representing the truck transport industry in its recommendations for diesel pricing, and I will do all that I can to see that its recommendations come to fruition. Another issue is the effect on the maritime industry of the diesel hikes. The Maritime Union of Australia is another great ally of mine, because many of its members live in my area. The Seamen's Union of Australia, now incorporated into the Maritime Union of Australia, went to great lengths with restructuring to change the manning levels of our ships, and to change practices so that its members would get some profitability back into that industry, so that their jobs could be assured in Australia's future. An unfortunate by-product of our fuel price changes is that many of those profits have been swept away by the increases in fuel prices. Because I value my comrades in the Maritime Union of Australia and their contribution to this country, I will do all I can to protect their interests and the interests of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Transport is the main equity issue in my electorate. If one looks at the cohorts of mature Australian women, one finds that many of them, through no fault of their own but through the socialisation that they have experienced in life, have not obtained driver's licences. That may not seem like a great burden, if one lives in one of the major cities with public transport. But if one lives in regional Australia, as I do, where there are vast areas of rural landscape, one has no public transport. We do not have access to public transport. So when dad dies and mum is out there at 65, and she does not have a driver's licence, she is left on her own. That creates a whole range of problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about equity, social justice, access to services, access to work and to community needs, it all comes down to transport because the young people, the unemployed people, in my electorate will all benefit by access to transport.

The state minister, in a very sleazy act, tried to say that the former minister, the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), had promised funding in a pork-barrelling exercise for electrification of the rail link to Bomaderry. That was a complete lie. Linking back to the roads question and Mr Fahey's `never in our lifetime' statement, the former Minister said, `It is back to state priorities'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that the major part of my electorate is held at the state level by Mr Hatton and Mr Harrison, and Mr Fahey actually holds one section of that. Amazingly, those parts of the electorate get a very good deal. Those areas have got their hands in the cookie jar every time. I do not take that away from my people in the top end. I support all the services delivered to them. But what about the people in Kiama and Nowra? What about the people in Ulladulla?

If those people on the other side have the audacity to start talking about pork-barrelling, tell them to have a look at their own governments. Tell them to have a look at Kennett and what he is doing in Victoria and, more to my concern, what Fahey is doing in New South Wales. It is absolutely outrageous what these people are trying to pull off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are talking about is consumer rights issues. The health consumers of my electorate, in the Labor held parts and in the Independent held parts, have got just as much right to services as the people who are in the Liberal sections. Those people should support that, but they do not because they think it is all right as long as they are getting away with it. That is what they are doing. The reality is that my people demand access to bulk-billing and access to 24-hour medical service but they do not get it in significant parts of my electorate. It costs them $32.50 for a consultation. If they have not got the bucks on them, it is $5 extra. And if they cannot guarantee that they will pay, they do not get seen. That is reality. This issue of access to services and to decent hospitals is such that over 7,000 people have signed a petition in Milton-Ulladulla urging updates of that hospital and more facilities for that area. They are going to be laughed at by the state government because they do not happen to be in a Liberal seat. Consumer rights are the issue, and I will stand up for my people.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a related issue, it was brought to my attention recently that in my electorate of Lyne we have an operator who was in partnership with the CSIRO in some research and development project that seemed to come asunder. It has been reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> back in January that, following a lengthy court case between that private company and the CSIRO, the CSIRO paid out an out of court settlement of allegedly almost $10 million. It has also been alleged that there is probably a legal bill that has been underwritten by CSIRO, and ultimately the taxpayers, of a further $10 million.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the appropriation bill there is $20.7 million additional funding for the states under the rural adjustment scheme.

From those bushfires we have seen some of the greatest devastation in New South Wales in the history of this country. We have seen the inadequacy of essential services to mount a decent defence of residential areas&mdash;of life, limb and property&mdash;during those bushfires. The Victorian bushfire brigades that came to the assistance of the bushfire brigades in New South Wales during that time have commented since that they were amazed at the age and the poor condition of the bushfire fighting equipment that is used by bushfire brigades in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An amount of $7.3 million might seem to be a lot of assistance, but it has to go across the board to assist a lot of areas.

We had to borrow aerial firefighting equipment from New Zealand, for goodness sake&mdash;our poor cousins across the Tasman&mdash;to help fight the fires. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is terribly important that, perhaps in the budget this year, we look at the provision of more funding for those essential services, and not just in New South Wales.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I should explain that my department does not actually perform an audit function in relation to any program of government. The department is responsible for providing advice to government at the time new policy proposals are being considered and it will, of course, have comments on programs at that point of time. From time to time, we will have discussions with the Auditor-General on activities that the Auditor-General is interested in. The department has a general responsibility to ensure that there is expenditure against appropriation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it&mdash;I only entered the department recently&mdash;from time to time the department has had concerns with regard to the community cultural, recreation and sporting facilities program. Those concerns have largely revolved around the fact that the program has regularly underspent. The program has regularly underspent because basically one of the checks that are in the system means that until the money is actually spent by the recipient organisation and until there is, if you like, something to show for it at the end of the day, then the money cannot be appropriated. This is why there are no new approvals being given, including in the forward estimates, even though the program has been completed. There is a substantial overhang in subsequent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, the department occasionally expressed concerns about the initial stages well before the current Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories was appointed to that position. But, at the same time, it came to the view that, because of the checks that were put in place, such as the one I referred to, by and large it could proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the daily audit function related to the operation of the grants is not a function that is performed by the Department of Finance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. This very popular decision on the new labelling is going through two stages. The first is an information campaign. I have just sent out an explanation of how the scheme will work to the many thousands of people who inquired after this scheme and put in proposals when we were discussing it with the public. We have distributed thousands of leaflets so far. The response has been extraordinary. We are having to reprint and reprint because so many people are interested in our proposals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few people have criticised the scheme because they would like something added. For instance, people promoting Australian owned products would like us to add to our labelling information whether the product is owned by an Australian company. The scheme sets the baseline. If people want to add that their company is Australian owned they can certainly do that. If the National Food Authority wants to add extra information about food, it can do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic scheme is so simple. We will just have two categories: `Product of Australia' or `Produce of Australia' for all Australian goods and `Made in Australia' for goods made in Australia but from imported ingredients. After that, the manufacturer will have to describe the stage or process that takes place, such as `Assembled in Australia from imported goods' and `Packed in Australia from imported goods'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the scheme is very popular. We are getting indications that business is already coming onside by wanting to comply with the new terms.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I am very pleased to be able to inform the House today of the results for the December quarter 1993 which show a record number of passengers flying in Australia's skies. These are quite fantastic figures showing enormous success. Almost 5.5 million passengers flew domestically in Australia to the December quarter of last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following upon the aviation reforms announced in our One Nation statement, we have seen substantial changes in the operation of Australian aviation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know whether that is a promotion or a demotion. Honourable members might be aware that the governments of New South Wales and Western Australia have announced their intention to proceed with professional standards legislation, which will set out particular standards which professions should meet and, given that the standards are met, propose to introduce a capping regime on the amount of liability which can be awarded against these professions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth shares with those two state governments a deep concern at the levels of liability which professionals now face, and that is a broader question throughout the entire community. The Commonwealth also agrees that there needs to be reform in this area of the law. However, at this point, the Commonwealth does not favour the introduction of capping regimes on the liability. Rather, the path which the Commonwealth is exploring, in conjunction with the government of New South Wales, is an examination of the law on joint and several liability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week the New South Wales Attorney-General, John Hannaford, and I announced that Professor Jim Davis, a leading academic tort lawyer from the Australian National University, would be undertaking a review of the law of joint and several liability to see whether there is a case for reform. This is a particular concern for auditors. For instance, if it is found that an auditor may be five or 10 per cent responsible for the losses suffered in some corporate malpractice through some failure of the audit function, nonetheless that level of responsibility does lead to 100 per cent liability. This has led to widespread concern, particularly from auditors but also from other professions.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those circumstances one may have thought that today it would have been possible for this incompetent, dishonest minister to be dragged before the bar of this parliament and questioned. One would have imagined that it would have been possible for us to ask the minister to explain how it was that she implicated the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) yesterday. She might have been able to explain to us why it was she misled the parliament for the third occasion yesterday. She may have been brought before this parliament to be further questioned by my colleague the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) about her stewardship of $30 million&mdash;not of her money, not of Labor Party money, but of the money of the taxpayers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning, believing the importance of the occasion demanded the attendance of the minister, I wrote to the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley). In the letter, which I will table, I said to the Leader of the House that it was clear from the ongoing public concern about the performance of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories that she should attend question time today in order to answer questions about her stewardship of our money&mdash;not about the Labor Party's political convenience but about what she did with the money of the Australian people. I got this unbelievable response:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While you are at least consistent in the point you make I remind you that on several occasions yesterday I informed the House that the Government would persist with its roster system under the terms and conditions announced last week by the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>I might interpolate there that this is a roster that has been rigged to protect an incompetent and stupid minister. This roster has got nothing to do with the accountability of ministers before this parliament. Mr Speaker, if you think for a moment that this roster has not been designed to suit the political convenience of the government, I will read the text of a message I got from a senior officer in the department of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean):</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Crean has asked his department for 3 to 4 proactive "cute" (his word) questions on the days on which he will appear before the House (Monday and Tuesday)</PARA>
<PARA>This is a message from a senior officer. That is the measure of the contempt that this crowd opposite has for this institution of parliament. They do not care about accountability. If the accountability of a minister before parliament means anything, that minister should have been in here this morning to answer that censure from the honourable member for Higgins. That is where she belonged. She was in the building. For heaven's sake, she voted in the motion, but she was not here to answer it, any more than she has appeared on any of the major news programs to be interviewed about her handling of her responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She is a discredited, politically corrupt and politically dishonest minister. She is a minister who ought to be dragged, screaming if necessary, before this parliament to be made accountable for the way in which she has abused the trust placed in her by the representatives of the people&mdash;because that is what she has done. Our complaint is very simple and very fundamental. That complaint is that all of the arrangements that have been embraced by the Leader of the House and the Prime Minister over the last few weeks have been designed to rig parliament to protect weak, stupid, incompetent ministers from accountability before this parliament. That has been the design and it has been put together by a very arrogant Prime Minister, aided and abetted by a very arrogant Leader of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Leader of the House knows darn well that, if this parliament is to mean anything when a minister is really on the rack, that minister ought to be in here answering questions.

That is the request that we made to the Leader of the House. That he knocked that request back with the normal arrogance and contempt that he displays towards the opposition, mirroring the contempt that his leader displays towards the opposition and the rest of the Australian community, only serves to underscore the fact that all of these arrangements have been designed to protect the incompetent from the scrutiny of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what the new roster is all about. The new arrangements are all about protecting ministerial failures like the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories.

The Prime Minister has been averaging two opposition questions a day; he has been averaging one question a week from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). He got seven questions on Monday, so he came up to his weekly average in one go.

That was that ministers were rostered on for two days a week and that there would be an opportunity to question them on those two days a week.

I have been informed that certainly it is contrary to the guidelines.

The point I have made in this parliament before, and which he knows quite well, is that there were practically no members of his constituency present.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, I present the report of the committee entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The National Crime Authority and James McCartney Anderson</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KF4">Mr CLEELAND</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I draw attention to the fact that my colleague the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) also wishes to make a statement on this matter. This report is the result of an inquiry by the committee as constituted in the previous parliament. Although now its chairman, I was not then a member of that committee so I did not hear or anticipate any evidence which forms the bulk of the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report concerns a matter of great importance, not just to the National Crime Authority but to law enforcement bodies throughout Australia, be they state or federal police bodies. It involves the use of what are commonly known as criminal informers and, in this case, a particular criminal&mdash;James McCartney Anderson. There is no doubt whatsoever that, without the use of informers, law enforcement and the detection and conviction of major criminal activities would be severely diminished. Indeed, over a number of years there has been no question that many major criminals have been detected and put behind bars simply because those in the criminal field have acted as informers for a variety of reasons and assisted in the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that James McCartney Anderson is a person who one could not say a nice word about. He is a person of low repute, criminality and with very dubious antecedents to say the least. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that McCartney Anderson was of use in the circumstances of his involvement with the National Crime Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think all honourable members of this House and, indeed, the public need to be kept aware of the fact that any person who has been involved in law enforcement understands fully that those who wear the uniform deal with those who are quite often the scum of the earth. In that sense, they quite often have to literally go into the gutters to mix with these people in order to get the information that we in this House want which produces the results we want. My colleague from Western Australia, who is also a former member of the Western Australian police force, understands fully what I am talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst honourable members of this House may sometimes wonder at the use of informers and wonder why police and the NCA associate with people like McCartney Anderson, nevertheless they are important. This House and, I believe, this report recognises that fact. I urge all honourable members to read it. It could also be called the novel about the story of McCartney Anderson. It is perhaps a bit larger than I, the current chairman, might have wished it to be. Nevertheless, in my view, it is an important report and one which I urge all honourable members to read. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr O'Keefe), who I acknowledge was a member of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority at the time of the production of this report. Following comments from the present chairman of the committee on the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The National Crime Authority and James McCartney Anderson</EMPHASIS> that has been tabled this afternoon, I, as a former police officer in the Western Australian force, also concede quite readily that informers are a very important part of police work and have been ever since the formation of modern policing techniques. I for one would never want to contemplate a law enforcement or justice system where informers were not a part of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing about the report and the inquiry that led to this report is the peculiar relationship between James McCartney Anderson and the National Crime Authority at the time, the development of that relationship, the sort of milieu in which it took place, aspects of McCartney Anderson's background and, in particular, the unsolved mystery of the disappearance of Juanita Nielsen in Kings Cross on 4 July 1975, which Anderson was suspected of being involved in. Certainly it is a matter that ought to have been considered much more thoroughly by the National Crime Authority when it considered entering into a relationship with&mdash;as the present chairman of the committee, the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland), has quite rightly pointed out&mdash;a person of virtually no credibility, a person who is a readily self-admitted criminal and a person who has been involved in notorious activities in Kings Cross for, I believe, as long as he has been in Sydney. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As long as Saffron.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QT4">Mr FILING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not quite as long as Saffron. He has certainly been involved in the underworld. I suppose that in the years when corruption was more rife in that part of Sydney he was involved in the upper world of the Kings Cross nightclubs, drug trafficking and standover methods. In those days, all those sorts of things went on&mdash;they probably still do to a certain extent&mdash;in Kings Cross in full view of the police. To a certain extent, Anderson's antecedents, as we in the police force like to call them, should have alarmed the National Crime Authority when it decided to enter into a relationship with Mr Anderson.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, too, recommend that honourable members read the report. To use a cliche, it is a darned good read. It gives a very good insight into that period of New South Wales's social as well as criminal history. It particularly explores the mystery that surrounds the disappearance of Juanita Nielsen in 1975. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As some would know from their knowledge of that period, Ms Nielsen was an heiress who ran a newspaper in Kings Cross. She campaigned during a period when there was a fair amount of redevelopment in the area. I suppose that she started coming up against the people who were anxious to reap the rewards of development in the area. At that stage&mdash;I suppose at the peak of that difference or opposition&mdash;she disappeared. The last place she was seen was the Carousel nightclub in Kings Cross on 4 July 1975, where she was alleged to have gone to discuss advertising in her newspaper with an employee of the nightclub. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that in 1983 the jury in the inquest which looked into the Juanita Nielsen disappearance found that it was not able to say how, when or where Nielsen died. It added this sensational rider to its findings:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is evidence to show that the police inquiries were inhibited by an atmosphere of corruption, real or imagined, that existed at the time.</PARA>
<PARA>Over a long period we conducted a thorough inquiry. We were assisted to that end by the services of John Basten QC who acted as counsel to the committee during that inquiry. I would like to personally thank Mr Basten for the assistance he gave me as a member&mdash;and of course to the committee as a whole&mdash;in dealing with the enormous amount of material that was available and that was used as part of the background to our inquiry and also during our hearings at which there were a number of witnesses. A total of 20 witnesses appeared. They were drawn from amongst those who worked at the authority from 1984 to 1988, but they included eight persons who had never worked at the authority. As is mentioned in the report, Mr Anderson himself appeared before the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of conclusions were reached by the committee following the hearings and assessment of that information. I must point out that in the first instance the committee concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee did not find that any breach of any statute had occurred in the Authority's dealings with Anderson&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it is important to point that out&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the committee did not consider that its sole criterion of assessment ought to be whether a statute had been breached. The Committee also asked whether the Authority had acted in accord with the dictates of sound management and administration.</PARA>
<PARA>We found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Authority did not conduct any formal assessment of whether it should use Anderson as an informer or witness before entering into its relationship with him. The Committee considers that such an assessment should have been made.</PARA>
<PARA>The conclusions went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considers that this assessment would have shown that using Anderson in the way that the Authority did was clearly a very marginal proposition. In the Committee's view, the assessment would have noted the de facto immunity Anderson would gain from his relationship with the Authority in respect of his past criminal activity; the real possibility that he was engaged in criminal activity in late 1984; his suspect motivation; his questionable credibility; and the lack of a compelling need to use him as a source of information and evidence on Saffron.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Abe Saffron was target No. 1. Another conclusion stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was told in November 1992 by the current Authority that, under procedures now in place, it would not commence the relationship with Anderson in the way that its predecessor did in 1984.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee also found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Anderson used his relationship with the Authority to try to blackmail Saffron. Anderson claimed Saffron owed him a large sum of money . . . The Committee considers that the Authority's failure to respond&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, to allegations surrounding that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">was totally unacceptable. It should have terminated its relationship with Anderson immediately it found out what he was doing.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee also found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both the Authority and Anderson obtained only limited benefits from their relationship . . . Anderson provided the Authority with information of very variable quality in relation to other aspects of its Saffron investigations . . . The logic of his position as a Crown witness, however, ensured that he would not be prosecuted along with Saffron for his part in the conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth of tax due.</PARA>
<PARA>It also commented in those findings:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Anderson may have obtained some de facto immunity from investigation and prosecution for other alleged offences. If this happened, it would have been because of two factors. First, it was not in the Authority's interest to investigate Anderson while he was providing information and evidence to it. Secondly, there are tacit understandings among police that one officer does not interfere with another's informer, unless a serious offence is involved.</PARA>
<PARA>In that relationship, Anderson in fact travelled and lived overseas at the expense of the authority. The committee concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee does not consider that the Authority should have assisted Anderson to travel and live overseas. If Anderson insisted on living overseas for security reasons, the Authority should have done without his assistance.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee also considered that the payment to Anderson of a sum of $US12,000 was not justified on the termination of the witness protection arrangement in November 1988. The report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee considers that the above criticisms of the Authority should be read in the light of three modifying factors. First, when the relationship was entered into the Authority had just been established, and some allowance has to be made for this fact. Secondly, the Committee recognises that Authority staff dealt with Anderson in the way they did as the result of judgments they made in good faith about what was most appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA>The third aspect of that is the context in which the relationship had occurred. We pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the early 1980s, there was an emphasis on the benefits of using informers as a means of tackling organised crime, and the negative aspects were not given equal emphasis.</PARA>
<PARA>We concluded by stating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes that law enforcement agencies are now far more cautious in dealing with informers. The Authority's 1992 informant management procedures are one indication of this.</PARA>
<PARA>Members of the joint standing committee have, as part of their duties, an obligation to oversee the activities of the National Crime Authority. This particular reference was given to the committee on 28 November 1990 following a resolution of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is a good way of assessing the peculiar environment, atmosphere and circumstances in the early part of the 1980s as the evolution of the National Crime Authority commenced. The authority's reference No. 1 was granted to it on 19 October 1984. Following that, on 20 December of that year, Anderson was first interviewed by authority lawyers and investigators. Perhaps far more trouble ought to have been taken in looking at Mr Anderson's antecedents, examining in particular the disappearance of Juanita Nielsen and the allegations surrounding Anderson in relation to that disappearance and the other aspects of Anderson's criminality and his activities or behaviour that should have alerted the National Crime Authority at least to have very severe reservations about the use of Anderson as an informant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned at the outset that I agree with the current chairman that informants are a very valuable part of the police system as well as the justice system. I think that under the circumstances which prevailed during that period, perhaps there was a lack of clear managerial control over the use of Anderson. Because of the evolution of the authority, its particular structure at the time and the way in which the operations were conducted within the authority, perhaps there was some detachment at the top from the area which was actually at the coalface or dealing with people like Anderson. Under those circumstances, I think it was quite right of the committee to have examined this particular relationship with a view to looking at that particular aspect of Anderson's background and his involvement in the 1975 disappearance of Juanita Nielsen, a matter, I might add, that is still unsolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to acknowledge the assistance given to the committee by Steve Curran, the acting secretary of the committee. He spent a lot of time assisting with material compilation for this particular report. The report has taken a long time to get through and eventually be tabled. I could make some comments about that, but I will not. The fact that all of that information is included in the report is of benefit to honourable members who want to inform themselves of this particular period in the history of the NCA and also want to look at the circumstances surrounding that evolvement of the relationship between the National Crime Authority and James McCartney Anderson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to point out that the inquiry was triggered, to a certain extent, by some articles that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> written by Peter Rees and Arthur King. Those two gentlemen visited the authority in 1986 to put to it their concerns about Nielsen's disappearance. Their dedication in trying to find out the facts behind the Nielsen disappearance is to be commended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the House for giving me the opportunity to make these comments under the circumstances. May I also acknowledge the former chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay). I think that he did well in chairing the numbers of hearings and discussions that we had. I would also acknowledge Senator Crichton-Browne, who was the mover of the original motion in the Senate which gave rise to the reference to the committee, and also other members of the committee who participated in the long hearings during that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the report is a darn good read. I recommend it to honourable members. It still leaves unresolved one of the great criminal mysteries of the 1970s. It is incredible that, considering the time, the circumstances and the peculiar atmosphere of corruption and crime that existed in Kings Cross in those days, it is a mystery that still merits investigation by some agency to ensure that the person or persons responsible for the disappearance of Nielsen are at some time brought to justice. It seems incredible to me that, with all the resources at the disposal of the New South Wales police and, following that, the National Crime Authority, we are apparently no closer to solving that particular mystery than the people who comprised the jury of the 1983 Nielsen inquest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my concluding remarks yesterday, I made reference to the community housing sector and the aims and objectives of the government for its development and expansion. We intend to double the size of the community housing sector to at least 25,000 units of housing stock by the turn of the century. We view this sector as being well placed to meet the housing needs of low income earners and those with special needs in the community. For this sector to fully develop its potential in this regard and to achieve the growth necessary to meet these above needs, greater effort needs to be undertaken in the training of voluntary managers in the sector and in financial planning that will underpin its long-term growth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One great advantage of community housing is its flexibility in meeting the local housing needs of special groups in the community. It has the capacity to link effectively with support services needed by many in the community. For example, throughout 1993-94 the program will build upon initiatives already developed in the provision of housing for persons with physical and mental disabilities and other measures to assist those persons in their transition from institutional to other forms of care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government also believes this program can provide more services to clients who leave supported accommodation. Therefore, the government has asked the states to allocate at least 10 per cent of the community housing program to the provision of housing for people with specific housing and support needs. The government has made a financial commitment to the community housing sector and its expansion in the strong belief that this sector can play an important role in meeting the special housing needs of many in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take up a few points made in this House by the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan). She huffed and puffed about the fact that the government had not engaged in extensive consultations with the opposition on the amendments proposed to the Housing Assistance Amendment Bill. She made several points which were quite outrageous, considering she is the spokesperson on the opposite side of this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She had the hide to criticise the government for not making some headway in reforming the public housing area. Obviously, she has not read the Industry Commission report. It said two interesting things: one was in a general sense and the other was in a more specific sense. In a general sense, it endorsed the notion of public housing as a cost-effective way of meeting the housing needs of low and middle income earners in Australia. In effect, the government, through its budgetary allocations and the priorities it has set in this area, believes, as the IC does, that public housing is a most cost-effective way of meeting the housing needs of many Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That view is not shared by the opposition. In Fightback the coalition, in its so-called wisdom in this particular policy area, sought to emasculate the housing expenditure of the Commonwealth by some $450 million. One does not have to be an Einstein or an intellectual giant to appreciate the impact that would have on the ground in the states and in local communities throughout the length and breadth of Australia. It would simply mean that the state housing authorities would not be able to increase the public housing stock nor maintain it. They would have to off-load it, which would simply mean in the long term that many Australians who rely on the provision of public housing to meet this basic human need would not have access to either affordable or appropriate housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the micro level, we agree with some of the comments made in the past about the state housing authorities. They were developed in the 1950s and they are centralised in quite bureaucratic structures. They have not been as responsive as they could have been to the needs of people in regional communities. The IC conceded that, over the term of Labor governments, both at the state and federal level, we have made giant progress in making these housing authorities even more responsive to the needs of constituents. We have seen significant improvements in the management and delivery of public housing in the states. So it is a bit of a furphy for the honourable member for Moncrieff to come into this House and level criticisms at this government for not undertaking reforms in public housing. The financing of public housing is central to Labor's belief that federal governments have a role to play in the provision of affordable and appropriate housing for Australians who are not able to meet their housing needs in the private market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have ranged across many issues in my speech. My colleague the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Quick), who sits to my right, will certainly be taking up some other issues with regard to the Housing Assistance Amendment Bill. So I conclude my remarks at that point. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Housing Assistance Amendment Bill, I do not want to refer so much to that which members of parliament or politicians have in connection with the whole aspect of housing throughout Australia. I wish to refer to what is on the public record by way of audit reports, Human Rights Commission reports and Industry Commission reports. It indicates a degree of criticism which is valid in many ways.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In audit report No. 6, the Auditor-General talked about Commonwealth-state agreements. Quite a few comments indicate that there is a lack of definition and clarity with respect to the guidelines of these agreements which makes it difficult to determine how these programs will operate and how the funds will be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the timing and method of payments, the Auditor-General indicated that, by adopting such practices, it was estimated that about $50 million could be saved annually on the $1 billion paid to the states under the agreement. There seems to be considerable scope for improvement in this area, as the Auditor-General's survey of specific purpose payments indicates that payments were made monthly in less than 20 per cent of the cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When talking about specific purpose payments it is interesting to note that the Auditor-General found that the Commonwealth needed to be more involved. Obviously, the dollar for dollar arrangements for these specific purpose programs would be the responsibility of the Department of Finance. We have been talking lately about the sports grants given by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly). There was a need for a dollar for dollar arrangement to exist with some of those sporting clubs and cultural bodies, yet that dollar for dollar arrangement was not supervised by the Department of Finance, as the minister indicated in question time. The Auditor-General indicates that there should be an awareness by the Department of Finance in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then realise that over many years the Commonwealth has subverted the states' responsibilities in regard to specific purpose grants and so on. Richard Court, the Premier of Western Australia, will be putting the proposition to the other premiers that over a period of time the states' sovereign rights have been undermined in many ways. These agreements are just one of the ways that has been done. I look forward to his presentation of that argument when the state premiers next meet with the Commonwealth because I believe it is a real issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now turn to the subject of the Industry Commission report which has been floated in this debate. The criticisms that are levelled at that draft report, as recently as October 1993, suggest to me that the Commonwealth's desire to take over the whole operation of the housing industry, even though it is supposed to be a dollar for dollar arrangement with the states, has led to much concern in the community. In my area there is a very active group called the Mackay Tenants Group. This group met with two of the commissioners in Mackay to discuss the draft report and they were far from satisfied with the responses they obtained. The response the group received from the commissioners was, `We are here to hold these hearings. But it does not really matter what you say. We are going to continue on the way that we were going'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it was agreed that there were some valid and interesting points made, there did not seem to be any reassurance that there would be any changes. The Mackay Tenants Group said that its concerns included the security of tenure, rent setting, allocations and departmental splitting. They believe department splitting would mean that people would be accountable to many other areas and this would increase the inefficiency that might already be prevalent. A newspaper article in Mackay quotes the leader of the group as having said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the security of tenure proposed by the commission would only guarantee tenure in an area and not in a particular house. It would also tie young couples to two to five year leases.</PARA>
<PARA>The article went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the commission wanted to turn the Department of Housing and Local Government into a huge property developer/manager and extend the Family Services Department to include tenant management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"This would see too much control of one person's life in the hands of one government agency."</PARA>
<PARA>The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Mackay Tenants Group opposed changes to the allocation of public housing because it felt the new system would be open to abuse and manipulation unless strict guidelines and boundaries were put into place. She doubted the commissioners would reassess the issue . . .</PARA>
<PARA>As is common in many public inquiries, the impression is given, rightly or wrongly, that in draft reports commissions go out to justify what they have in place and do nothing further with it. The group was concerned about the altered relationship that would exist if the Commonwealth intervened and changed the existing arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now deal with the bill which is before the House. The government sees this as a long-term financial commitment to the provision of public housing funding, and the provision of new Commonwealth housing programs and continued support for the crisis accommodation program. The government states that the actual diminution in the funds available over the next three years is a result of the underspending by some states. But it still says that the crisis accommodation program has a very high priority and that this bill actually justifies the underspending of capped funds by the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is the case that some states have been underspending in this program it is certainly not borne out by the actual situation that exists within the community, particularly in relation to crisis accommodation. I will deal later with two specific areas: ATSIC and the South Sea Islanders' situation. There is an accommodation crisis in the community. This crisis can be affected by the Commonwealth and states getting together to provide extra funds in certain building categories. It distresses me to realise that some of the states have been underspending in this regard. This leads me to ask the question: are the states fair dinkum about this whole agreement and providing funds where they are most needed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence of the need for accommodation within the community is there for all to see, particularly in time of recession. People were trying to fight against high interest rates which dispossessed many of the type of accommodation they had or were seeking to have and limited the availability of other types of accommodation. Even though I am a federal member, some of the greatest complaints I have, and some of the most prevalent representations I have to make, are in connection with the state housing authority and the provision of crisis and rented accommodation</PARA>
<PARA>to people who have a desperate need but who have been on waiting lists sometimes for as long as two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now talk about the funds being made available to ATSIC through its housing cooperatives, as they are known in many places, and the ineffectiveness of some of those cooperatives. Again I can speak only about my local area. I believe there is a growing concern within the community&mdash;and it is not racist in any form whatsoever&mdash;about the funds being allocated for specific programs. It would appear to some people that the funds are not appropriately applied to provide for the need that exists in the society. I believe people are not so concerned about the extent of the expenditure but how appropriately it is being used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again I refer to the $30 million which has just been allocated under the community cultural and sports program. People in the community are concerned that if they are going to pay this money&mdash;and they are taxpayers' funds after all&mdash;they want to see it spent in the areas of need, not in the areas of want. I believe this is a very appropriate concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could probably make a judgment in connection with the ATSIC arrangements for housing for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders by what happens within my own electorate. This has been a continuing source of annoyance for about 10 years, particularly within the coloured community in Mackay. It appears that to be a member of the Mackay Coloured Co-operative Housing Society a person has to adhere to certain man-made rules and not adhere to the rules of the association itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About four years ago, I raised with Mr Hand, the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the concerns that existed in relation to this matter. I had a need to raise those concerns again with the current Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner). In connection with these complaints, I wrote to both the minister and the ATSIC commissioners. I had not received a response so I was forced to put the questions on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. Again, these questions have not been adequately responded to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened in the past is that the control of the Mackay Coloured Co-operative Housing Society has rested with or been vested in one family. That family basically determines what the membership is. They determine who comes to the meetings and they also determine how membership expulsions or withdrawals are occasioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a particular situation last year at the annual meeting where people were put in front of the door to stop certain people who wanted entry, because the secretary had said that they were no longer members. I drew the minister's attention to the fact that there have been membership expulsions and that there were irregularities of conduct. These matters have been reported to the cooperative housing society registrar in Queensland. All of these matters have not yet been satisfactorily resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise this issue not only as a matter of a complaint that has not been addressed either by the minister or by ATSIC itself but also to state the fact that the money being allocated for housing is not getting through to those people in need. If we debar those people of South Sea Islander descent because they are not indigenous people, we disfranchise a lot of people. It is a major concern if we disfranchise, say, 50 per cent of those eligible people from either getting rental assistance or being able to acquire their own home. I raise this matter not as a result of any politicking in this area but because of the real concerns within society that money is not finding its way through to the proper area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal with the other area I mentioned: the people in the South Sea Islander community. Mackay has about 25 per cent of Australia's total population of South Sea Islanders. It is a large community. They are a well respected group, but they are a much disadvantaged group. I will read from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The call for recognition</EMPHASIS> because it relates to this matter and I believe it is very important that we put it into perspective. Paragraph 5.2.1 deals with housing ownership, and states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Home ownership is a good indicator of people's wealth; indeed, most of Australia's wealth is in the form of dwellings.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the great Australian dream is to be a home owner. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">South Sea Islanders' home ownership rates are lower than any other racial group in Australia, with the possible exception of Aboriginal people. Less than one-third of South Sea Islander households owned or were buying their house, with only one in seven being full owners. Another one-third of households were public tenants; the rest were mainly private tenants.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the aspect of the low housing ownership, as far as Aborigines are concerned, can be addressed if we appropriate the funds and use them as they should be used. The report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">South Sea Islanders' home ownership (owning or buying) rate is less than half the Australian average&mdash;30.8% of South Sea Islander households were owners or buyers in 1992, compared with an average of 68.3% for Australia in 1986. Moreover, South Sea Islanders are not buying their homes at the same rate as other people. Only 16% are buying their home, compared with 31% nationally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overall, South Sea Islanders' home ownership rate in 1992 is lower than every sizeable migrant community in 1986.</PARA>
<PARA>I want that fact impressed on the minds of honourable members because the South Sea Islanders have been part of our migrant population since the 1860s and 1870s. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even the newly arrived Vietnamese, Pacific Islander and Chilean communities had higher home ownership levels because more were buying. Ownership is an indicator of community wealth for these ethnic groups&mdash;either they have good jobs that enable them to get a home loan, or others in their group are able to lend them funds. After more than a century of Australian residency, South Sea Islanders have not achieved the levels of home ownership these immigrants achieved in a decade.</PARA>
<PARA>In fact the South Sea Islanders have been described as being the second less fortunate group in Australia. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">South Sea Islander home ownership is between the levels of rural and city Aboriginal people in 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For South Sea Islander home owners, the average cost of housing is $57 per week, but about half of these fully own their home. For those paying the mortgage, the average is $480 a month. The `rule of thumb' for bank housing loans is that the monthly mortgage should not exceed the weekly income; it is noteworthy that only one in seven South Sea Islanders earns $480 a week or more, and one in seven is a purchaser.</PARA>
<PARA>I could go on to speak in terms of the difficulties that members of this group have in education, in maintaining their traditional style of life, in health, and also in their job opportunities. In fact, I believe that their job opportunities would rate with those of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, who have a particular program to look after them. But there is no assistance available to the South Sea Islanders. To expect that these people should then have to get in a queue to get the crisis accommodation, or any other state-Commonwealth housing agreement, does not recognise the fact that all those other migrant groups can get in there beforehand and leave these people disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report was made available on 15 December 1992. It has been in the hands of the Attorney-General now for over 12 months. One of the problems that I find in this House is that we get a report on this and a report on that, or a committee looking at this or a committee looking at that, and when the report is finalised nothing ever actually happens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The South Sea Islanders are a proud race and have waited a hundred years for some type of recognition and some type of equality. I believe it behoves the state and the federal governments to move in connection with the problems that I see and to realise that this bill before us is a result of underspending by states on crisis accommodation programs. That situation is ludicrous, ridiculous and inequitable and I believe that something should be done in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a growing problem in housing as far as our aged people are concerned. I will not speak about the whole ambit of housing, but only on those areas in connection with the requirements of an ageing population. Two reports have indicated that, by the year 2031, 20 per cent of the population will be in the aged category. A crisis is already developing and this will be extenuated by the fact that not enough hostel and nursing home accommodation is being provided by the Commonwealth, even though it monopolises the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give one incident. A nursing home body that was formed in my electorate at Airlie Beach went to the department, worked with the department, provided plans, had the land allocated by the local government and was told it was going to get an allocation in the last priorities. This was not forthcoming. The allocation of beds was made not to the charity or the community group that was expecting some Commonwealth capital funding in this regard but to two private enterprise organisations. The funding was going to be provided to and controlled by them. I believe that the amounts of allocations are not good enough nor is the continual pushing of the community and church groups out of the way. I have always found them to provide excellent service and a better service than the private sector. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AV5">Mr QUICK</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Franklin)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (4.58 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the issue of housing and, in particular, the Housing Assistance Amendment Bill 1993. I regard this as an issue of great importance throughout Australia, in Tasmania and, more particularly, in the Franklin electorate that I represent. Unlike many other areas in Australia, the Tasmanian community not only requires housing that is secure, appropriate and affordable but also housing that is designed to cater for the wide-ranging seasonal climatic variations experienced in our southern state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Housing Assistance Amendment Bill is integral to the provision of housing, particularly for low income earners. My primary electorate office is located in a large, broadacre public housing area which encompasses the suburbs of Bridgewater and Gagebrook. Across the eastern side of the electorate of Franklin there are five other major public housing areas&mdash;Ridson Vale, Warrane, Mornington, Rokeby and Clarendon Vale&mdash;and many other smaller public housing areas are scattered right across the electorate. It, therefore, should be very easy for honourable members to understand my interest in housing and, in addition, my intimate knowledge of the types of housing concerns which pass through my office daily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this debate I intend to focus on the issues of public housing, funding for the provision of community housing, the supported accommodation assistance program and continued support for the crisis accommodation program. However, within that context, I will continually draw the attention of this House to the local situation in Tasmania and the types of reforms that are occurring there and in my electorate of Franklin. I make it quite clear that I do not believe, when talking on the topic of housing, that this significant issue can be in any way removed from other issues such as income, education, health and other community services. All of these issues are so closely intertwined that to attempt to discuss any of them in isolation is difficult and perhaps futile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In discussing this bill, I will attempt to restrict my speech to housing, but I hope that honourable members in this place will understand the significance and implications which underlie the issue of housing. The Commonwealth-state housing agreement, CSHA, has been and continues to be the facility by which housing has been provided to so many Australians over a significant period. The Housing Assistance Amendment Bill seeks to revise the Housing Assistance Act 1989 and, by implication, affects the Commonwealth-state housing agreement which forms schedule 1 of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is extremely significant in terms of funding, representing $1,042.39 million. The 1989 act allows for unpaid Commonwealth funds to be carried forward. So $82.3 million will be carried forward, making available under the CSHA in 1993-94 a total of $1.125 billion. In the same way that the building better cities program looks to the type of Australia that we want in the future, so too does this bill. The bill encompasses the needs of home buyers, public rental housing tenants and renters in the private rental market up to the turn of the century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obvious that long-term planning is the key to the provision of secure, affordable and appropriate accommodation. I am very pleased that this bill guarantees funding under the Commonwealth-state housing agreement until the end of 1995-96. In addition to that guarantee, state and territory governments have agreed to specific reforms which will mean that services should be more responsive to our changing community's needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my state of Tasmania, it has been of great concern to me that the state Liberal government has been underspending on the provision of housing. I am heartened that this bill incorporates a national core set of performance indicators that will mean greater accountability. I am also pleased to see a provision whereby states will not be paid Commonwealth grants more than one month prior to expenditure. It is only in this way that underspending by states can be prevented and, in addition, assist in targeting those groups most in need of financial assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mortgage rental assistance program is of particular interest to me. Unlike every other state and territory in Australia, Tasmania is unique in having a proportion of mortgage rental assistance program moneys distributed through a community based agency. I have mixed feelings about this situation and would ask members of this House to think very carefully about this type of reform occurring in their own state or territory&mdash;in particular, in their electorates. In essence, this type of reform can produce a service with less bureaucracy and with a more welcoming front to the community, but the very real danger is that the community based service is expected to provide the same degree of mortgage rental assistance program provision on a greatly reduced budget to that which would be provided to a state department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Housing Assistance Service, situated in Elizabeth Street, North Hobart, is a community based agency that distributes mortgage rental assistance program moneys to those single people without dependants seeking assistance in moving into private rental accommodation. When money is available for distribution to those people eligible for assistance, the line-up of people is often seen trailing on to the main street outside the agency. There is no doubt in my mind that the need for assistance into private rental accommodation is huge and the stress placed on the workers at the Housing Assistance Service is corresponding to that demand. There is also no doubt in my mind that the state government is getting an extremely good deal, certainly in terms of its financial commitment, by using a community based agency like the Housing Assistance Service to distribute these mortgage rental assistance program moneys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The crisis accommodation program is also one which all members of this House need to be familiar with and the complexities of this program need to be understood. The Human Rights Commissioner, Brian Burdekin, pointed out in his report on homelessness that the problem will not go away by simply providing more crisis accommodation. As someone who has worked in a young people's shelter, I can assure honourable members of this House that this is the case. Providing more crisis accommodation often leads to the growth of a subculture dependent on crisis accommodation and who will continue to be without the means necessary to become independent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Crisis accommodation is an extremely important component of an overall housing strategy, but I urge all honourable members here to consider very carefully any representations that are made to them by organisations for an increase in available crisis accommodation. Most homeless people are looking for safe, secure and affordable housing, not more temporary accommodation. Some of these people may need support in their accommodation, but it would really concern me if greater emphasis was placed on shelter type housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, housing needs are difficult to separate from other issues such as income, health, education and other community services. Every Australian has the right and should have the opportunity to be housed and to live independently. It is sometimes the case though that, for an individual, couple or family to live independently, some degree of assistance and support is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is with that in mind that I am very pleased that the recent review into the supported accommodation assistance program, SAAP, found that access to capital funding is very important to changing the program whose outcomes tended to be of a `bandaid' approach to one now where people are actively assisted to achieve independence and become productive and, hopefully, happier members of our community. As I said, I am relating this to particular organisations in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Tasmania, the housing young people's outreach&mdash;HYPO&mdash;program has already made very good headway for that type of outcome in SAAP. HYPO, through the efforts of its workers and that of other similar agencies, has developed a project by which purpose-built housing will be provided to young people. The two- and three-bedroom units are located in a warehouse and will be managed by a cooperative of young people, housing workers and interested people from the community. The accommodation provided by HYPO will be medium term. With the assistance of the cooperative and housing workers, these young people can now look forward to secure accommodation which will ultimately lead to a more independent and rewarding life within our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community housing program is a special form of housing that has the ability to take into account the special needs of specific groups within our community and, at the same time, offer the sense of security and direct control enjoyed by home owners in a more affordable way. As with the new direction taken by SAAP, the community housing program has the capacity to link housing with support services needed by many households in our community. The program also has the capacity to take on recommendations in the recently released report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Human rights and mental illness</EMPHASIS> by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission so that there can be better management of various people from institutional to other forms of care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians with mental illness do need more and better housing options. In Tasmania, housing agencies are dealing with increasing numbers of people with mental illness and have limited avenues to direct these people to suitable housing situations. Certainly to date, many of these people with mental illness have been housed in boarding homes and guesthouses that really do not offer the type of accommodation and support that those people so desperately require. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By asking state and territory governments to allocate at least 10 per cent of community housing program funding for the housing needs of these people with mental illness, that portion of the housing sector should grow and support the needs of those in the community who previously did not receive the support they so desperately needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Housing Assistance Amendment Bill 1993 amends section 15 of the Housing Assistance Act 1989 to allow the Commonwealth minister to authorise the full level of untied grants to a particular state, even if the minister cannot ensure that the state can meet its matching obligation from the value of home loans provided through its home purchase assistance programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth minister is, and has been for some time, in the invidious position of accepting a financial position put to him on the financial capacity of a state or territory. If he was not satisfied with the financial commitment of the state or territory to the Commonwealth-state housing agreement, his only real avenue to force the hand of the state or territory was to withdraw funding. The only real victim in that scenario would be those Australians in need of housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is now the occasion, and there will probably be the occasion in the future, where state and territory governments, due to fiscal incapacity, will be unable to fully meet their obligations under the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. I accept that, in the best interest of state and federal cooperation and that of those Australians who deserve the right to safe and affordable accommodation, the Commonwealth minister must at times have the legislative ability to waive or reduce a state or territory's obligation to match the balance of untied assistance in relation to these home loans. For the minister to not have the power would only hurt those people who are least able to defend themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It concerns me that the priorities of the state government in Tasmania in relation to housing fall far short of where they should be. That housing in Tasmania comes after a 40 per cent pay increase to state politicians without arbitration, the payment of close to half a million dollars to cover the court costs on the Rouse-Gray bribery case and the total dismantling of the state construction work force reflects just where the state Liberal government's priorities really do lie and they continue to frustrate those in urgent need of housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know it would not be appropriate for the federal government to intervene in every expenditure decision made by a state government. The point I make is that with every dollar spent as a result of a poor decision made by a state or territory government people in our community looking for housing must suffer. Every one of those high-flying decisions that usually bring a financial reward to those people who least need it has a corresponding negative impact upon those people most in need. It is that very simple message that is all too easily forgotten by too many people in positions of power. The state government in Tasmania may be assured that I will continue to monitor and challenge any dubious expenditure decision made, particularly during this period when that government is unable to meet its home lending requirement under the current arrangements of the CSHA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will allow the federal minister to waive Tasmania's matching obligations in home lending requirements and therefore allow the Commonwealth to release total funding for public housing. I know full well the demand for public housing in Tasmania and to restrict that funding would be a disaster in my home state and the electorate of Franklin in particular. I note that there is an approximately $2 million shortfall expected from Tasmania in home purchase assistance. I find some comfort in the assurance of the federal minister that he will be monitoring this situation very closely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In speaking to this bill it would be remiss of me to not respond to the comments made yesterday afternoon by the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), who seemed to trot out the usual Liberal drivel. The honourable member for Moncrieff should be aware that the Industry Commission has acknowledged that state authorities have made significant improvements in housing. Some comments are that housing stocks are better managed, that the authorities are more client oriented and that greater attention is paid to the environs and location of public housing in relation to community facilities, but I think this is basically due to the fact that we have had over a decade of federal Labor government rule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am really appalled by the gross hypocrisy of the honourable member for Moncrieff in coming into this House and complaining about reforms in public housing. As the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) stated, the opposition would have more than emasculated&mdash;I think gutted would be a far better word to use&mdash;the housing program under its Fightback program. It was going to slash $450 million from the housing program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission, even though it operates in an economic rationalist framework, has supported a mix of rent assistance and public housing combined with head leasing to assist low income households. This is the approach being pursued by this government. The Industry Commission not only strongly supported public housing but also gave implicit support for the provision of more public housing, a policy which is in direct contradiction to Liberal policy which favours sell-offs and a progressive reduction in public housing stock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues I have discussed here this afternoon not only are extremely complex but also affect the lives of many Australians.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is some time since I have spoken on housing in this place, but I need to get back into the debate when we hear the hypocrisy from those opposite in the way in which they present their effort in housing to the Australian people. I refer them to the document One Nation, published in 1992 at the height of high interest rates. I read to the enthralled members of the gallery what this government said about the purchase of dwellings and the needs of home buyers and renters in Australia. Under the heading `Dwelling Investment' the document states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Households are taken to have a desired ratio of consumption of dwelling services (as measured by the stock of dwellings) to total consumption.</PARA>
<PARA>That meant that it was an imbalanced situation that enough people had enough money to buy the houses that were available. What does this mean? The rich could buy the houses; nobody else could. One Nation is the document those opposite are living by here in this parliament, for all of these brilliant policies they are bringing forward. Day after day we hear about One Nation. That was a nation divided; that was a nation for the rich. This was not a nation where people who wanted housing could get housing. Now we are debating an aspect of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement, something that relates to the provision of housing rental assistance and purchase assistance for those on lower incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At last the matter comes back into the House and the government starts to think about people who have been hurting for the last three years. At the very time the government could have generated employment and opportunities for people by providing additional funds for state governments to boost the housing stock, to help cut back the queues of people waiting for rental assistance, waiting for accommodation, it walked away with a statement in One Nation that the stock of housing was in balance with the people requiring to buy. What it meant was those who had enough money could buy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The average price of a home in Sydney is $170,000. What young couple under the age of 35 seeking to purchase their first home can put together that package? It can only be after years of slaving and saving to purchase their first home. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services (Dr Theophanous), who is at the table, sits in a salubrious and elevated position here in the parliament, having forgotten where he has come from and the people of his own electorate. It honestly depresses me to see this occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer the House to the budget where the exact figures are contained of the Commonwealth's commitment to provide assistance to people requiring housing. I notice that over the next three- or four-year period there is a consistent decline in funding, except for the boost in two or three years time of a program called the social housing subsidy program. It has already been delayed for some time because nobody can work out the guidelines as to how it will work. The budget states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commencement of the social housing subsidy program has been delayed until 1994-95 to allow additional time to develop guidelines and approaches to shared home ownership arrangements in consultation with the states.</PARA>
<PARA>It will take those opposite two years to work out how to do it. It is bureaucratic language for saying, `We haven't got the money, we are thinking up an idea, we don't know how to deliver it, but in two years time we'll know how to do it'. That is what has been done in the budget. We just have to look at the budget to see that there is a declining commitment to the welfare housing sector for the people who need housing. It is dropping substantially in real terms, in dollar terms. The parliamentary secretary should not shake his head. If he is prepared to suffer the pain, I will read the figures to him. </PARA>

It is not a grandiose program that is funded on the basis of how many kids can be convinced to leave home or come into the establishment, it is a thoughtful, well-administered program.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commentary contains numerous ideas and suggestions in the nature of consider points which, if sensibly adopted where applicable to specific Commonwealth-State agreements, should stimulate improvements in this important sphere of public administration.</PARA>
<PARA>This report was brought down in September. The Auditor-General is coming up with constructive ideas to improve the administration of Commonwealth-state agreements and arrangements. I would like to read to the House three or four of the salient features that head the list. The first point on aspects of Commonwealth-state agreements states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Audits conducted by the ANAO in recent years have demonstrated that the administration of Commonwealth-State agreements has potential for considerable improvement, particularly in aspects such as accountability, value for money and effectiveness of program delivery.</PARA>
<PARA>The second point states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Expenditure reductions are possible by identifying and eliminating duplication of effort and adopting best practices through benchmarking.</PARA>
<PARA>The third point states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Audit activity at Commonwealth, State and other levels could be better integrated . . . </PARA>
<PARA>There is another series of points which are important but they do not impact much on the program before the House today. Let us look at Commonwealth expenditure in specific purpose payments&mdash;that is, tied grants, in simple terms, to the states&mdash;and at the growth in those grants over the last five years. In 1989-90 it was $12.7 billion and in 1993-94 it was $16.7 billion. The grants have increased as a proportion of payments to the states from 48 per cent to 53 per cent. So this government is tying more and more of its money. It is setting the conditions that states must comply with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made a grand statement about how there should be better relationships between the states and the Commonwealth. One process mentioned by the Prime Minister that the Premiers will deal with is that all of these matters will be looked at. The Prime Minister said, `We recognise the role of the states'. That is a fine opening statement; I do not know how he could avoid recognising the role of the states. Then he said, `We are going to make improvements in micro-economic reform and administration. But, if we make improvements, that is not a valid point for us to gather more funds'. In fact, the states have to do better, cop it sweet on less money and not squeal. If they are doing better, that does not entitle them to more money; it entitles them to less. It is the same old system revamped with different Keatingspeak. If they continue to be inefficient, they continue to claim more money than if they are efficient. In the housing area and tied grants area the government is increasing the number and proportion of tied grants to state governments. That is what the Auditor-General says&mdash;and he knows. Today the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) said, `Don't ask me to add up the sums; the Auditor-General does that. I just pay out the money. If a certificate comes back, that is all I look for. It does not matter if it meets policy objectives or anything else. That is not the minister's job; it's the Auditor-General's'. The Auditor-General is saying that the government has increased the percentage and the proportion of tied grants to the states and, therefore, its administration needs to be more careful. The government is telling them more about what it wants. The same thing applies to what the government is doing with the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General says that, in order to establish effective programs in housing or any other area, there must be good `consultation, communication and consultative arrangements'; in fact, that is one of the headings in the Auditor-General's report. Under that heading, he states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Good communication channels are essential to the efficient and effective achievement of the objectives of the agreement. Every agreement should identify the communication and consultative arrangements to operate between the various governments involved.</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments the government is moving were notified to the states yesterday and to the coalition at midday yesterday. That is consultation; that is good communication. That is following through the processes outlined by the Auditor-General and the processes which the Prime Minister will speak to the Premiers about when they meet for the Council of Australian Governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are you guys doing? You have these audit reports that you ignore. You have statements that you appear not to read in the budget, in One Nation. You have a Prime Minister who makes speeches that are supposed to capture front pages but which have no intellectual content because they mean nothing. Where are you going with administration of Commonwealth-state agreements in the relationship? You need to have some sort of clearly stated goal and an objective that you can clearly adhere to. You do not appear to be adhering to any advice from the officers of the parliament or even adhering to the statements of the Treasurer (Mr Willis). Even the statements of the Prime Minister appear to be unrelated to the real world and the real facts of life. I think you have to answer some of these questions, and you need to answer how are you going to improve communication to start with. The states are not concerned about these amendments. I know that. They think that this is a reasonable adjustment. Why do you not communicate with them? Why do you not tell them about amendments that are coming into the parliament ahead of time? Why do you not tell us in this parliament ahead of time? This is the new, open Australian parliament where everything is up for scrutiny, where we are having two chambers so that members can better apply themselves to understanding the legislation, and where there can be a better explanation to the Australian people of what we do here.

Mr Deputy Speaker, you will benefit from that in your electorate; you will be turning handsprings at the way in which your electorate is going to benefit from the Prime Minister's words spoken yesterday. I draw the attention of the House to the concluding paragraphs of the Auditor-General's report which deal with Commonwealth-state agreements of all sorts:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of housing, for example, data currently available to the department is insufficient to determine both the true levels of subsidies provided under the various housing assistance schemes and the overall exposure of the Commonwealth under its obligations to meet any shortfalls in the operation of those schemes.</PARA>
<PARA>We do need to know those things. I do not think that is intrusion. In that regard and in regard to consultation and communication this is a very sensible and constructive report. The shame of the matter is that the Commonwealth seems to be ignoring it. This report was brought down in September. The government can lob an amendment to the act on the table with 24 hours notice and expect us to debate the implications of it and have the state governments understand it, but the government can ignore a report like this for six months. It seems a strange way to do business. It seems to represent the attitude of a government that does not care or, if it was aware of the Auditor-General's report, which chose to ignore it completely and to go its own way. I do not think that is good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The housing industry in Australia is moving at good speed; land prices and values are increasing. That poses a difficulty for welfare housing. In a system with a declining budget, additional costs on the purchase of land will be imposed on state governments. There will perhaps be a shortage of materials; none are appearing at this point in Australia. There also may be some shortage of labour. The government needs to pay attention to that area. It should assess the adequacy of its total budget for future outlays on welfare housing. The government has chosen to ignore it during the harsh period that we have come through. I hope that it will not neglect it in the period ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend various state governments for their new approach to housing, particularly the Victorian government which sought to apply a very good administrative approach in the area of assistance to housing. The Victorian government has considered the draft Industry Commission report and has responded in detail, saying that it wants to see transparency and accountability built into the program, and that is laudable. The Victorian government strongly supports the principles of increased targeting of resources to those clients with the greatest need and of improved choice amongst those clients. Those are two fine objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">State governments are restricted in their capacity to charge market rents because the Commonwealth government is a bit twitchy about charging market rents. A number of administrators&mdash;not in a political sense&mdash;have expressed their concern that clients of housing commissions hang in there. Take a hypothetical couple whose children have moved out of home and are off their hands. That couple is paying minimal rent for a three-bedroom house when a townhouse would probably be adequate for their needs. It is okay to ask, `How do you get them to move out?' There is a requirement if there is a shortage of stock and a demand there. There are substantial queues that need attention. There must be a way of moving people on who are holding up accommodation by hanging in there when they should not be. </PARA>

They put their name on the list when their first child is born and after eight or nine years they could have three or four kids running around and still be waiting to get into a house that the government is supposed to give them assistance to get into. The parliamentary secretary is trying to advance the argument that a couple with no children should hold up three-bedroom accommodation for an interminable period.

The criticisms levelled at that program have been reinforced by the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a new member of parliament, I am appalled to observe the government's lack of consciousness in this whole process of accountability. It is highlighted by the so-called sports rorts program, which the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) has brought to the attention of the House over the last few months. The community is demanding more and more accountability from this place as to how its tax dollars are spent. The amount of that tax is ever increasing, via the taxation structure or the petrol bowser, so people are taking a much more accurate interest in how it is spent. I think it is time that the government and those who sit on the government benches recognise this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I realise that this legislation is not all that controversial and that to allocate $3 billion to the seven-year program in respect of housing is somewhat routine, I am really disappointed that in the debate on this legislation no answers have been given either by honourable members who have spoken or by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services (Dr Theophanous) in his second reading speech. He might be able to answer some of the criticisms that have been directed to this program by the Auditor-General. In a draft report issued late last year, the Auditor-General said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One aspect that is frequently overlooked by departments and agencies is the need for clear identification, measurement and reporting of Commonwealth obligations or exposure under the agreement.</PARA>

<PARA>These questions need to be answered. One of the issues which the Auditor-General was trying to track was the administrative cost of running these programs to ensure that maximum value was received by the people in the real world. A number of other criticisms have also been made about the program. I know that the honourable member for Corio made glowing references to the report by the Industry Commission. I do not share his confidence, because the report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Governments have a long way to go in assisting Australians who are most in need of housing. Many Australians remain in housing stress and in urgent need of assistance.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission considers it important that governments assess now what role they want public and community housing to take in the future and begin reforms so that people do not suffer needlessly.</PARA>
<PARA>These are real criticisms. I have not heard answers to those criticisms in any references in this debate. I will be looking for them when the parliamentary secretary closes this debate. Government members have spoken glowingly about the government's housing policy. Working in the industry over the last 10 years, I have observed that, whilst a problem solved by throwing around quantities of money might make those people who are signing the cheques and sending the money feel warm and cuddly, the effectiveness of those programs at the end of the day is what matters. I have witnessed, on the ground, what I consider to be blatant wastes of community funds. There are other more innovative ways that this government ought to consider. The policies we took to the last election tried to do that by moving those people who unfortunately have become dependent on public housing into a position where they can afford their own housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accessibility and affordability of appropriate housing can be created in a number of innovative ways. While working as a consultant, one matter that I developed a particular beef about was the excessive amount of government regulation. By the time a person has submitted a town planning application for a community development of fairly high intensity public housing, suffered the rigorous requirements and costs of advertising, and dealt with public inquiry and often criticism and objection, if eventually lucky enough to receive a town planning permit, that person then has to deal with building inspectors, plumbing inspectors, scaffolding inspectors and a whole host of other excessive regulations. All of this costs money. I think the suggestions of the Housing Industry Association, which has made inputs into the considerations of the Industry Commission, ought to be considered. These costs are unnecessary, time delaying and most frustrating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission report also refers to the cost of taxation. This criticism is described on page 163 of the report, which says that by OECD standards the tax burden on Australian properties is relatively high. These are more innovative ways in which the government could address the situation if it were serious about doing something about the long waiting list for public housing and facilitating a process by which Australians could be encouraged to accept the responsibility and buy their own homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of the things that I wanted to say have already been addressed by many of the previous speakers. I am anxious to see whether the government is serious about addressing some of the issues that I and other speakers from this side of the House have raised. We are anxious, as the government is, to see the needs of Australians met. We are not encouraged to hear the criticisms that are made by respectable authorities. We want to see that, when those criticisms are raised, they are met. The amendment before the House makes reference to the fact that there has not been a long consultative process. This legislation could have been an opportunity to address some of those concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue which I think the honourable member for Dawson made reference to, and another concern of mine regarding what I have seen during my involvement in the industry over the years, is that the government's public housing program is still very much welfare oriented. The Industry Commission report said that the question of the role of public housing in the longer term still remains to be answered. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is it to remain a residual tenure for those on low incomes&mdash;that is, welfare housing? The move to welfare housing rather than a tenure available to all appears to have occurred by default through progressively narrowing assistance by . . . targeting.</PARA>
<PARA>Something that always used to annoy me in witnessing a new development to provide public housing in my electorate was that in a short space of time the deterioration of that dwelling, contributed to by the lack of a sense of responsibility and any sense of equity sharing in the responsibility of maintenance, resulted in excessive expenses for repair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Programs that are occurring now in Victoria which encourage local cooperatives to have a greater self-regulation control on not just the maintenance but also the rental tenancy agreements and general controls are initiatives that ought to be encouraged. We should place the responsibility for the way that tax dollars are spent in a community cooperative. It does work. As a member of a rural constituency, I can say that when communities are together, when there is a strong sense of community spirit and community accountability, such programs can be made to work. One program working in Victoria already has 200 houses. It is a state-wide cooperative known as the Common Equity Rental Housing Cooperative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that these arrangements do is encourage the private sector to seek this sort of housing as a source of financing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The private sector currently does not have the confidence to invest in public housing because of the lack of accountability and conscience in the caring of properties.

In that sense, obviously, the obligations of all levels of government to help in the provision of housing are present as well as the obligation of the community more broadly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having agreed that we have that general social justice goal, it is obvious that there are differences of emphasis as to how one would go about achieving those goals. In some of the speeches I could not work out whether I was being requested to go in one direction or in another. For example, the honourable member for Mitchell started his comments by suggesting that there were some problems with the extent of home building in recent times. That is not true. In fact, in the last year we have had the second highest level of housing activity in the postwar period&mdash;the second highest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are looking at the housing issue primarily in terms of the total number of dwellings being built&mdash;that is obviously an important dimension&mdash;then the comments of the honourable member for Mitchell which tended to suggest that affordability was a problem for the majority of people or even for the average person are quite wrong. In fact, because of the reduction in interest rates and because of the packages that are being offered by many banks and other institutions, housing has become much more affordable than it was two, three or four years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are looking at what has in fact been a second revision. We have had to revise our forecast of dwelling commencements for 1993-94 to 168,000 from 157,000&mdash;up 11,000 from what was previously a very high level. So from that point of view we have to say that the government's macro-economic strategy in terms of its impact on the housing sector is working. Having said that, it does not follow that we will not have any problems in housing. Of course we will. Some other members have addressed these, and I will try to talk about them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the first instance, let me comment on the contribution of the honourable member for Dawson with respect to the specific problems of South Sea Islanders. I have just been given by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) responsibility for the access and equity program. One of the areas of implementation of the access and equity program involves housing. I will read the material that the honourable member for Dawson has presented to me on the special disadvantage that people of South Sea Islander background face and I will see what can be done in relation to this particular disadvantage. It is true, as the honourable member says, that a report appeared 15 months ago entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Call for recognition</EMPHASIS>. That report deserves a response from the government, and I will try to see that a response is given. I thank the honourable member for Dawson for bringing this question to the attention of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important when we are talking about the social justice dimension of housing, or indeed other social justice issues, that we remember that there are specific problems for specific groups of people, including people with particular ethnic, cultural or racial backgrounds. In that context, if a particular group has a specific problem we should focus on that problem and see what we can do to assist them. I give the honourable member for Dawson an undertaking that I will look into that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the general question of public housing, it is important to note that three points of view were put forward in the speeches made by members of the opposition. The first was effectively that there should be less public housing and more done through the market. This is not the view of the government. We believe that public housing has a significant role to play in this nation and as part of the overall provision of housing. We will continue to highlight that. We do not agree with those who argue that public housing should not be provided at the current level and that the private sector should do more. We believe both sectors should work together, but that the public sector has a key and very important role which we will continue to ensure it plays. The honourable member for Moncrieff seemed to be expressing an opposite view&mdash;that in fact the government was not doing enough in the public housing area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is also the employment question and I will deal with that in a little while&mdash;one thing at a time. Let me first refer to the fact that we are committed and we believe we should continue to do a lot in this area of public housing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Speakers on the government side have mentioned that in the Fightback package the opposition proposed to the Australian people&mdash;and this is a direct response for the honourable member for Moncrieff, who chose to make political points in this debate&mdash;a massive reduction of more than $400 million in this area of expenditure. Imagine the impact of that on the overall housing situation, especially on poor people who would have been most affected and most hurt by that sort of approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is possible to come in and criticise the government at the edges about various matters concerning the total budget for public housing, the fact is that this government is committed to a massive budget in relation to public housing and federal government support for housing. That is the key issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who say that there is an adjustment of $5 million or $10 million should look at it in the context of what would have happened had the opposition won the election and implemented the full range of Fightback policies. The whole area would have been massively slashed. Funding close to $1,000 million would have been reduced by more than $400 million. That is what would have happened had the opposition won the election and tried to meet its promise to cut&mdash;this depends on the figures one prefers to believe&mdash;between $7,000 million and $10,000 million from government expenditures, including housing. So that kind of criticism is also not acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue involves the role of welfare housing. A number of people criticised the government for using the report of the Auditor-General. But what did the Auditor-General say in his report? He said that it was very important for the Commonwealth to do more to ensure that the state governments meet their implementation responsibilities and that there were problems with implementation when it came to the level of the state governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did the honourable member for Mitchell suggest? He suggested that we should hand over the whole responsibility to the states. Some members of the opposition are referring to the Auditor-General's report as though it criticises the government while other opposition members, such as the honourable member for Mitchell, are saying, `One response is to hand over the whole of welfare housing to the states'. I do not know whether that is the official position of the opposition. Nowadays we have given up trying to work out its official position. I am simply commenting on the various positions of opposition speakers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, those who want to take notice of the Auditor-General's report&mdash;we obviously do&mdash;have to think in terms of making sure that the implementation mechanism with respect to the states is better managed. We do not have the power to direct the states in these matters. We can encourage them, cajole them and give them guidance. That is the sort of thing which the minister and his officials have been doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This leads me to the next item&mdash;a problem mentioned by the opposition&mdash;of insufficient consultation with the states with respect to these amendments. The honourable member for Moncrieff requested a delay of 24 hours. As it turned out, we had a delay of 24 hours. Other opposition members had the full benefit of that delay. I did not notice that they concentrated very much on the amendments. In fact, most of their comments were of a general nature. Very few of them concentrated on these amendments with respect to the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments are not controversial. There is nothing controversial here. It is not as though there is some serious problem. Nevertheless, we have had a delay. We have now had a very comprehensive debate, although most opposition members did not have any problem with the amendments. So I am not sure exactly why the honourable member for Moncrieff has moved her quite gratuitous amendment, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">deplores the haste with which the Government has prepared its amendment to the Bill;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">regrets the Government's failure to observe the normal parliamentary courtesies&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and so on. The fact is that we have now had the delay which the honourable member wanted. She is seeking an assurance from the government that normal courtesies necessary for the proper consideration of proposed legislation in this chamber be observed in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention to the honourable member that we will be introducing shortly a second chamber that will look at legislation in very great detail. That is a revolutionary measure in most of the countries that have democratic parliaments such as ours. There will be a very lengthy evaluation of bills. Therefore, the motion that she has moved is not necessary, because there will be a lengthy consultation and consideration of bills in the new arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that in her speech yesterday&mdash;unfortunately, I was not able to be present and hear it because I had to go to a meeting in Sydney with Disabled Peoples International&mdash;she talked about being fed up, upset and so forth with procedures in this House. I can only say that the new procedures should be given a chance to operate, especially in the second chamber. When they are given that chance, all honourable members will benefit. I ask her to be a little patient in relation to the new procedures. I am sure we will find that the debates will proceed in an even better way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude my comments by thanking all the honourable members who contributed to the debate. I thank all honourable members for their commitment to affordable housing for all Australians. Even though we may have some disagreements about how to do things, naturally the government is always open to suggestions and considerations&mdash;I know that this is true of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services (Mr Howe)&mdash;with respect to how we can get the system operating better in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a federal-state operated system. Because of that, we do not totally control all situations. Nevertheless, with goodwill on the part of governments, irrespective of their political colour, we can achieve the goal of affordable housing for Australians and ensure that no Australian is homeless. </PARA>

He referred in general terms to some matters that I had raised in my speech yesterday. I want to get in the record what I said. The comparison stands. I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is noteworthy that the states that had state Labor governments for several years, mainly Victoria and South Australia, were the ones with the highest proportion of population waiting lists for public housing.</PARA>
<PARA>I then gave some figures for the states, which I will not repeat at this point because they are fairly lengthy. I then said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These figures indicated that few inroads were being made in the backlog of demand for public housing and that some states and territories&mdash;most notably, Victoria, the ACT and the Northern Territory&mdash;were falling further behind in the provision of public housing. The steady increase in unemployment to more than one million after the dates I have mentioned has meant thousands more Australians have been added to those already in need. The recession we had to have, according to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), undoubtedly increased dramatically the already shamefully long waiting lists.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday these new clauses came into this place without any warning,  explanation to or consultation with the opposition. We had tabled in the chamber the amendment and the explanatory memorandum. We have had no explanation from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services (Dr Theophanous) as to the effect of the amendment. I would have thought a change that goes substantially to the heart of Commonwealth-state funding agreements and arrangements on housing might be explained. All the parliamentary secretary has said is that it will improve things. That may be so, but this parliament is being asked to amend legislation and change previous funding arrangements without an explanation of how, why or what. We are being told, `Here they are. They're good. Vote for them'.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It appears that I will have to delay the House for a longer period in order to answer the questions of the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan). She is quite wrong in saying that the ministers have not been consulted. We have had significant consultations with the ministers. The initiatives for these changes came out of discussions with the ministers about the proposed 1993 act and the fact that some of them were going to have problems with it. In order to accommodate the states and the requests of ministers, we brought in these changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that, the states were consulted on the actual amendments. Changes to purchase assistance matching were discussed with the Commonwealth-state standing committee on housing officials on 1 February and in bilateral meetings of the Commonwealth and state housing ministers in the past fortnight. As I have mentioned to the House, last night I attended in Sydney a function held by the Disabled Peoples International. The New South Wales Minister for Housing was present. He did not raise with me any concerns about this amendment. In fact, he is quite delighted that we are proceeding with this amendment in order to get the agreement passed and put into place so that we can do something about housing for people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now present in detail the reasons for the amendment for the benefit of the honourable member for Moncrieff. In amending section 15 of this act, by adding a new subsection 15(2A), the amendment to the Housing Assistance Amendment Bill sets out provision for the Commonwealth minister to authorise the full level of untied grants to a particular state in 1994-95, even if the minister cannot ensure that the state can meet the balance of its matching obligation from the value of home loans provided through its home purchase assistance programs in accordance with paragraph 13(2)(b) of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed new section 15A sets out the provision for the Commonwealth minister effectively to waive or reduce a state or territory's obligation to match the balance of untied assistance provided by the Commonwealth to a state for housing assistance from the value of home loans provided through home purchase assistance programs. This provision will apply for only 1993-94 and 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment will not, however, relieve an affected state of its grant matching obligations under the agreement. Commonwealth untied assistance provided under the Commonwealth-state housing agreement to the states and territories is used for a number of purposes, predominantly for building or purchasing public rental housing stock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth-state housing agreement requires states to match this untied assistance on a dollar for dollar basis, with at least half of the matching provided through state grants and the balance through the value of loans made under home purchase assistance schemes. However, difficulties have recently arisen as a result of lower demand for home purchase assistance products and the relatively attractive terms of commercial products in the current economic climate. The affected states have also indicated that they are not able to provide additional grant funding to meet the 1993-94 matching obligation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of 1993-94, where it has become evident that some states will not undertake sufficient lending under their home purchase assistance programs to meet their obligations under the agreement the CSHA provides for the Commonwealth to recover financial assistance already provided. In the case of 1994-95, where some states have indicated that they are unlikely to be able to meet their matching requirements the Housing Assistance Act requires that the minister not provide funds which will not be matched. This effectively means that the Commonwealth must reduce untied grants to a level that will be matched. The government considers that either to recover financial assistance already provided or to reduce funding to be provided would be undesirable and that is for the reasons I mentioned in my second reading speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. N.B. Reid)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Does the parliamentary secretary wish to seek the indulgence of the House to continue his remarks?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will reduce funds for public housing and in the light of the current demand for such housing would disadvantage those most in need of assistance. Also it would be undesirable to pursue such action where states are genuinely unable to meet such requirements because of changed market conditions. To force states to increase lending at this time solely to meet their matching requirements may result in loans being made to more marginal clients. This could impact adversely on the viability of the overall home lending program in the longer term as well as creating problems for clients should their circumstances change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any decision to waive or reduce the home purchase assistance matching requirement will be taken only after careful consideration of the circumstances leading to the need for such a course of action and will be determined on a case by case basis. Issues taken into account when making this decision will include the economic environment in the relevant grant year, the availability of alternative home lending finance products to low to moderate income earners, a state's lending effort and commitment in previous years, and the nature of the programs being offered by an affected state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not possible at this time to detail specifically the extent of any waiver or reduction of the home purchase assistance matching requirement. The financial information required for 1993-94 will not be available until the end of the financial year, and in the case of 1994-95 states are not required under the agreement to provide details of their matching proposals until 31 March this year, and even this will be based on estimated levels of lending only. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in 1993-94 it would appear that New South Wales will have a shortfall of the order of $130 million&mdash;its total obligation. Victoria's is difficult to estimate as it will depend on the take-up rate of its new shared home ownership program which is likely to be introduced progressively from April. Tasmania's shortfall is estimated this time to be around $2 million. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services (Mr Howe) will be pursuing the 1994-95 issues with the states. Any determination will be made only after consultation with the relevant state minister and after the federal Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services is satisfied that this course of action is the most appropriate. In the case of 1994-95, any action will only be taken after consideration by the government. To ensure ongoing parliamentary oversight these determinations will be tabled. The honourable member for Moncrieff should note that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This remedy to current difficulties will not be open ended. It is intended only as a short-term response to ensure that those in need of public housing are not disadvantaged. Policy in the home purchase assistance area is to be reconsidered later this year in consultation with the states and territories and in the context of the government's consideration of the Industry Commission report on public housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very positive amendment. It is intended to deal with what we hope will be a short-term problem. It is a very sensitive response to the genuine problems of the states as detected by the minister. The minister is to be congratulated for not cutting back on the Commonwealth's contribution, sustaining the Commonwealth's contribution and showing some understanding of the problems of specific states in relation to this matter, thereby fulfilling the Commonwealth's full commitment in relation to public housing and housing generally, as part of the government's continuing social justice commitment.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an example of a relatively non-controversial bill. There have been discussions between the Commonwealth government and the states over the need for an amount of flexibility. The opposition welcomes flexibility. We welcome the fact that an agreement was able to be reached between the Commonwealth and the states. I reiterate, however, that at the time the words of the amendment came before this parliament, from the office of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), they had not been shown to the states as the final words. There may well have been agreement beforehand, but the states could not tell us when we contacted them yesterday what the final words were. The states had not seen them and they were not aware that they were public until we made contact with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not resile from the point I was making yesterday or today. The parliamentary secretary should go back a little further than the debate on this bill yesterday to the preceding debate yesterday, to which I referred in my speech on the second reading, on the subject of consultation and consideration between government and opposition in this place. He should look at the debate relating to the standing orders when reference was made to this bill, and then he would have a better idea of my point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware that he was absent yesterday. He paid me the courtesy of saying beforehand that he had an important engagement to go to. These things happen. Honourable members cannot always be here for the debate but he paid me the courtesy of explaining why he could not be here. He read that into the record and I certainly did not have a go at him yesterday. However, I said yesterday that he should take a look at my speech. If he is going to come back today and refer to it only selectively, then he ought to have realised that in my speech there was reference to a previous debate and he might have enlightened himself on the relevance of that to this bill as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will say one other thing in that context. Part of the conversation the parliamentary secretary and I had yesterday, which was on the subject of his not being here, revolved around the fact that we were entering into a debate on standing orders. He said that, had it not been for that debate, he would have been here to hear my speech. He is aware that that debate took place; he is aware that it was an intervention and that it all happened yesterday, because it impinged very much on his ability to be present and participate yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, members of the opposition in no way resile from the view that we put forward that the information we have just been given in relation to these amendments presently before the House should have been given to us at the start. There was no reason for the office of the Deputy Prime Minister to say yesterday that the debate could not be deferred until today and that the bill had to go through yesterday. The bill could not go through yesterday. As a matter of fact, as I pointed out yesterday, the bill had already been here for more than four months so one day was not going to make that much difference if it were only for the matter of courtesies. We would have liked more than one day. As was referred to in yesterday's debate, there is an unwritten agreement called the seven-day arrangement, whereby the opposition has seven days from when a bill comes in until it is actually debated here to consider the substance of it. The point about these amendments presently before the House is that they are amendments of substance and we probably should have had seven days to contact people and get comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not say the parliamentary secretary is not telling me the truth when he apparently conveys the content of the conversation he had with the New South Wales Minister for Health yesterday; I am saying that opposition members are entitled to know what took place in that conversation from the New South Wales Minister for Health himself before we consider the amendment we are now being asked to agree to. I hope that is now clear. I point out to the parliamentary secretary that we will take the time and opportunity whenever they are available to raise in this place whatever we think is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am perfectly well aware of what the new arrangements are in relation to the extra chamber and extra debating time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems like quite a few hours ago that I had my first opportunity to start my address on Appropriation Bills Nos 3 and 4. Prior to the interruption, I was about to comment on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) which, in part, appropriates $175.7 million for the defence portfolio&mdash;including $88.6 million for defence facilities and a further $71.7 million for defence housing, reflecting rental payments to the Defence Housing Authority, which is one of the government's GBEs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only comment I want to make on that is that defence spending is a big ticket item as far as the government is concerned. We are all well aware of recent reports in the media on the progress of the contract between the Defence Department and the Australian Submarine Corporation in Adelaide. This contract involves something like $5 billion, of which up to about 80 per cent has been paid to the contractors. We have received one submarine; less than 40 per cent of the contract has been completed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That company has paid some quite handsome dividends to its shareholders. I think government members should be put on notice, and I am sure they have been. As a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts I know that the committee is maintaining a watching brief on this matter. The Auditor-General in his report expressed concerns as to the amount of risk the Commonwealth was being exposed to with the way the contract is structured, so it is going to be interesting to see what happens. I thought it would be opportune to mention that along with the money that is being appropriated in this bill today for defence spending. In terms of our total expenditure and the revenue in this country, $5 billion is an awful lot of money. When I previously addressed the House on these bills I followed the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott), who made a number of interesting comments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He certainly does and, as I said earlier today, it is always good to follow him because it makes it easier to speak, particularly if he is in the chamber. He came over here and sat with us. I thought he was going to leave the government and join the opposition after his comments about fuel prices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Gilmore made some interesting comments. One of them was about the levels of unemployment and also the labour market programs for which the government is appropriating a further $49.3 million. I think we should make a couple of interesting observations here&mdash;and I know that they have been made time and again to this government. This government, which has been in office for in excess of 10 years, has overseen the highest level of unemployment this country has experienced. We are seeing an enormous amount of spending on labour market programs. A number of these programs are under way in my electorate, and I will concede that a number of the labour market programs are good and are working. I refer in particular to the OLMA program. We have a very reactive OLMA committee on the mid-north coast that has developed a number of very good programs and is helping industry and that labour market adjustment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also seen some interesting exercises undertaken by the local skillshare organisation in Taree, in particular, by a couple of its operatives Eric Trad and Mark Burton who, with a bit of lateral thinking and industriousness, went out to Griffith, into the area that is represented by my colleague the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Hicks), to seek employment for a lot of the unemployed people in the Taree area. They were quite successful. This week 44 people went from the Taree area to work in the orchards and vineyards, and I acknowledge that those involved in this program are doing a very good job. I also acknowledge the help that the honourable member for Riverina and his staff have given these people while they have been establishing this interesting program in the Riverina area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, whilst expanding labour market programs in relation to the appropriation of extra funds, the government has not addressed labour market reforms or micro-economic reforms in the way it should have. It has been criticised by a number of different areas of industry in Australia for not doing so. It goes without saying that, until the government does address those areas, it is not seriously going to have any impact on the structurally unemployed, the long-term unemployed, that we have in this country. As the previous Treasurer said when bringing down the budget last year, unemployment is still the main issue that must be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said this week in debate in this House that unemployment and what the government is and is not doing about it will be the issue in all the upcoming by-elections. The forecast for growth has been revised to 3.5 per cent. Bear in mind that last year&mdash;I think it might have been prior to the election&mdash;the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said that if we cannot achieve four per cent growth we should all give the game away. We on this side of the House are still waiting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The revised estimate for inflation is two per cent. The revised estimate for investment is 4.2 per cent. The revised estimate for interest rates is low. We are still running a $16 billion deficit. It will be interesting to see what the forecast deficit in the May budget will be. What was the revised estimate for unemployment? It is the same as it was in the budget last year&mdash;10.7 or 10.75 per cent. The government is not willing to acknowledge that it will be able to do something about unemployment. It keeps talking about participation rates, but almost one million people are still unemployed. Those issues have not been addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labour market programs help alleviate the short-term problem; they do nothing about the long-term problem. The sooner this government realises that the better off we all might be; we might get on the road to some sort of a realistic and believable economic recovery in this country. The almost one million people who are unemployed might start believing some of the stories that the government is trying to tell them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The challenge is still there for the government. The task force on regional development has brought down its report to the government. The government has identified regional areas as being very critical in addressing the unemployment problems that we have in our economy. The regional development task force, headed by ACTU Secretary, Bill Kelty, brought down its report, but there was not much in it. I want to read into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> some comments made by the President of the NFF, whom the Prime Minister claimed every day during the debate on the Native Title Bill before Christmas as his greatest ally and best friend. The NFF news release states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NFF President, Mr Graham Blight, said that the Taskforce report proposed a tax-and-spend approach&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is funny, that is all this government ever does, and here is Mr Kelty recommending more of the same&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to regional development, undercutting its potentially positive contribution to economic recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Too great a degree of government intervention jeopardises fiscal restraint and threatens to displace private sector investment and activity, which in the long run must underpin regional economic activity," Mr Blight said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"We welcome the report's focus on infrastructure renewal, especially the goal of improving links between regional Australia and urban and international markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Australia has run down much of its publicly-owned infrastructure. Expenditure in this area is overdue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"However, by suggesting that fuel tax should be increased to fund much-needed rural road infrastructure improvement, the report fails to recognise that for economic recovery to occur business costs have to fall.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The massive tax burden imposed on Australia's transport system from fuel excise and sales tax had not been addressed. Neither had the need for improved competition in freight services," Mr Blight said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Taskforce also incorrectly recommended that taxes on business should be increased to address labour market adjustment.</PARA>
<PARA>How much more can the productive sector of this country withstand from this government? The taxpaying base of this nation is getting narrower, the burden is getting heavier and  sooner or later the further we go down this road people will just sag at the knees, give up and say, `Damn it all. Let's go and join the mob on the other side and we will stick our hand out'. How much more is this government going to load on to the productive sector in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the life of this government there have been enormous increases in fuel excise. In 1982, federal excise was 6.155c a litre. What is it this year? In February 1994, it is 31.75c a litre&mdash;absolutely incredible. In 10 years, this government has taken the excise from 6c a litre to 31c a litre, but the important fact to acknowledge is that it is not being spent on roads and transport infrastructure in this country. It is propping up all the other programs of this government that it is not prepared to redress and reduce. It is a high taxing, high spending government. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope that the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) has not stolen some of my time in tonight's debate because I will be saying some different things from that which he has enlightened the House with tonight. I want to talk about my electorate and review what has happened in the last 12 months since the election as regards the needs of that area. The electorate of Corinella is a substantial component of the south-eastern growth corridor of Melbourne. It is an area of young families, new housing and is growing at a phenomenal rate. The infrastructure needs in that area are significant and a major demand upon the local community and government at all levels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my first speech in this House, I spoke of those issues and of the need for the government to address them. I also talked, to some extent, about some of the developments on those fronts. I would like to take time tonight to detail to the House some of the movements and improvements that have occurred in that area that this government is responsible for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The local capital works program, which honourable members would know, was part of the One Nation statement and was a major innovation in the way we get money out there to provide important community facilities. The program itself was targeted to areas with high unemployment levels on the basis of local government areas. One of its main targets was to create jobs. It provided a significant fiscal stimulus and also worked to provide important community infrastructure of long-term benefit to local communities. The program was widely acclaimed at the time and has been since by local government. It also had a major component of joint funding with local government. This meant that the actual money provided from the federal level was added to so that the overall benefits to the community were much greater. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shire of Cranbourne is a major part of my electorate. Cranbourne received $1.92 million under this program. Projects already completed under the scheme include streetscape works in Main Street, Lang Lang, costing $90,000; the bicycle path from Shearwater Drive and Lyrebird Drive, Carrum Downs, costing $50,000; the Blind Bight Community House, costing $200,000, which I was pleased to officiate at the opening of recently; and the Cranbourne Community Centre, costing $480,000, which was a relocation of a neighbourhood house that was decrepit to modern premises to ensure that it could service the needs of that local community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Still under way are projects like the Hampton Park Community Hall, costing $660,000; the Berwick-Cranbourne Road roundabout at Patterson Road, costing $600,000; and the North Road construction from Langwarrin to Centre Road, costing $360,000. That is around $2 1/2 million in projects on the basis of a $1.92 million stimulus from the government. It shows that, if we consider what can be done in an innovative fashion with other areas of government, particularly local government, we can exceed those moneys to further benefit the community. The Cranbourne shire engineering manager, Bruce Conboy, said that the projects had provided hundreds of jobs throughout the shire and that the scheme showed that the federal and local governments can work together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn next to Springvale, an area of significant unemployment, which I share with the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy) and the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean). Springvale utilised the money to develop Springers Leisure Centre, which was opened recently. The centre, which took 10 months to build, provides three basketball courts, three netball courts, six volleyball courts, 10 badminton courts, two indoor soccer courts and a roller hockey court, as well as an extensive cafeteria and child-care areas. This is in an area where, basically, none of those sorts of facilities were available. This need was recognised by the council some 10 years ago. It had been working to try and get the money together since that time, but was unable to do so until this program came along. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The size of the building totals 6,290 square metres and is set on Tatterson Park, named after the late CEO of the council, Ian Tatterson. The design of the building was completed in September 1992, with council officers and consultants basing the design on community needs. Councillor Phillip Reed, the mayor of the city of Springvale said that Springvale had benefited from having this state of the art facility and also from the creation of 60,000 employment hours, generated in the building's construction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Project managers Civil and Civic won a five-star rating from the National Safety Council for its high standard of occupational health and safety, one of only two five-star ratings to be granted to a construction project in Australia. We can see there that the initiatives undertaken and the results were important to those local areas, which were in urgent need of those sorts of facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the building better cities program. Under the better cities program, this government is demonstrating methods by which the growth of our cities can be tackled. Improved urban planning, better land use, increased housing choices and affordability, transport costs and availability, and the need for integrated service provision with developments are all part of what will be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The south-east area strategy covers my electorate. That area strategy will generate about $67 million worth of activity over five years, finishing in June 1996. The Commonwealth contribution is $34.8 million, or about 53 per cent of the total expenditure. That program in the south-east area will look at the electrification of the Cranbourne-Dandenong rail line. Cranbourne is an area, as I said earlier, of major growth and has very poor public transport. It is an area which has a high incidence of two-car ownership but can hardly afford it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strategy also involves the redevelopment of Dandenong railway station. Dandenong railway station is a transport hub in the region, but the area is decrepit and there have been concerns regarding drug use and vandalism. Further station improvements will also occur along the Pakenham line through the Narre Warren and Berwick stations. Through this project we will see public transport finally become a realistic choice for many residents in that growth corridor. They will have trains on a regular basis, they will have facilities that are worthy of patronage and those facilities will be safe and secure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On from that, there is an urban land authority development site at Lyndhurst. That project will involve high density housing development, innovative design concepts and linkages to the public transport improvements that I mentioned earlier. A coordinated development with both housing and transport is involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to building better cities, making sure there are communities within those cities that are viable and attractive for people to live in, and ensuring effective land use to try and avoid as much as possible the urban sprawl which characterises many of Australian cities are the sorts of initiatives that need to be trialled, checked out and used as examples of what can be done in the wider sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is really annoying about this, I suppose, from a local member's point of view and also from the federal government's point of view is the fact that the state government in Victoria&mdash;and, I understand, in many other states&mdash;is endeavouring to claim this program as its own. The program would not have taken place without federal government money. The program is one where the state is often providing in kind assistance, for example, the land where the railway lines will go. Yet, whenever we see developments on these programs in the local area we see the local state minister, Alan Brown, announcing them. We see local state members of parliament claiming the credit for them, at one time crying poor and saying that they have no money and at the next stage coming along and saying, `Isn't this wonderful' and, if we are lucky, giving a short acknowledgment of federal government involvement. I think that is unfair and practically dishonest and not something that the government should tolerate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to a program which, unfortunately, was abolished in the last budget but which I will be pushing to have reinstated in the coming budget; that is, the black spot prevention program. Two particular black spots in my electorate were funded prior to the election and the constructions have since been completed. One was a set of boom gates at the railway crossing in Dandenong South on Greens Road, which is part of the railway line which will form the better cities electrification of the Cranbourne line. It is an area where, from February 1987 to December 1992, there was a total of 16 reported accidents. One person was killed and 15 were injured, nine of them seriously. It is obviously an intersection which required that sort of correction in terms of traffic control. The other correction was the Camms Road-South Gippsland Highway traffic lights. This crossroad has been the scene of 26 car accidents in the past six years. While there have been no fatalities, 18 people have been injured, three of them seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the development of growth corridors and the development of new suburbs, we see that these sorts of initiatives are important because as they grow, as the traffic levels increase and as the speed increases, more and more accidents occur. It is incumbent on all levels of government to address those issues in whatever ways they can in terms of their responsibilities. As I said earlier, this is an important program. It is a program I support fully, and I believe this government should be moving to reinstate it in the coming budget process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about the role of government in the local area, we also talk about government services. By government services I mean government offices that provide services for the people in those areas. Cranbourne has suffered from being a satellite, if you like, of Dandenong, or Frankston, depending on which way you approach it, and it is an area which has lacked government services. The lack of public transport has also made it more difficult for the residents of Cranbourne to access those services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two initiatives were announced prior to the election, on which I am pleased to inform the House of further action. The first one was a new CES office for Cranbourne. Cranbourne residents formerly had to go to Frankston or Dandenong to access CES services and, in a time of high unemployment, that was not appropriate or fair to those residents. At the time of the election, announcements were made regarding a job centre being provided. It would deal strictly with actual job vacancies and have limited scope for additional support services on site. That was important, but at the same time it was not sufficient, in my view. Since the election we have had a further development. This has now been upgraded to include not only a job centre but also an industry services centre, a special services centre and a youth access centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry services centre will provide direct support to local industry, helping to ensure that their particular needs are met, for example, designing specific assistance programs and organising placements as required. The special services centre will provide support for the long-term unemployed by specific assistance in terms of job referrals, counselling, assessment and programs such as job skills. The youth access centre will provide similar services targeted particularly at the young, which is a growing group in that area and a group that is particularly disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the election campaign, the then social security minister, the former member for Bonython, announced that a Cranbourne DSS office would be funded in that financial year. That funding has since been confirmed; however, again, at the time only a local office was proposed. Now, instead of a local office, we are moving towards a regional office. Whereas a local office would have meant many DSS clients would still need to attend the Dandenong office for a number of DSS services, the new office will provide the full range of services in Cranbourne. The new office is scheduled to open around early 1995 and will incorporate the department's new open plan office structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, people in Cranbourne have to travel to Dandenong to attend a DSS office. As Cranbourne is a major growth area, this new office makes good sense. The new office structure represents a revolutionary approach for dealing with clients. It does away with the old stand-up counter approach used by the DSS for years. The open plan office will incorporate sit-down interview facilities and a far more comfortable waiting area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past, criticisms have been made that DSS offices were dreary places where client confidentiality was poor. By allocating more space to the public contact area, the open plan office ensures confidentiality by utilising one-on-one interview facilities. More staff will also be allocated to the public contact area, which will lead to greater efficiency in the processing of clients' needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of these new types of offices are already operating, and from all reports clients readily approve of the changes. The whole atmosphere is friendlier and more receptive to people's needs. A trip to the DSS should not be a dehumanising experience. People who need to access the services of the Department of Social Security should be extended dignity, respect and, above all, privacy. This new office will help achieve those aims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to a more controversial area which may involve some interaction with the opposition members present: the community, sport and recreational facilities grants. Three major grants were made in the area of Corinella. The first was an extension to the Cranbourne Senior Citizens Centre which will be opening, I think, in the next month. Cranbourne, as I have said, is an area of massive growth. Although this has not been principally elderly people, with the growth has come more elderly citizens and that centre is bursting at its seams. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the election campaign I attended the centre with the former honourable member for Bonython to discuss DSS type concerns with the residents of that centre. The only issue they wanted to talk to us about was the question of when the money would be made available to have their centre extended. Their principal concern was with the council, which is part-funding it with us, in terms of the lead time it would take for it to construct the centre. In my two years as being active both as a candidate and as the member for Corinella, this was probably the most heartfelt meeting I have attended regarding the concerns of the local community. Those people were desperate for the development of that centre, they could illustrate clearly a need for it and they were fully supported by local government in the area. If ever a project was worthy of consideration and funding, this project was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, there was a major gym hall and community facility at Hampton Park Secondary College on which construction is due to commence soon. Hampton Park is a growing area full of young families, and there is absolutely nothing for kids to do. It is a joint development with the private sector. It will provide better school facilities, with access to the community after hours by a private management system. Once again, there is no doubt that this facility is required, it is demanded by the people of Hampton Park and it is certainly well and truly worthy of support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third was the redevelopment of the Wonthaggi Neighbourhood House in a rural part of my electorate. In the rural parts of my electorate there is a pressing need. The employment recovery which is occurring in the metropolitan parts of my electorate is not occurring in the rural areas at this time. Wonthaggi Neighbourhood House plays a crucial support role to many disadvantaged residents of Wonthaggi and surrounding towns, including parts of the electorate of the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), which is a National Party area. Once again, this is a project clearly worthy of support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to school funding, on the tertiary, secondary and primary levels in my area. I would like to speak, firstly, about the recently announced Cranbourne TAFE College. An amount of $5 million has been earmarked for the project by the federal government. The funds for the project will provide jobs and go towards the completion of new buildings and facilities. Work on the new businesses and services facilities at Dandenong TAFE Cranbourne campus is scheduled to begin in 1996. The funds to build a new facility were provided through the Australian National Training Authority, an advisory body established last year to provide more training places and strengthen the country's training system. An amount of $200,000 will be provided in the second half of 1995, with a further $3.2 million and $1.6 million in 1996 and 1997 respectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cranbourne as a local government area is in crying need of tertiary education facilities. We have&mdash;and it is shown through the statistics&mdash;the lowest participation rate in higher education of any local government area in Victoria. This TAFE college is essential to give local residents the opportunity to access tertiary education and put them in a position where they will be better able to contest the job market in the years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further on from that was the announcement made of a new campus for Monash University at Berwick. A total of $11 million has been allocated over 1994-95 to assist Monash in this development. This $11 million is in addition to $40.1 million allocated to Monash over the 1994-96 triennium for capital purposes. Monash will develop the Berwick campus as a component of an integrated network of campuses in the eastern half of Victoria, with a particular focus on the south-eastern growth area. The campus will be developed to provide facilities for on-campus teaching as well as serving as a hub for a multicampus delivery network involving the electronic linking of all Monash campuses. Monash has agreed to commit at least $9 million of its federal funding to construct teaching staff and support facilities at the site, with a further $2 million to be spent on the facilitation of multicampus delivery networks in the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn, finally, to the question of funding to non-government and state schools in the primary and secondary area. I will not go through the details, but over $2 million in the last 12 months has been granted to non-government schools in the Cranbourne-Corinella area because it is a growing area and there is a crying need for these facilities. It has provided new classrooms, new libraries and technology facilities, which have been widely applauded by the local community. The one concern that has come up&mdash;and this relates more, I guess, to the state government&mdash;is why we are putting money into non-government schools but not into state schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have a situation where the state government has basically been misleading the Victorian public about what has been happening. The federal government has pumped millions of dollars into government schools in the shire of Cranbourne and more than half a million dollars more than the state government over the last three years. The figures from the director of school education show that in the years 1990 to 1993 inclusive the Commonwealth spent $8,306,100 on major works in government schools in the shire of Cranbourne. This compares with $7.624 million provided by the state government. Commonwealth funds are given to the state governments and administered by them. There are very broad guidelines which the states must adhere to. But generally it is up to the discretion of the states as to what areas and which schools the money is spent on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak tonight on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4). In 1966 Professor Geoffrey Blainey wrote a book called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Tyranny of Distance</EMPHASIS> in which he talked about how distance shaped the history of Australia. In that book he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Innovations which had come slowly over many years in the northern hemisphere were telescoped into a few years in Australia. The long era in which distance was a tyrant seemed suddenly, but mistakenly, to be fading away.</PARA>
<PARA>Those fluctuating fortunes have reaped another tyranny on this country&mdash;the tyranny of fuel taxes on the vast ribbons of road that traverse the continent. Just as a preamble, the estimated value of our road system in Australia is said to be approximately $100 billion. This asset has been paid for from the hard-won earnings of the Australian taxpayers. Any good property manager will confirm that it would be a gross dereliction of duty to own such a substantial asset and not make provision for its proper maintenance and care. That is exactly what the federal government is not doing&mdash;properly maintaining and caring for our federal road system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a vast continent where transport is paramount to our economic wellbeing, an increase in fuel tax&mdash;a tax that hits all road users, both domestic and commercial&mdash;is a great imposition. But, to rub salt into the wound, the federal government hives off a vast percentage of that tax to general revenue. This latest increase of tax on fuel is nothing more than a blatant grab for more cash from a government that has considerable difficulty in managing the budgetary concerns of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To add insult to injury on the fuel tax grab, the federal government's task force on regional development has proposed a new national petrol tax. The task force, chaired by Bill Kelty, suggests that motorists would accept a higher tax if the extra money raised was spent on roads. Back in the early 1980s a new tax was imposed on petrol to fund the bicentennial and other road projects. Little of that now goes to road funding, so why should anyone in our community believe that this further Kelty tax would be spent on roads?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This outrageous proposal to levy further imposts just underscores the cavalier attitude of this government towards the taxpayers and the management of this country's financial affairs. The situation is that the federal government is set to raise an estimated $8.5 billion in 1993-94 through the indexation of a fuel tax. This is a dramatic rise from a nearly $1.4 billion tax raised in 1982-83. We might say that everything has gone up&mdash;and everything has gone up, that is true. But it is the relativity between the increase in tax and the decline in dollars spent on roads in Australia which is so alarming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1982-83 federal road funding amounted to 62 per cent of that revenue. By 1993-94 that ratio has dropped to 12 per cent and will fall to less than nine per cent according to forward estimates for 1996-97. Mr David West, Chief Executive of the Royal Automobile Club in Perth, said of the task force:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Taskforce has ignored the damage done to Australia's transport networks by the Government's continued failure to give road funding a fair share of the considerable revenue already raised from motorists.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new fuel tax will simply be another unjustified burden on motorists and increase transport costs in regional areas which already suffer from their remoteness and reliance on transport.</PARA>
<PARA>The increase in taxes and the decrease in funding has affected every state in Australia. Not one state is not moving into a downward trend in terms of the amount of money allocated to road funding. My own electorate of Pearce and, in particular, my own state of Western Australia has suffered a savage cutback in road funding. On the basis that Western Australia has 25 per cent of the length of national highways, at least 10.7 per cent of Commonwealth fuel tax collections, 9.5 per cent of the population, and 12 per cent of the national heavy haulage operating out of Western Australia, these figures do not convert very well in terms of fairness and equity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the figures in dollar terms. Fuel excise revenue contributed by Western Australia amounts to more than $700 million and Western Australia will receive back only $77.1 million in road funding this financial year. That equates to a miserly seven per cent of the total national highway funding. To arrive at its so-called equitable position the government applies its `model' for determining funding. It conveniently overlooks the fact that many of our national highways are in remote areas&mdash;Western Australia being a particularly good example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Isolated though they may be, these highways carry our vast mineral wealth to markets creating enormous revenue for the Commonwealth that all Australians share in. The wealth generated in Western Australia by mining, oil, gas and gold all contribute to the national economy. What my state wants is a better deal from the Commonwealth, starting with a fair ratio of fuel tax collections against revenue for allocation to road funding. As I mentioned before, no diligent asset manager would put a $100 billion asset at risk by failing to maintain it or provide the funds to maintain it; the ongoing maintenance of the existing national highways must be a funding priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to upgrading of the existing national highway system, the expansion of the present national highway system is a necessity in any sensible approach to a federal road funding program. Geoffrey Blainey wrote how distance shaped Australia's history. Distance may well shape Australia's economic wellbeing and with it the future of most Australians. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that road transport carries 80 per cent of freight in Australia and directly employs more than 100,000 people and another 300,000 people indirectly. It operates in a vast variety of conditions throughout Australia, from local distribution tasks to the enormous road trains of the outback. My colleague the shadow minister for transport, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) highlighted this in a media release late last year when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is unfortunate that the Government's commitment to raising the standard in the most immediate sense&mdash;by the provision of a good and safe road infrastructure&mdash;has waned. The Federal Government's commitment to road funding has fallen this financial year (1993/94) to below the level of 1982/83 in actual terms. In real terms the decline is far more severe.</PARA>
<PARA>It is scandalous that this government is doing nothing to address the nation's short- or long-term road funding crisis. The issues at stake are many. There is the safety of everyday motorists, the commercial carriers' efficiency and the ongoing viability of our business sector to make a financial contribution to the nation. There is also the growing tourist numbers. We spend vast sums on attracting tourists but we do not have the infrastructure in place to accommodate their motoring and transport requirements and under this government we will not get that infrastructure. There is also the matter of ripping off motorists by way of a petrol tax without allocating back a fair and reasonable amount for road improvements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) has a great opportunity to show the Australian people that he can come to grips with this important national issue. I was pleased to hear my colleague across the room, the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Griffin), talk about the black spots program. The Minister for Transport could start by seeking an appropriation of funds to reinstate the black spots program which was dropped in the 1993-94 budget. Unquestionably, this program made a major contribution to road safety with some benefits in the employment sector. When this program was first budgeted for, the then Minister assisting the Treasurer, in his second reading speech on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3), said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This program (the Black Spot Programme) is a cost effective initiative to significantly improve safety standards at sites with a history of traffic accidents. In addition to improving the safety standards on Australia's road system, this increase in expenditure will create new employment opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA>The government boasted that the program would save 220 lives per annum and now the black spots program has been unceremoniously dumped. According to the Royal Automobile Club of Western Australia, the elimination of black spots is a cost effective way of improving road safety. Initial federal studies showed a reduction of more than 50 per cent in crashes. In Western Australia an evaluation by the Main Roads Department of more than half of the black spot sites showed that a treatment cost of $6.5 million resulted in reduced accident savings of about $60 million. That was the first year after the road improvements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Motorists will be compromised and lives will be lost as motorists continue to pay higher and higher taxes on fuel, vehicles and spare parts. This must stop and I call on the government to start the process of turning around its appalling record since coming to office in 1983 and to reinstate the black spots program and return to our roads the money necessary to maintain and improve them and to ensure the proper management of a valuable national asset and the safety of all Australians and tourists to our country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to come to grips with this national issue it will be through a cooperative effort between the states and the Commonwealth. I have complete sympathy with the Prime Minister's stated objective in last night's speech at the Australian National University when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the coming decade, I'd like to see a new relationship with the states involved based on four principles. The first of these is that we recognise that the States have a vital role as units of government in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>A little further in his speech he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And the fourth principle is that while the Commonwealth believes the states should be adequately resourced, it should be taken as understood that the Commonwealth will not be party to any substantial transfer of Commonwealth taxing powers to the States. Now within those four principles we have the opportunity to cooperatively develop, I think a new commitment, if you like a new consensus, a new understanding between the Commonwealth and the States about how to make these important areas of microeconomic change.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister must go beyond the rhetoric and match his stated ideals with some practical solutions. It is not good enough that the state premiers are forced to grovel in the dust like a bunch of poverty stricken peasants for a few crumbs off his heavily laden table. State bashing has to stop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Meaningful dialogue between the states and the Commonwealth would be a good starting point and the minister for roads might pick up a point or two from his Western Australian counterpart, Mr Eric Charlton. Since coming to office only 12 months ago, he has ensured that Western Australia has become the only state to direct all federal untied money into road programs and he has increased the allocation of funds from state resources by a huge 34 per cent. This allocation has been made by virtue of efficient management of the public sector transport system and without any diminution of services. It is not a matter of saying, as the Prime Minister stated, that the states' idea of cooperation is just a question of handing over more money. It is a question of giving to the states what is rightfully their share of revenue to use for what is constitutionally their responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal government has busied itself trying to interfere with education, social policy, health, the environment, and economic policy. It has even taken to usurping the role of parents via the youth homeless allowance, without any ongoing responsibility or coordination with the states. It is time the Prime Minister and his ministers recognised their limitations and set about concentrating on the issues of national importance that they can fix, doing their job well and not meddling in all of the other areas that they seem hell-bent on taking on. Their passion for self-exaltation and grandiose schemes smacks of the very megalomania that the Prime Minister seeks to distance himself from, as quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 14 February 1994.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the adjournment debate on 13 November 1990, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and I spoke very strongly about the need for a royal commission in Western Australia. This happened to be on the occasion of the tabling of a sensational report in the Legislative Council of the Western Australian parliament by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administrative Investigations&mdash;in other words, the parliamentary ombudsman. He delivered a blockbuster report to the Legislative Council and called for a royal commission with extended powers&mdash;as was the case with the Fitzgerald inquiry&mdash;to investigate matters raised in the revelations contained in documents that were seized from Robert Smith, private investigator, who at that time was gaoled for bugging offences under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act. It took longer than a week for the then Premier of Western Australia to be dragged, screaming, to a royal commission. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 21 November 1990, under a title of `Right Decision for Grubby Reason', editorialised:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Had Dr Lawrence been brave enough, when appointed Premier of Western Australia in February, to order a royal commission into political and business corruption, she would have won considerable credit. She could have expected the sort of kudos earned by Mr Mike Ahern when, as Queensland Premier, he set up the Fitzgerald commission to deal with allegations against a government of his own party. But Dr Lawrence showed no similar determination. When speed would have helped restore confidence in Western Australia's political and business processes, she chose the course of the delay trick. Her initial response to calls for a royal commission, made on the first day she took office, was to cite the Costigan inquiry into the failed financier, Rothwells Ltd, claiming one would pre-empt findings of the other . . . commented that only last week she answered demands for a royal commission by citing the advice of the Commission of Police, Brian Bull, who claimed such an inquiry would probably impede police investigations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now Dr Lawrence has changed her mind with a swiftness that is surprising and a stated rationale that is perplexing. The switch raises serious questions about whether her decision is an attempt to investigate corruption allegations or just another grubby exercise aimed at dispersing the spotlight of scandal so that it includes the ALP's political opponents as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In trying to justify her about-face, Dr Lawrence maintains that in the past fortnight, for the first time, claims of political corruption have been made and they attack the core of our democratic process. Her view seems to be that, despite the outstanding allegations made since the WA Inc. scandal was first disclosed, there has been little that is specific.</PARA>
<PARA>History has shown what futile words they were. It is my submission that the lateness of the calling of the Western Australian royal commission into WA Inc. impeded the opportunity for the vast millions of dollars to be either identified or recovered. Even her own minister for justice, now the opposition spokesman for justice, Mr Smith, called only recently for the NCA to investigate the money that is still missing from the Western Australian royal commission. In comments that have been made as a consequence of those remarks, it has been pointed out that there is little evidence around to track it down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that, in contrast to this image of the Premier of Western Australia, Dr Lawrence, being somebody who rushed to form a royal commission in Western Australia to look into these scandals to try to find out where all this money had gone as a result of all these bungles made by the Western Australian government, she did no such thing. She had to be dragged screaming to a royal commission. It was only thanks to the outrage that was expressed by a combination of the ombudsman, the Western Australian Liberal Party and the media that she made that decision at all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of this government's outstanding achievements has been the better targeting and scope of Australia's income support system. This nation's egalitarian values should always be reflected in the maintenance of a compassionate and effective safety net for those who require public assistance. The limited scope of government resources makes essential the targeting of welfare measures to those most in need. There are, however, several areas of public policy where equity issues have not been fully addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national government, in my assessment, has a role to play in rationalising the means by which state pricing policies transfer large hidden subsidies to high income earners. The wealthiest customers of state authorities are also the largest customers of electricity, gas and water, thereby enjoying the greatest benefit from partial cost pricing. Just as much, Australia's housing system and the appearance of a housing shortage show how hidden subsidies are too often transferred to those least in need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In cities such as Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide there are nearly as many bedrooms as there are people. The talk of a housing crisis is actually a question of distribution and the way government subsidies have overlooked the needs of private rental households. The national housing strategy has documented how private rental housing receives the smallest amount of government support per household even though it has the greatest number of households in poverty. It has brought these matters to the attention of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) and they are now under government review. I look forward to a more equitable outcome of the distribution of those subsidies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The housing strategy found that, on the annual value of housing subsidies and tax concessions in Australia, home owners received $1,200 per household, home purchasers $1,330, public tenants $1,800 and private tenants just $300. The Commonwealth-state housing agreement should develop a funding and administrative system by which, on the basis of means testing, private housing tenants receive as much government support as public tenants. The agreement, in my assessment, should also face up to the failure of state housing authorities to take an interest in urban renewal and community development. At Holsworthy, which adjoins my electorate and is part of the electorate of the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Tickner), the Defence Housing Authority has shown how a shift to private ownership and basic housing, street and landscaping improvements can transform the quality of life in these estates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is one thing that this government can do and the Deputy Prime Minister's housing strategy can achieve, it is to target public housing estates for a transformation in the quality of life. We cannot go on neglecting the poor planning outcomes of the 1960s and 1970s, the run-down in housing stock and the way in which we need to turn around some of the aspects of lifestyle that have been neglected by state authorities for so long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the recently completed Liverpool housing study in my electorate has recommended how similar cooperation and results can be achieved between the New South Wales department of housing and local government authorities. This has the potential to produce substantial benefits for the Glenquarie, Minto, Airds and Claymore housing estates in my electorate. The federal government will find no better way of building better cities than providing financial support for these projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This demonstrates an important point about the support role of government. The most successful public programs are those which empower the disadvantaged to take greater control of their own lives. My experience in local government has reinforced how the work of government is made doubly difficult without a sense of ownership, control and community pride. Any amount of self-sufficiency among disadvantaged groups will always achieve much more than welfare dependency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These issues have great relevance in the electorate of Werriwa because they featured in the recent by-election campaign. The Liberal candidate for Werriwa tried to label and stereotype some of the public housing estates in the Campbelltown local government area, most regrettably by putting the label of ghetto on them. Admittedly, these areas have their problems, but I think there is a great responsibility for all people in public life to understand that we should be talking about solutions instead of trying to add to the stereotypes and labels that have been too much a feature of media comment in Sydney's south-west. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This makes a very important difference between the ALP and the Liberal Party. We do not look down our noses at people in public housing estates. We do not talk down to them. We do not try to put them down in that fashion. We are about some of the positive solutions that can make a difference. I trust that the matters I have outlined tonight in this adjournment debate will be picked up by the Deputy Prime Minister to show that solutions are at hand. It is possible to work with state and local government authorities to do a lot better than the labels and very unfair stereotypes suggested by those in the Liberal Party.

While it might be hard for a Labor mate from New South Wales to oppose his own tribe, he must reaffirm his commitment to restructuring the health system and resist the pressure from his own party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason the minister should do this is simple, and it is not driven by any reason other than plain economic fact: the private health system saves the government $2 1/2 billion a year; it pays the hospital bills for four out of every 10 Australians. The government clearly benefits from private health insurance. An expansion in the numbers of people with private health insurance and a greater utilisation of the bed capacity of private hospitals will only save the government money and create more room in an overcrowded public sector. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consumers of private health cover enjoy obvious advantages, and when their number expands even those without health insurance benefit from the reduced amount on the services in the public sector. The Liberal Party has continued to endorse the use of tax incentives to encourage Australians, particularly lower income earners, to take up private health insurance for all these reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the decade to June last year, the number of people with private health insurance dropped from 70 per cent to about 40 per cent. At this rate of decline it has been estimated that the figure will fall another 10 per cent by 1998. However, at the same time, the figures released by the Australian Health Insurance Association suggest that 66 per cent of Australians who do not have private health insurance would join a health fund if incentives were introduced. Groups like the Consumer Health Forum have argued that tax rebates for private insurance unsettle the tax base. They have claimed that rebates redistribute wealth from the less well off and the ones who suffer the most from poor health to the wealthy. However, it could be argued just as strongly that the behaviour of high income earners like the Prime Minister, who fail to take out private health insurance and who draw on scarce community resources, is equally regressive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument for private health insurance should not be seen in purely ideological terms. If the decline in the number of people without health insurance is not reversed, we will see horrendously long waiting lists for elective surgery, overcrowding of public wards and a gradual diminishing of service overall. The public health zealots will have triumphed in creating a system with no equity at all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I bring to the attention of the House this evening a clear issue of the double standards in the application of the income tax law. A 10-year tax bungle that involves thousands of dollars of tax having been overpaid by retiring police officers in New South Wales has in fact extended to a range of New South Wales government employees, including the Maritime Services Board employees as well. But tonight I am specifically talking about tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that if we owe the Commissioner of Taxation $100, he will pursue us up hill and down dale forever to get that money. But here we have a case where police officers retired. The analysis of their lump sum on retirement and the balance of their payment was calculated in error and they were heavily overtaxed. They knew nothing of this until quite some years later. For many of them the three-year deadline was 1986 and they did not object to their assessment by 1986 so they are debarred by taxation law from gaining a refund of the tax that they had overpaid in innocence. So the contrast is: if we owe the tax commissioner, he will get us; but if the tax commissioner owes us, we cannot get him. For these retired persons&mdash;men getting up in their higher years&mdash;as each year passes by, the money goes down in value, the commissioner has a free loan of it, inflation takes its toll on it, and the men's opportunity to use it becomes less and less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I brought this matter to the attention of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear). I brought it to the attention first of the Australian Taxation Office. It correctly said that the Income Tax Assessment Act preclude it from making a refund because the date for objection has passed. I then took it to the Assistant Treasurer and he told me what I expected he would tell me&mdash;the same thing. But the Taxation Office did take it to the Department of Finance and asked it to make an act of grace payment. The response of the Department of Finance was that the Audit Act 1901 allows act of grace payments only where there is evidence of Commonwealth maladministration. In this case, it was maladministration by the New South Wales police force in providing the wrong information on group certificates. As the Commonwealth government was not involved in maladministration, the department chose not to recommend any act of grace payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further advice from the Taxation Office has informed me that other provisions within the Audit Act 1901 would enable act of grace payments to be recommended. The upshot is that these former police officers and other state government employees have been heavily overtaxed. In one case, the gentleman had $1,700 taken from him. There is another case of $1,000. They are not small amounts of money; they are substantial amounts of money. Honourable members can visualise what the taxation commissioner would be doing if these people still owed, for example, $1,700 in tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the commissioner has the money. He says he cannot pay it out because the tax act does not let him. The Department of Finance will not recommend it because it has chosen a particular interpretation of the Audit Act 1901, which I believe to be a faulty interpretation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I bring this matter to the attention of the House on behalf of my constituents and all state government employees in New South Wales who have suffered under incorrect information. I ask the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) to look at this issue very seriously and ensure that there is provision within the Audit Act 1901 to enable prompt refunds to be made to these taxpayers. If he still thinks it cannot be done, the taxation act should be amended very promptly so that these people can get back the money that has been owed to them since, in these cases, 1983 and 1984. I hope that both ministers involved&mdash;the Assistant Treasurer and the Minister for Finance&mdash;will give this request their very prompt and favourable consideration. </PARA>

I have not yet received a response to that question, but I presume it will be in the pipeline shortly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I received this week further correspondence from some people in Port Macquarie. They represent a number of my constituents who are concerned about the equity in the provision of these services between the metropolitan areas and the regional areas in particular of New South Wales. At this point, I note that I did hear&mdash;I do not know whether it is rumour or fact&mdash;that SBS television will soon become available in the rural areas of north-west Tasmania. If that is the case, I ask the minister whether he is also planning to do something about the mid north coast and the north coast of New South Wales.

<PARA>That situation is the provision of SBS television services to the mid north coast. These are two people out of a number of constituents who have lobbied me and asked me to make representations on their behalf to the Minister for Communications and the Arts on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Taree, there is a group called the SBS Group for the Mid North Coast. Over a number of years, it has been talking with the Department of Communications about trying to provide this service to our area. It is an area which, from the mast on Middle Brother Mountain, would probably service 100,000 people or more. This group in Taree has taken it upon itself to raise funds privately to buy its own transmitter and to establish it on a high point in the Taree area. That will only service about 40,000 people. The point is that it is raising private funds to buy this transmitter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the early stages of its negotiations with the government department&mdash;it was with whichever the preceding authority was prior to the establishment of the National Transmission Authority&mdash;it asked whether it could establish its own transmitter on the mast on Middle Brother Mountain. The answer was yes. The rental that was suggested was about $1,500 a year. Its members then said, `We'll cost out what it will cost the community to buy this equipment to establish its own SBS service'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They came back and found that they were now dealing with one of the government's new GBEs, the National Transmission Authority. I have not got to the stage of finding out its community service obligations and to what extent the government funds them, but when they went back and said, `We want to put our own transmitter which we will buy on the mast that is under your control on Middle Brother Mountain west of Laurieton', they were told by the National Transmission Authority that the cost of renting the space on the tower was not going to be $1,500 a year but $25,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This group, which is raising funds within the local community, could not afford that amount and had to seek another site where it could put its transmitter. It did that through one of the local utilities. It is on a high point in the area which will service the majority of the Manning Valley community. Before this group purchased its equipment it wanted to test whether it could redirect the signal into the local area and what its success rate would be. We contacted the National Transmission Authority to see whether it would do a test of this new location before this group, with private funds, bought its new transmitter. The authority said, `No. Go jump. You do it yourself. You buy your transmitter. You go and do your own testing'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have this government, through its government business enterprise, the National Transmission Authority, saying that it will not assist in testing a site for this private group which wants to provide a service to the Manning Valley community on the mid-north coast that should be provided by this government. It is starting to recognise the importance of regional development, and the provision of communication services is a most important aspect of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I call for an enquiry into the bank rip-offs that are taking place in this country. An independent government enquiry must be urgently initiated into banks ripping off their investors. The federal government must take appropriate action to prevent banks from taking advantage of defenceless investors due to the big four banks' total monopoly on interest rates. Recent figures produced by the OECD to September 1993 confirm that Australia is now charging the second highest margin in the world. In fact, the margin charged by banks has, in the last twelve months, ripped off Australians by more than $790 million. As banks have grown their profit margin has grown from 3.8 per cent to 4.4 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is truly amazing that in the midst of a recession the profits of the big four banks, that is, the NAB, ANZ, Westpac and the Commonwealth, have turned around from a loss of just under $400 million last year to a profit of over $4 billion, even after writing off some $5 billion in bad loans and carrying some $17 billion in non-performing debts. It has also been seen over the last twelve months that the NAB profit increased by 67 per cent to $1.3 billion, apart from the massive turnaround of a $1.6 billion profit recorded by Westpac to 30 September 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question must be asked: how can a massive loss be turned into a resounding profit in such a short period without being at the expense of defenceless Australian investors who cannot compel banks to reduce their excessive margins? A disgusting position exists with pensioners now forced to dig into their limited remaining capital merely to survive. By the time pensioners pay bank and government duties, they are likely to be earning no more than 3 per cent on their money.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small businesses are paying a ridiculous premium to the banks. This is leading to more and more unemployment. Moreover, small businesses and farmers are being charged an even higher premium than the base lending rate. Essentially, bank margins are frustrating the emergence of the housing and business market from recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has a responsibility, as does the chairman of the banking industry, to create controls on bank lending margins as investors are defenceless to take on the monopoly that exists among the big four banks. Naturally, they invest with the major banks as they know they are guaranteed by the government of the day. Also, a serious perception of banks exists wherein individuals are obsessed about paying off their bank loans as quickly as possible. Often they do not properly manage for their retirement by setting aside their own contribution moneys into superannuation, apart from what their employers must compulsorily provide, as they are petrified of banks foreclosing on their properties. In addition, from a small business perspective, they are concerned to retire debt as banks keep criticising small businesses saying that they are not making enough profits and have insufficient retained earnings. Therefore, small businesses believe they are compelled to clear up existing debts due to their lack of confidence in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If talented and skilled individuals do not commence their own businesses, a tremendous drain and loss of intellectual skill and talent will occur in Australia.

Also, many individuals will go and work for large companies and never truly develop personal skills that are only brought to fruition by their running their own stand-alone businesses.
