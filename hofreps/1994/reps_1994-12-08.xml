<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, it is good to see you in the chair while this important legislation is being debated. When the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) was making his second reading speech on these bills yesterday, he made the comment that they represent something of a landmark in the history of Commonwealth financial administration. It was very true and very correct of the minister to say that, because they replace the Audit Act 1901. Probably no more important legislation can ever be debated in this place than that relating to financial accountability. The public rightly expects and deserves public accountability to be the highest priority of members of the parliament and of the Commonwealth of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is certainly a pleasure for me to have the opportunity to comment on this package of legislation which will replace the Audit Act 1901. This legislation will form a cornerstone of the Commonwealth's system of financial accountability and will set in place the financial arrangements to see the Commonwealth into the next century. As you, Mr Speaker, would be aware, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which I am pleased to have the opportunity to chair, has been closely involved in the consultative process, culminating in the government amendments that have been proposed to the bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, during the debate on this legislation, the member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) and the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) in particular made some rather interesting comments revolving around a lot of the recommendations from our committee. The committee's report No. 331 was the result of this legislation having been referred to us. I think that, in itself, is another landmark. Legislation is now being referred to committees of parliament. This was the first legislation that was referred to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, and it is also the most important legislation, as I said, we will ever debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that report we came up with some 39 recommendations. Understandably, and probably in some ways we are a little disappointed, the government has not accepted all our recommendations, but it certainly has accepted a lot of them&mdash;I think something like 70 per cent to 75 per cent of them. Thirty-five recommendations refer particularly to these bills and another four refer to the Audit Committee of Parliament, which is a separate matter in itself but I will comment on it later. I am particularly pleased that a lot of those recommendations have been picked up, while, at the same time, I am a little disappointed that some of the other ones have not been accepted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we need to bear in mind the process that we go through in referring bills to committees. I would encourage it as much as we can. At the end of the day, we have better legislation now than that which we started with. When the minister first referred this to the committee, his comments were pretty important. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have indicated, virtually by implication in the things that I have been saying, the government is not so proud of its authorship in this regard that it is going to take umbrage at getting additional advice from any sources and we look forward to the consultative processes yet in hand.</PARA>
<PARA>Similarly, I would suggest that our committee is not the custodian of all wisdom either. We have had the opportunity to look through this legislation. I do not think it would be expected that all our recommendations would be accepted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has obviously gone through them and considered them in depth and has come back with the amendments that it has put up. The government has put forward 42 amendments to the three pieces of legislation. The government has instigated some of the amendments itself. They have come out of some of the findings of, and people's contributions to, our committee rather than coming from the recommendations. I think that is a pretty important aspect that has come across. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to turn to some of the amendments that the opposition has put forward. I believe all our recommendations are important, but I would like to reflect on the ones that have not been accepted by the government&mdash;that is, the appointment of the Auditor-General and the Audit Committee of Parliament. In relation to the appointment of the Audit Committee of Parliament, we wanted greater involvement by the parliament through the Public Accounts Committee. Instead of having consultation between the minister, the Leader of the Opposition or his nominee and the chair of the Public Accounts Committee, we felt that it would be better to seek the full role of the Public Accounts Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think that was meant as a sleight against me. I supported it quite strongly. I thought that having the collective wisdom of the whole committee was better than just having my own individual views as a chairperson. I felt that would have been helpful. Whilst we suggested that the minister should seek the approval of the Leader of the Opposition and the Public Accounts Committee, perhaps the minister should consult with the Leader of the Opposition first and then seek the approval of the Public Accounts Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have come up with that position mainly because annual reporting guidelines are approved, as you may be aware, Mr Speaker, by the Public Accounts Committee; there is a formal approval process whereby the Prime Minister refers those guidelines to the Public Accounts Committee for its formal approval. We take that particular duty of the Public Accounts Committee very seriously in the processes that we go through to ensure that those guidelines meet the requirements of the parliament. There has never been a big problem with that process. We saw a similarity between the role of the Public Accounts Committee and that proposed for the Audit Committee. That was important to our committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding that, the government has not rejected our recommendation completely out of hand; it has gone a bit further. The formation of a separate Audit Committee of Parliament is included in the motion before the Senate. The motion provides that the chairpersons of the Audit Committee will be you, Mr Speaker, and the President of the Senate. That is one of our recommendations that the government has picked up, and it is important. If we are to have a separate Audit Committee, the chair of that committee should also be consulted on the appointment of the Auditor-General. I know that gives you a big burden to carry, Mr Speaker, but I am sure you can handle it and that it will not be a problem for you. However, I feel it is important to give that status to the Audit Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Audit Committee of Parliament is a very important committee. It should be treated accordingly and given a very high status in this place&mdash;and I am sure it will be under your guidance and that of the President. One of the essential issues to which we referred in our report No. 296 back in 1989 was that there should be an audit committee of parliament. The current Public Accounts Committee did not recommend a separate audit committee of the parliament but believed that a name change to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts to include the word `audit' would have been a more appropriate course. Given the number of committees in the parliament now and the duties of members participating in those committees, it was important from our point of view that there not be too many duplications of committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Public Accounts Committee, Mr Speaker, as you well know, takes its duties very seriously. I believe that the committee has always been held in extremely high regard, and I think that is indicated by the amendments before us wherein the government has accepted a great number of our recommendations. Such is the seriousness, importance and status of our committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the JCPA could have adequately fulfilled that role. However, the government believes that those powers should be separated. I believe that comes very much out of the British model, but the situation is somewhat different in Britain. We did have the opportunity to speak to the Comptroller and Auditor-General of the UK. We did not visit him; he visited us, and we took that opportunity to discuss these aspects with him. Given the size of the British parliament compared to the size of our parliament, there is probably a greater need for a separate committee there. Also, in the British House of Commons there are 650 members compared of the 147 members in this place. Another fundamental difference is that the equivalent of the JCPA in the British parliament is chaired by a member of the opposition. That is quite different from what occurs here. However, aspects of the historicial situation in the House of Commons have been picked up in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, I respect the government's views. Through the processes, we have argued what should be done. My colleague the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) highlighted those views when he spoke yesterday. A lot of reports come before the parliament that we as members of parliament participate in the compilation of, and it is the case that you cannot always get your own way. We accept the democratic and party processes we have in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was a little disappointed yesterday when the member for Mitchell, who spoke after the member for Charlton, attacked the member for Charlton and suggested that he should cross the floor and vote to support amendments put forward by the opposition that pick up some of the recommendations the government has not accepted. That is an absolute nonsense. When the member for Forrest was speaking yesterday, he did not allude to that even though he was a bit critical of the process with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Forrest&mdash;along with you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and me&mdash;was a member of the committee which was involved with report No. 296. If people have their name on a report and things do not go their way, will they have to cross the floor to reflect their views? That would mean we would have to deal with amendments individually. If we took that course of action we would have to go through 42 amendments, which would be rather unworkable and not be a smart way to go. I was a bit disappointed when the member for Mitchell chose to attack the member for Charlton because he spoke very passionately on this legislation. The member for Charlton has played a very strong role, and even when our report was tabled here he spoke very extensively to it. I just wanted to make that point because it was rather unfortunate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to some of the amendments proposed by the opposition. I will not go through the FMA Bill and the CAC Bill; it is to the Auditor-General Bill that most of the opposition's amendments are proposed. I want to make a few comments about the Audit Committee because the opposition's amendment does not seem to meet the importance of the Audit Committee of Parliament. As I said earlier, we as a committee, and as a parliament, should see the real importance of this Audit Committee of Parliament. The government sees it as very important and believes the Presiding Officers should chair it as they will give it that extra status. That is a matter I have already dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am somewhat confused with the amendment that the member for Forrest has put forward. He suggests in his amendment that the JCPA should be the audit committee of parliament. We do not necessarily have great difficulty with that because it is what we originally recommended in report No. 331. Under the heading of `Sectional committees', proposed new clause 56 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 9 of the Principal Act is amended by inserting the following subsection after subsection (1):</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"(2)As soon as practicable after the commencement of the first session of each Parliament, the Committee must appoint a Sectional Committee, to be known as the Audit Committee, consisting of 9 of its members to perform the duties set out in paragraphs 8(1)(da)&mdash;8(1)(df).'.".</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think that fulfils the importance that our committee put on this. We suggested that the size of the JCPA be extended by one person&mdash;from 15 to 16&mdash;to accommodate the minor parties in the parliament. In that way, everyone would have the opportunity to participate. Traditionally, a committee such as the JCPA has members from the government and opposition only and not necessarily from the minor parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That fact is an important one that I think the Democrats in the other place particularly would have alluded to. Under the proposal, we recommend that the formation of the JCPA Audit Committee, as it would become known&mdash;a sectional committee of the JCPA&mdash;would lessen the importance of the Audit Committee of Parliament. I cannot come to terms with this particular amendment the opposition is proposing because it would lessen the importance of the Audit Committee. The essential things we wanted were a name change of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts to an audit committee and separate meetings when it resides as an audit committee. If the committee met as a separate audit committee, it would give it the status it rightly deserves as an extremely important committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition wants to form some sort of sectional committee with nine members. I assume the figure of nine came from the proposed audit committee that Senator Ray's notice of motion in the other place seeks to establish. It is proposed that it will have nine members, so I assume that is where the magic figure of nine came from. The member for Forrest failed to explain that to the House, so he might like to do so at a later stage. The opposition has also picked up the duties of the audit committee proposed in Senator Ray's notice of motion in the Senate. That is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always felt that the Audit Committee of Parliament should be a statutory committee rather than just a committee that is formed every parliament. That is one of the things that the government should have looked at. It may wish to consider that at a later stage. That is pretty important. I am at a bit of a loss as to why the opposition would have proposed that course of action. I do not think it picks up the requirements that our own committee wanted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, I believe the government has responded very positively to report No. 296. It has been around since 1989. Whilst it has been around for a long time&mdash;the Audit Act has been around since 1901&mdash;report No. 296 has been an important report, and our latest report is equally as important in the development of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is important legislation. The amendments that the government has put forward are important. The government has picked up so many of the recommendations of our committee. Notwithstanding the areas about which I have expressed concern, I think overall the parliament will be better for this legislation at the end of the day. Our committee is a strong supporter of the role of the audit office, and that will continue in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to turn quickly to the FMA Bill. The government has picked up a couple of points which have not stemmed from our committee recommendations. That shows the intent of the government in responding so positively to it. The importance of committees looking at legislation before it comes to this place has been demonstrated in this exercise. It is one of the more innovative things that this parliament has taken on board. I believe all legislation should be able to go through the same process. Recently, the Public Accounts Committee visited our counterparts in New Zealand. The same process happens there and it works very effectively. It is a smaller parliament by a long shot, but the process works very effectively. Our Main Committee has helped us too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this debate and support the legislation. As I said, even though it does not pick up all our recommendations, it has in the main picked up many of them, and I think the legislation is better for it. I look forward to the continuing debate on this legislation in this place and the other place. I also look forward to hearing the comments of our colleagues on the other side of the House in the course of this debate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a unique experience to have government legislation of such importance referred to our committee. We gave the bills thorough examination. We called for submissions from the public, from government agencies and from the Department of Finance. When these submissions were received by the committee, we had public hearings and people were given an opportunity to express their views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of that committee process the JCPA came up with report No. 331 and we now have stronger legislation. The committee made recommendations to the government. I think it has taken on board, either wholly or partially, something like 32 of the 39 recommendations the committee made. It was a learning process for the opposition, members of the committee, members of the government and government agencies. Those involved in drafting the bills, which were introduced into the parliament by the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), found out more about the bills through the committee process. They realised that the bills could be improved so they took on board, as I said, 32 of the 39 recommendations. The opposition will be moving a number of amendments to this legislation. These amendments ask the government to adopt those recommendations which it has not adopted so far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will concentrate today on the Auditor-General Bill. The Audit Act 1901 is being replaced by this package of three bills. Consequently, these three bills are probably the most important bills to come into this House for quite a long time. The purpose of the bills is twofold: firstly, modernisation and, secondly, accountability. In relation to modernisation it was determined that we needed to update procedures to comply with modern accounting practices, such as accrual accounting, and update the legislation to take into account rapid technology and technological change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the experiences of the 1980s, both in the private sector and with the various governments across Australia, created the demand for this legislation. The demand has come not so much from the government but from the people. The Public Accounts Committee report No. 296 was entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Auditor-General: ally of the people and parliament</EMPHASIS>. It was not an ally of the government or the executive; it was an ally of the people and the parliament. Because of the experiences of the 1980s, the people are demanding that taxpayer contributions are spent in three ways: efficiently, wisely and, most importantly, legally. They also demand that they apply equally to all people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been the experience worldwide, not just in Australia, that people question the judgment and capacity of politicians to handle the public's money. This has been the experience in the UK and the USA and many other countries. At home, the question of accountability brought down quite a few governments. In Queensland, we saw the spectacle of inquiries into corruption and the misuse of public money which brought down a government. It took that sort of pressure in Queensland to establish a public accounts committee, which was non-existent for many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the experience of the State Bank of South Australia and WA Inc., and some people questioned the Hawke government's contribution of $100 million to Ansett to prop it up during the pilots strike. We had the member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) lose her portfolio earlier this year because of sporting grants. We had the Auditor-General present to the parliament a critical report on ANL, and that has been closely looked at by the government and by the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no way to achieve efficient, legal and wise use of public funds without a strong, independent Auditor-General. What do we mean by independent; independent of what? I believe the Auditor-General should be independent of the government and the executive. It is well known that the Auditor-General has had a longstanding dispute with the executive arm of government. That is not just the present audit office; perhaps it goes as far back as 1901. When I consider what the Auditor-General told our committee he needed to achieve this independence, on balance I am inclined to come down on his side rather than the side of the government and the executive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, the Minister for Finance, in the censure motion on the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), held up a bunch of papers to our side and said, `You can't say things and you can't do things without us knowing now because of the parliamentary database, because of technology.' After the censure motion, I went back to my office and decided to access the parliamentary database. I keyed in `Centenary House'. As we know, Centenary House is the building which houses the Auditor-General. I could not bring into the chamber all the references that came from the database. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result is obvious. The audit office is locked into a lease, which escalates at nine per cent per annum, but will be funded only for increased rent at one per cent per annum. As the Auditor-General has stated in hearings of the Senate estimates committee&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>as well as the PAC&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">this leaves the Auditor-General with no other choice but to reduce staff to pay the rent. He has stated that by 1996 the office will be in a totally untenable position and will be unable to carry out its functions properly. The function of scrutinising government and looking after taxpayers' money will now be run down in order that the Auditor-General can make lease payments, which are uncommercial, to the Australian Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that action compromises the independence of the Auditor-General. In looking up other references to Centenary House&mdash;honourable members will not believe this one&mdash;I found a question on notice from my colleague the member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), who asked the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services, upon notice, the following question:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Did the CSIRO conduct a moth count for the National Capital Planning Authority at York Park, Canberra . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) What is the estimated cost of the actions . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The answer to that question on notice produced a reference to Centenary House, the building owned by the Labor Party and leased by the Auditor-General. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further study in 1993-94 is foreshadowed at an estimated cost of $5,000. The proposed grassland translocation will be undertaken as part of future landscape works on York Park. The protective fence was erected in 1992 by Civil and Civic as part of the construction of Centenary House.</PARA>
<PARA>I will not make an accusation but ask the question: was the landscaping and fencing of Centenary House carried out through a grant from CSIRO? Was it an improper use of government funds, with the beneficiary being the Australian Labor Party, under the pretext of counting moths? I cannot see the relationship. As I have said, I come down on the side of the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to look at four areas of the Auditor-General Bill. Clauses 14 and 15 allow the Auditor-General to conduct a performance audit of Commonwealth authorities and companies, except GBEs or their subsidiaries. The Auditor-General may conduct a performance audit of a GBE if both houses of parliament request the audit or if the responsible minister requests the audit. In evidence to the JCPA, the Auditor-General said he believes he should have the mandate to conduct performance audits of any Commonwealth entity, including GBEs, at any time. The JCPA recommended that the Auditor-General may conduct a performance audit of a GBE if both houses of parliament request the audit; second, if the responsible minister requests the audit; or, third, if an audit committee of parliament requests the audit. That recommendation is based on the principle that it is important that there be easier mechanisms by which parliament can directly request the Auditor-General to conduct performance audits of GBEs. The government rejected the JCPA recommendations. Clauses 14 and 15 remain unchanged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the second area of concern to the Auditor-General. The bill said that the Auditor-General is to be appointed by the Governor-General on the advice of the minister. Before making a recommendation to the Governor-General, the minister must consult the finance minister, a nominee of the Leader of the Opposition and the Chairman of the JCPA. The Auditor-General wants greater parliamentary involvement in the selection process&mdash;`parliamentary' meaning both sides and minority parties. Perhaps this would avoid his being compromised by being locked into a commitment to pay rent to the Australian Labor Party. The JCPA recommended that, before making a recommendation to the Governor-General, the minister must seek the approval of, as distinct from consultation with, the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives or his or her nominee, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and an Audit Committee of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the government amendments. The reference to the Audit Committee of Parliament has been accepted. The finance minister is still to be consulted. The Leader of the Opposition, the Chairman of the JCPA and the chairperson of the Audit Committee do not have the right of approval requested by the committee. The minister will still need only to consult them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I turn to the third area of concern. There is no reference in the Auditor-General Bill to the Audit Committee. A separate Audit Committee is to be established under a notice of motion moved by Senator Robert Ray. As the member for Oxley mentioned, this was a major area of concern. We felt that the Audit Committee, like the JCPA, which is one of the few statutory committees, should also be established by statute, not by a resolution of the House. The government rejected the recommendations of the PAC. It made reference to the Audit Committee in the Auditor-General Bill and is to be consulted on appointment of the Auditor-General and Independent Auditor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The fourth area of concern was staff terms and conditions of the ANAO. The bill said that the ANAO is to be a statutory organisation and that staff are to be employed under the Public Service Act 1922. The Auditor-General wanted, in terms of independence and to attract the type of person who can conduct proper auditing work in today's modern times, the freedom to set the terms and conditions of staff to reflect the competitive market conditions. The JCPA recommended that the Auditor-General have freedom to set the terms and conditions of staff, with a proviso that the terms and conditions be consistent with industrial relations standards. The government rejected the recommendations. The staff will still be employed under the Public Service Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel that these bills are good. They will bring auditing and accountability into the 20th century. It will protect the public purse. However, I feel that, if these four areas in the bills had been addressed by the government, that protection would have been more adequately provided. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to open my comments on the Financial Management and Accountability Bill and cognate bills that we are debating this morning in a positive manner. It certainly has been an interesting exercise for me, as a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, to have had the opportunity to scrutinise government legislation on its way through the legislative process in this parliament between the first and second readings and to have been a party to report No. 331 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which made some 39-odd recommendations to the minister with regard to changes we sought to the three bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government maintains the chair of that committee and has a majority on that committee, but it has given members of the opposition on that committee the opportunity to scrutinise government legislation and to have a positive input into changes that we saw as being necessary in an attempt to improve the government's legislation. The government has opted to take up a number&mdash;probably 75 per cent&mdash;of the committee's recommendations, but four very important recommendations have been rejected by the government. I will concentrate my comments today on those recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee took evidence from a number of different authorities, including GBEs that fall under the FMA Bill and GBEs that fall under the CAC Bill. There were probably a couple of central elements that came through in the comments that were made. The government had embarked on this consultative process as far as the parliament was concerned. The parliament, through the Joint Committee on Public Accounts, had had ample opportunity to scrutinise the legislation that had been drafted by the Department of Finance and PM&amp;C, I think. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One critical comment made by a number of the GBEs was that there was not enough consultation on that side of the exercise. I do not know how effective the bills will be after enactment. We hope they will be very effective because the government in Australia today is going down this road of commercialisation and corporatisation of a lot of government activities. A lot of the directors of these authorities made the point that they would have appreciated a bit more consultation and a bit more input into the drafting of the bills. I do not know whether that comes from the fact that they also were a bit concerned that some clauses in the bills are going to move them more in line with commercial directors under the Corporations Law&mdash;which we all agree with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> When drafting a bill such as this, if you spend more time in the consultation period before implementation, there will be a far shorter dispute period after the event. I do not know what the outcome is going to be, but a number of GBEs and representatives commented to that effect. We received a lot of submissions and took a lot of evidence from different organisations that are going to be the subject of these bills when they are enacted. So in future, the government and the public servants in the departments might take that comment on board. It has been proven time and time again that, in a process of reform and change, if you spend more time on the consultative process before enactment, any disputation period after the event will be much shorter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will briefly formally outline what the bills are about. The Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1994&mdash;the FMA Bill&mdash;forms part of a package of three bills. The other bills in the package are the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill and the Auditor-General Bill. They all replace the Audit Act of 1901. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FMA Bill seeks to provide a regulatory framework for Commonwealth instrumentalities which financially are agents of the Commonwealth, that is, broadly speaking, those bodies which do not own their funds and operate squarely within the provisions of sections 81 and 83 of the constitution. Agencies covered by the FMA Bill include executive departments, parliamentary departments and many state authorities. The FMA Bill specifies the responsibilities and powers of the Minister for Finance, revises the Commonwealth's fund accounting structure, modernises the accounting system, prescribes rules for the control and management of public property, outlines the powers and responsibilities of chief executives of Commonwealth agencies, provides for the preparation of monthly statements of fund's transaction and the audit of financial statements by Commonwealth agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In April 1989, the parliamentary Joint Committee of Public Accounts presented its report No. 269, which we have already heard about this morning, called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Auditor-General: Ally of the people and parliament&mdash;reform of the Australian Audit Office</EMPHASIS>. That report recommended that the Audit Act be repealed and replaced with more modern and flexible financial management. This recommendation was accepted by the government in November 1989. Interestingly enough, although the government accepted report No. 269 from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, some elements of that report concerning the Auditor-General Act still have not been addressed. We will come to that a bit later on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FMA Bill was introduced on 29 June 1994 by the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) and referred, on his motion, to the JCPA for review, with an advisory report to be presented by 23 August&mdash;which, as we know, came later on. From that point on, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts has spent a great deal of time talking to the departmental officers that have been involved in the drafting of these bills, as well as to a lot of those Commonwealth authorities that are going to be affected by the bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill, otherwise known as the CAC Bill, is the second of the three bills that we are debating this morning. Broadly, the CAC Bill will provide a single set of core reporting and auditing requirements for directors of Commonwealth authorities and establish standards of conduct for executive officers. It is much the same as the FMA Bill, but it deals with organisations or government bodies that basically own their own money, and the Commonwealth is a shareholder in their activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the perspective of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the third bill, the Auditor-General Bill, is probably the most important of the three bills. The CAC Bill and the FMA Bill are going to give government business enterprises accounting responsibilities as if they were out there in the commercial world under the Corporations Law. That is fine; we agree with all those things. We were looking to get from the government a little bit more independence for the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General Bill establishes the Office of the Auditor-General for the Commonwealth of Australia and defines the terms and conditions for appointment to that office. The Auditor-General is appointed for a single maximum term of seven years; a government amendment is seeking to make that a minimum of five years and a maximum of seven years. I will shortly compare some of these more important aspects with what the JCPA recommended. Prior to advising the Governor-General on the appointment of a new Auditor-General, the responsible minister must consult with the Minister for Finance, a nominee of the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives, and the chairperson of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 4 of the bill deals with the main functions and powers of the Auditor-General. This part sets out in broad terms the mandate and reporting responsibilities of the Auditor-General to conduct financial statement and performance audits of Commonwealth agencies and companies. In addition to statutory audit reports of financial statements, other reports may contain specific information which the Auditor-General considers should be brought before the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Auditor-General is empowered to carry out financial audits of GBEs, the bill does not allow GBEs to be performance audited. The government argues that under its GBE reforms the bottom line is the important issue and GBEs will still be responsible to ministers. This ignores the fact that GBEs are still public entities and the Auditor-General is simply the mechanism by which parliament is kept informed of the operations of government bodies. The government is effectively arguing that GBEs should generally be exempt from parliamentary scrutiny of performance. This is not an acceptable position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The JCPA recommended that the relevant clauses should be amended to allow an audit committee of the JCPA, which we will discuss a bit later on, to request audits of GBEs. The Auditor-General also argued that the Auditor-General should be allowed to show proposed reports to anyone who was thought to have a special interest. The JCPA agreed and recommended an appropriate amendment, with disclosure of these reports prohibited. That is a very important element as a third stage of what we are trying to do here. In report No. 331, the JCPA states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Department of Finance explained:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has decided to exclude GBEs on the basis that under its GBE reforms the emphasis is on the bottom line.</PARA>
<PARA>That is all good and well. But the government will say to a GBE: `This year we want a seven per cent net return.' That is okay; that means that the GBE is given exact parameters to work to. That is where we have to end up. It does not matter if we can do it better; this is all we have to produce for the government. If we can do it better, if we can produce more efficiencies, we have a bit more fat to do this, that and the other thing. I do not believe that it provides enough scrutiny. However, the accounting bodies argue that while GBEs may be accountable to their minister under this proposal, they are not accountable to their shareholders&mdash;the public. In taking evidence and in debating these issues at all stages we talk about the shareholders being the Commonwealth. That is all good and well. That sounds like a single entity. But the shareholders are the people of Australia, the taxpayers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every single time I get on my feet in this parliament I point out to the government and to anybody who is listening that the shareholders are the people of Australia. The people who own the assets that the government is selling today are the taxpayers of Australia. It is not the executive, it is not the members on the government benches and it is not this parliament&mdash;it is the taxpayers of Australia. That is what is pointed out by the accounting bodies. They say they are not accountable to the shareholders&mdash;the public. Entities that use or manage public resources must be held accountable to the public. Unlike shareholders of a company in the private sector, the ultimate owners of a GBE, being the public, cannot withdraw their funds at any time. The only time they can withdraw their funds is if the government decides to sell the GBE, like it is trying to do with ANL and Australian Stevedores. The ultimate shareholders do not have the individual authority to do that so they cannot withdraw their funds at any time if dissatisfied with management's performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, an alternative mechanism to protect the public interest is required. One such mechanism is an audit by the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General, however, argues from another perspective, maintaining that parliament has a right to oversee the expenditure of all public money. Bearing in mind what I was saying about the public being the shareholders, 147 members in this place&mdash;not just the government, not just the executive, but all the members of the parliament&mdash;are the representatives of the public. So parliament has the right to know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go back to report 296, which nominated the Auditor-General as the ally of the parliament. So the Auditor-General is not important in the equation. The principle is parliament's right to know&mdash;not the Auditor-General's. The Auditor-General's office is merely a mechanism which works for parliament to expose facts that otherwise would not be exposed. Professor Finn of the ANU agreed that the GBE exception is a limitation on the powers of the Auditor-General and in substance is a limitation on the powers of the parliament. As a limitation on the powers of the parliament it is a limitation on the powers of the people of Australia. That must be highlighted to the government in rejecting that opportunity for the Auditor-General to participate in the process in that way as that very important link between the government, the executive, the GBEs and the parliament, which is ultimately representative of all the shareholders of these companies, who are the taxpayers right across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to go through some of the other recommendations that were rejected by the government and that came out of report 331. The first was recommendation 28, and was about the Auditor-General having the ability to negotiate the terms and conditions to employ his own staff. We have heard a lot from government members about giving the Auditor-General more independence. This is not giving him any independence. It is like Centenary House&mdash;he had no opportunity to negotiate what went on there. He is given a global budget but he is told by the Department of Finance, the Minister for Finance, where he is going to be accommodated and under what conditions he is going to be accommodated. It is the same story with the employment of staff. He does not have the opportunity to negotiate an enterprise agreement with his staff and establish conditions for his senior staff. Recommendation 37 by the JCPA was with regard to the Audit Committee of Parliament. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Public Accounts Committee Act 1951 should be amended by inclusion of a separate section empowering the Joint Committee of Public Accounts to perform the functions of the Audit Committee of Parliament. The amendments should:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) change the name of the Committee to Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) list the functions to be performed by the JCPA when convening as the Audit Committee of Parliament and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) confer the same powers and privileges to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts when carrying out its audit committee functions as when carrying out its traditional duties.</PARA>
<PARA>That recommendation has been rejected by the government as well. Recommendation 39 was a follow-on from that. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 5 of the Public Accounts Committee Act 1951 be amended to increase membership of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts to 16 members.</PARA>
<PARA>It is 15 under the current act. The recommendation goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act should state that the extra position is to be reserved for a parliamentarian nominated by any minority groups or independents in the parliament. If no such person exists, then the position should be filled according to the practice of the Parliament at that time for joint committees.</PARA>
<PARA>What has been proposed in the Auditor-General Bill by the government is that the Audit Committee be chaired by the Speaker of the House and it be made up in a different manner from that which we have proposed. The government, to its credit, referred these three bills to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts for its recommendations. This is the second report the JCPA has made with regard to changes that need to be made to how the Auditor-General operates and to how that Audit Committee should exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the second time the government has rejected the recommendations of the JCPA with regard to the independence of the Auditor-General. I know that government members probably do not like some of the work the Auditor-General does and some of the reports that he writes. But if all the 147 members of this House are serious as being representatives of the people of Australia, we need to have that watchdog there for the shareholders of all these companies that the Commonwealth owns but that are really owned by the taxpayers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So as we debate these bills today I urge the government, and particularly the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), to reconsider those four very important recommendations that the Joint Committee of Public Accounts made with regard to generating more independence, making government departments more accountable, making them be seen to be more accountable, and making the Auditor-General truly independent so he can do the job that he is empowered to do, or should be empowered to do, as the watchdog of government activities and government bodies on behalf of the shareholders of those government business enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shareholders of those government business enterprises are not the executive government; they are not the members sitting on the government benches; they are not all the members of this parliament. The shareholders are the taxpayers of Australia, who deserve to have their rights protected by the Auditor-General. I urge the government to reconsider those four very important recommendations that have come out of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts report 331. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The white paper on defence which is being presented in this chamber sets out a framework for developing Australian defence policy over the next decade, and for making force structure and capability decisions which will shape our Defence Force well into the next century. All Australian governments have a core responsibility to defend this country. Uniquely among the nations of the world, we have a continent of our own to protect. In defence terms, this gives us some real advantages, not least the moat around us. But it also imposes enormous responsibilities. The way we meet those responsibilities is in a very real sense a measure of our sense of our nationhood.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defending Australia is a substantial document, and I congratulate the minister and those officials and members of the Defence Force who were involved in its preparation. It is a document for this time&mdash;a time of rapid change in the region and the world; a  period of less obvious threat than the Cold War years, but of less certainty as well. The white paper reflects that underlying strategic uncertainty. The rapid growth in the Asia-Pacific region and the changes in regional relationships confront Australia with both opportunities and challenges in its defence planning. For example, the very fluidity of the post Cold War world gives us an opportunity for the first time to build up organisations like APEC and the ASEAN Regional Forum. But that same fluidity makes it even more important that we succeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper therefore reflects this government's strong determination to ensure that Australia maintains the most effective possible defence capability. Defending Australia sets out comprehensively how this will be done, and the details have been outlined in this House by my colleague the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Punch). The government will sustain defence spending at about two per cent of GDP, and for the first time ever we will institute a five-year defence budget commitment from 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the core of Australian defence policy is self-reliance, by which we mean the capability to defend ourselves against any credible attack on Australia without relying on the combat forces of other countries. The white paper's defence equipment decisions are all directed towards strengthening that self-reliant capability. Those decisions include the purchase of airborne early warning and control aircraft, the replacement of the Macchi lead-in fighters, new transport aircraft, helicopters for the Anzac frigates, minehunters and improved command, control, communications and intelligence networks. We will also review the need for additional Collins class submarines in the context of our first five-year defence budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just over a year ago I attended the launch of the first of the Collins class submarines in Adelaide, and earlier this year I saw the launch of the first Anzac frigate. Both programs are clear evidence of how Australian design, technology, construction techniques and work force skills can excel against the best in the world. Collins is the most advanced conventionally powered submarine in the world&mdash;a clear demonstration of this country's ability to produce world class technology at competitive prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that, by building up our national shipbuilding base through projects like these, and the coastal minehunters, we are also building up a capability that can be a real resource for cooperative programs with our neighbours. And the capabilities of Australian industry are not limited to large-scale construction programs. We are also developing state-of-the-art skills in high technology areas such as weapons and sensors. The Jindalee over the horizon radar system and the NULKA active expendable decoy are both examples of the innovation and ingenuity of Australian defence science. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper is about more than enhancing our defence self-reliance. Our security also depends on the extent to which we can improve our strategic environment, both by building bilateral regional defence relationships and working multilaterally to enhance regional and global security. The white paper outlines how the government is doing these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Multilaterally, we continue to support the United Nations, both its preventative diplomacy and its peacekeeping operations. We do not structure the Australian Defence Force for such operations, but the ADF has shown that its force structure and readiness levels are sufficient to undertake United Nations' tasks. Men and women from the ADF, as well as from the Australian Federal Police, have already served with distinction and effectiveness in many peacekeeping operations around the globe, and continue to do so today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regionally, we have been working to build institutions which will provide a framework for cooperation in the very different environment we now face. APEC is one important development. Although it does not itself have a political or security role, and Australia is not seeking this, APEC certainly has strategic benefits. By bringing both sides of the Asia-Pacific into a broad economic partnership it makes less likely the attenuation of security ties between the United States and its Asian allies as a result of trade frictions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has also been a very active proponent and supporter of the ASEAN Regional Forum. When this group met for the first time in Bangkok in July this year, it was the first time the countries of the region had sat down at the same table to discuss security issues. The forum is still at a very early stage of its development, but we think it has the potential to help us deal more effectively with future problems or tensions in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strength and durability of our bilateral defence relationships with our neighbours has been critical in underpinning the growing regional consensus on security issues which in turn made the ASEAN Regional Forum possible. One of the key elements in the white paper is the government's commitment to strengthening defence links with the countries of the region&mdash;to strategic partnership. The general approach outlined in the white paper has been welcomed by our neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A senior adviser to the Indonesian defence minister recently described Defending Australia as a `watershed in the strategic outlook of Australia', paving the way for a strategic partnership with Indonesia. I agree. I also agree with the Indonesian defence minister, General Edi Sudradjat, who said, `a good relationship between Indonesia and Australia is not a matter of choice. It is a must.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, that is true across the board, not just in the defence area. Earlier this year the Indonesian and Australian defence ministers agreed to hold annual meetings, and the potential exists to expand areas of practical cooperation between our military forces. We are also building our defence relationship with other neighbours in the Asia-Pacific. Singapore is already conducting air force and army training in Australia, and Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and I have talked about other areas of defence cooperation. With Malaysia, too, we have a long and mutually rewarding defence relationship, both through the Five Power Defence Arrangements and bilaterally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1995, for the first time, regional countries will participate in our major military exercise, Kangaroo. And the white paper underlines the continuing importance of our defence alliance with New Zealand, involving mutual commitment by each country to the security of the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some commentators have seen a tension in the two objectives of defence self-reliance and greater strategic engagement with the countries around us, but I believe no such tension exists. In defence policy no less than in other areas of Australia's engagement with Asia, our efforts to improve our own capacities as a nation and our ability to operate successfully in the region are two sides of the same coin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The security and stability of Asia will be increasingly determined by the policies and activities of countries in the region. But in the government's view, this cannot and will not be achieved without the continued and constructive engagement of the United States, which remains the world's largest economy, Asia's largest single trading partner, and the world's most capable military power. This government believes that continued engagement by the United States in the Asia-Pacific through its network of alliances around the western Pacific is important to regional stability and regional security. As I said earlier, our concern about the consequences for strategic links across the Pacific of any increase in trade and economic friction is one of the reasons we think APEC is such a good economic model for the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the United States alliance is important for reasons much more particular to Australia. Although we do not rely on the United States for the defence of Australia, the deterrent effect of the alliance to any possible enemy makes a central contribution to our national security. It also provides Australia with very important access to intelligence and technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper underlines the importance not just of equipment and the strategic environment, but of our people. That is exactly as it should be, because the highly trained and highly motivated men and women of our Defence Force are the key to the ADF's capabilities. In the new environment our capabilities will depend more and more on the human factor&mdash;better commanders, higher levels of skill, more individual initiative and more effective teamwork. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very proud earlier in the year to be able to farewell in Townsville some of the Australian forces going off to Rwanda to serve with the United Nations mission there. The men and women at the airport were on their way to conditions which very few Australians have experienced, and many would find difficult to imagine. But the enthusiasm and morale of the troops, as well as their obvious high level of competence, were very evident. It reflected very well on them and on those who recruited and trained them. It has been reflected, too, in their performance since they arrived in Rwanda, as their colleagues have shown earlier in Somalia and Cambodia and elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government understands that military life continues to place particular and difficult demands on those who serve in the ADF and on their families. So the government will provide Australian Defence Force personnel with a package of pay, conditions of service and other benefits, including housing, designed specifically to address the special features of military service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defending Australia also includes the most comprehensive and significant statement on reserves ever made by an Australian government. The reserves are important. Indeed, they are an integral and essential part of the force structure, comprising more than one-third of the uniformed strength of the ADF. As the white paper makes clear, the reserves are no longer just a backup to the regular forces or an expansion base but, with the regular forces, form a total force in which all elements work together in a coordinated and complementary effort. This is an important change in the structure of the ADF.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">National security depends on more than the capacity of our Defence Force. It depends on the strength of our economy, the cohesiveness of our society, the effectiveness of our national institutions and the unity, sense of purpose and confidence of our people. Defending Australia is, therefore, closely related to other government policies. The white paper on employment and training, Working Nation, which is about that very thing&mdash;that is, cohesion and inclusion&mdash;and, no less, the development of APEC, have the same overall purpose of this defence white paper, to strengthen the fabric and resolve of Australia, to enlarge our capacities and to create a more prosperous and secure future for our children. I commend the white paper and its contents to the parliament and to the country. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not have thought many of you would know much about the issue, not least the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). It is the first time I have ever heard him struggle to make any remarks about defence at all. Even then, he did not make any remarks of any substance. The fact is that it is something that strategic, scientific and regional developments demanded a long time ago and it is something that we on this side of the House have been urging the government to do for over three years but the government has continually insisted it was entirely unnecessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has recognised, as I say, far too late, how outdated and superseded its 1987 defence white paper has become. The sad thing is that I do not think this particular white paper has been worth the wait. Like all Labor policy documents, the most striking thing about this white paper is the gap between the rhetoric and the record, between what Labor has done in the past and what it says it will do in the future. I do not wish to imply that the exercise as a whole has been wasted. But I do believe it was an opportunity for innovative thinking and relevant planning that has been lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to imply that there has been a fundamental erosion of the important common ground which the major political parties have traditionally shared on national defence policy. But I do want to emphasise that this white paper highlights the very significant differences on specific issues of defence policy that exist between the government and the opposition. The 1987 white paper was always an uneasy compromise between competing strategic and financial views. That fact in the end discredited it. This 1994 white paper suffers from the same failing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons for producing this white paper was that fundamental changes in Australia's strategic environment have flowed from the end of the Cold War, from the pace of economic dynamism in the Asia-Pacific region and from the developing sense of regional economic community. But where does this starting point lead the white paper? Where are the policy responses appropriate to these fundamentally changed and changing circumstances? Such responses are nowhere to be found in this white paper. All we get is a regurgitation of the philosophy that has underpinned defence policy for many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A good deal of the philosophy, including modernisation of our defence equipment and appreciating the centrality of the American alliance, continues to be a pillar of our defence policy but much has changed as well. This is not reflected in the policy recommendations of the white paper. The structure of this paper is similar to that of its 1987 predecessor and so is much of its thinking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course there are some things in this white paper which we fully agree with. The global and regional strategic assessment is sensible and realistic in the main. There is a good deal in what is said about Australia's defence posture, force development objectives and concerns of defence personnel and Australia's defence industry that we would endorse. We welcome the commitment to produce much needed defence assets, such as an airborne early warning and control capability, which we have been calling for for a very long period of time, including throughout the year I was the shadow minister for defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, this white paper is a deeply disappointing, timid and flawed document that is unworthy of the vital issues it addresses. It does nothing to address our longstanding concerns about the way capabilities, operational readiness and personnel levels have been eroded. Today I want to highlight the main reasons why the coalition parties have come to that conclusion. First, the white paper claims to be much more than it really is. Many of its so-called announcements on force structure and equipment acquisitions are not new. Very little of its analytical thinking is new or incisive. It simply recycles the 1991 force structure review and the 1993 strategic review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the extent that the white paper announces anything genuinely new, it foreshadows further reviews, rather than stating policy decisions: military satellites, to be examined; unmanned aerial vehicles, to be examined; fixed seabed acoustic arrays, to be examined; airborne early warning aircraft, closer to decision but to be examined; the force structure of the land force, to be examined; the ready reserves, to be examined; the call-out protection for reserves, to be examined; and the two extra Collins class submarines, while currently off the agenda, to be examined in 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you examined all those things and came to the conclusion that they should all go ahead, where is the money coming from? There is absolutely no indication at all that, even if the government, having fulfilled this raft of examinations, were to come to some positive conclusion, any of it could be funded. I say very deliberately that most of the worthwhile initiatives that this white paper does announce have been pinched directly from the coalition's 1992 defence policy, A Strong Australia, and I will return to that a little later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the inadequacy of this white paper should come as no surprise as it does nothing to turn around Labor's failed record on defence policy. Over the past decade, Labor's policies have cut Australia's defence capability. We have lost two of our six infantry battalions; our fighter force has been reduced from four to three squadrons; we have fewer surface combatants and fewer submarines available for operational service; personnel numbers have dropped by 20 per cent, including in the ranks of our combat units; sustainability levels have been seriously eroded as the government has traded off stockholding to meet underfunded recurrent expenditure; conditions of service of defence personnel have been eroded; and the force structure review initiatives, such as the ready reserve scheme and the commercial support program, to some extent have failed to deliver the efficiencies and savings expected of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1987 defence white paper was built on rubbery spending projections and delivered an unbalanced defence force. It also foreshadowed defence expenditure of between 2.6 and three per cent, and that was never achieved. The facts are that the 1994-95 budget allocations on defence will drop to the lowest level as a percentage of government outlays since the last years of the totally discredited Whitlam government. By the end of the current Labor term, it will fall to the lowest percentage of GDP since the end of the Second World War. The new white paper does far too little to redress the failures of defence policy and planning over the last decade. Too much of this paper is devoted to justifying existing structure and capabilities or papering over the cracks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Third, much of the white paper talks about the goal of defence self-reliance. But the document fails entirely to explain how this objective will be funded&mdash;and I have referred already to the issue of funding. In 1987 the government, as I have said, was projecting 2.6 to three per cent of GDP for the defence budget&mdash;a target it did not even get near. In 1994-95 the defence budget will be a full $2.5 billion lower than if spending had fulfilled the 1987 white paper's projections. The Defence Force has been denied about $11 billion that it could have expected since 1987 had spending matched 2.6 per cent of GDP, the minimum foreshadowed in the 1987 white paper. This time around the government is promising to do more than it did in 1987, but it is proposing to do so with a declining proportion of GDP. This is just another Labor magic pudding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper commits the government to defence expenditure of approximately two per cent of GDP over the next few years&mdash;which is Labor's way of saying, `Get ready for 1.8 or 1.7 per cent.' The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) smiles&mdash;but, you see, we have seen it all before. We have seen it so often before. You promise so much and you deliver so little. If you had not promised so much in the 1987 defence white paper and, therefore, had not breached your commitment to the defence establishment and those interested in these issues, then this might all be a bit more believable. But the fact is you said one thing in 1987 and you did another thing, and there is every reason to believe, particularly with the present Prime Minister, that when you say one thing you almost certainly mean another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the white paper reflects a significant element of uncertainty and indecisiveness about a strategic document. The 1987 white paper outlined a policy of defence in depth, which aimed to deny an enemy access to the air and sea gap to Australia's north. By the time of the 1993 strategic review, the policy of denial in the air-sea gap had been upgraded to control, thus demanding significantly upgraded defence capabilities. But this white paper makes no mention of the aim to control the air-sea gap, returning to the policy of denial. Of course, there was no clarification of this point in the Prime Minister's speech&mdash;not surprisingly, because I do not think he really is, in the slightest, interested in defence issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifth, the coalition parties, let me say in a positive sense, do welcome the white paper's commitment to strategic engagement with regional countries. The only pity is that the government is years too late with this initiative. We set out the policy agenda in this area, and the government has finally decided that this particular strategic priority is worth pinching and trying to claim as its own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">May I refer the government to pages 25 to 49 of the coalition's 1992 defence policy, A Strong Australia. Those opposite will find there a rational and detailed blueprint for what we called then `a policy of cooperative regional defence'. No doubt those who wrote the white paper are well acquainted with those pages, because the ideas in them have been extensively adopted. But what the white paper fails to emphasise adequately in this regard is that regional cooperation goes beyond a series of upgraded bilateral defence links. It entails building on the sense of strategic community, to the extent that it exists in the region, and promoting regional defence ties in a broad sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sixth point I would make is in relation to defence personnel. As usual, they are the big losers, and they have been, of course, since the 1987 white paper. Nothing has changed in this white paper. The government claims that it is redressing the Defence Force's low level of preparedness by raising a 5th Battalion over a period of three or four years, as resources become available&mdash;which probably means it will never happen. But let us see through this for the sham that it is. The 1st Battalion currently has a nominal strength of 703 and an actual strength of 675; the 2nd/4th Battalion has a nominal strength of 689 and an actual strength of 526; the 3rd Battalion has a nominal strength of 623 but is down to 557; and the 5th/7th Battalion has a nominal operating strength of 740 but is actually 480. Meanwhile, the 14 reserve infantry battalions are all inadequately manned, trained and equipped. Of course, this white paper does absolutely nothing about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very briefly, a final point I want to make relates to defence exports. The government's 1986 Cooksey report estimated that Australia could have defence exports of $500 million by the early 1990s. Judged against that objective, the government's policy has been a failure, and this white paper does not fix it up. Defence exports are currently worth $17 million per year; our total annual exports of controlled defence products are around $90 million a year. That is a far cry from the idea of Australia being a defence industry support base for South-East Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, this white paper fails in its stated purpose. It was an opportunity to genuinely modernise defence thinking and to reinvigorate defence structures. It has failed on both counts. It is an opportunity missed rather than an opportunity seized. It continues Labor's record in defence of promising far more than it can or it will ever deliver. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Regrettably, the 15 minutes available to me today does not allow me to digress from the important comments I wish to make in reply to some of those statements that have just been made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer). I would be delighted if the opposition wanted to extend to me the courtesy of extending my time today or, indeed, allowing me to speak when the debate resumes, because I would welcome the opportunity to put to rest the misleading statements that have just been put to the House by the Leader of the Opposition. It might in short, though, demonstrate the point to recall that, as a former shadow spokesperson for defence, the Leader of the Opposition took to the people of Australia an opposition policy which promised reductions in defence outlays of substantial amounts, indeed, far greater than the reductions that have been implemented by this government in the last budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn to the substance of the important questions before the House in this white paper. Since the last white paper was released in 1987, we have seen an end to the Cold War, the growth of economies in Asia and the Pacific, and the increased modernisation of the military forces of countries throughout our region. The 1994 white paper, Defending Australia, describes how our defence policy will adjust to this new, much more complex and demanding strategic environment. Our defence policy recognises that, in future, the relative strength and quality of our forces will depend increasingly on the quality of our people&mdash;the military, civilians and contractors who together form the Australian defence organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence, with specific responsibilities for our reserves, I will focus my contribution today on aspects relating to the reserve forces. Defending Australia, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has pointed out, includes the most comprehensive and significant statements on reserves ever made by an Australian government. For the past 150 years, the defence of Australia has relied on some form of citizen based military component. For all of this period, these citizen soldiers, sailors and aircrew have served the community in peace and war with great courage and distinction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The period following World War II saw a move away from citizen based defence towards more regular forces. Reserve units were, in the main, held as an expansion base for the development of a larger force, without meaningful roles in lesser contingencies. This is no longer so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with trends around the globe, today's reserves are no longer simply a backup to the regular forces or an expansion base; they are an integral and essential part of the force structure, comprising nearly 40 per cent of the uniformed strength of the Australian Defence Force. As a result, reserves are now allocated specific and important roles in the defence of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To achieve a truly integrated total force, though, all elements need to have a similar standard of individual training. The distinction between regulars and reserves will then only be one of relative difference in military experience and availability. The government is committed to individual training for regular and reserve members being conducted to a common core and to the same standard. In the same way, there is a need to increase the experience levels of reserve officers and senior non-commissioned officers. The government will provide the opportunity for selected individuals to develop more experience through extended part-time service or by serving for periods on a full-time basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Army reserve training will be targeted for special attention&mdash;both individual and collective training will  change. Many of the responsibilities of reserve training groups will be transferred to centralised training establishments. The standard of reserve basic officer training will be increased and will be conducted under the control of the Royal Military College, Duntroon. Recruit training will increase and will be the responsibility of the recruit training battalion. Initial employment training will be in line with regular training courses at a level consistent with likely operational tasks. Responsibility for the initial employment training of reserves will rest with the relevant corps. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures will see a change in the method of delivery of training for reserves. Whilst training groups will be maintained to assist in the delivery of these programs, responsibility for the programs will rest with the central training establishment. Following these changes, training groups will not be responsible for the structure or standard of training programs. Indeed, it is likely that an increased number of these programs will be conducted centrally although there is clearly an important need for regional training to continue to be available, facilitated through training groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of these and other changes announced in the white paper are designed to further develop reserve capability. This will ensure reserve units are capable of undertaking the roles and tasks assigned to them as part of the total force within the required readiness periods. I expect the implementation of this goal will also require an enhancement in availability and type of equipment for reserves. The implementation of these new measures for training and equipment will continue to receive my close attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although not subject to call-out for United Nations peacekeeping or humanitarian relief forces, reserves with the necessary skills and military training have made, and will continue to make, a valuable contribution to such operations. As reserve training, skill level and capabilities improve I would anticipate that the opportunity for reserves to contribute to such deployments will increase. In meeting these new challenges, greater flexibility will be sought in lateral recruitment particularly from ex-regulars. The government will examine whether further incentives or some form of obligation might positively assist in the transfer of regulars to the reserves. Transfer between full-time and part-time components will be made easier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of these enhanced roles for reserves, and the review of army structure to be undertaken next year, consideration will also be given to the appropriate availability of reserve depots. The location of some reserve depots reflects demographic characteristics which existed during and after the Second World War and they need to be consolidated to meet the current demands of collective training. Those no longer required will be assessed for suitability for use by local community groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employment of reserves varies between the three services. Whereas reserves in army are mostly members of formed units, navy and air force reserves are integrated as individuals, or in small numbers, into full-time operational and support units. Navy and air force maintain relatively small numbers of active reserves. When combined with inactive members, who bring skills from previous regular service, they enable the rapid increase in rates of effort required for operational deployment and also for the expansion of intelligence, communications and headquarters staff functions for round-the-clock operations. Navy reserves contribute to overall naval capability by providing trained personnel to serve on a part-time basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reserves manage naval control of shipping and contribute significantly to the intelligence, mine sweeping and diving capabilities. Some areas, such as submarines and surface combatants where high readiness or high rates of peacetime activity are required, are not suited to a high level of reserve participation. Nevertheless, individual naval reserves provide additional capacity to regular crews. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Air force active reserves provide capability enhancement in the critical functions of air traffic control, intelligence, technical support for aircraft operations and ground support for forward base operations. I will be pursuing with the services the wider use of reserves both as individuals and as formed groups in the navy and the air force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ready reserve is a relatively new scheme, having been introduced in 1991. The ready reserve is an innovative approach to meeting the nation's defence needs on a cost-effective basis. It has generated a good deal of interest in the Australian defence community and, more broadly, in the Australian community. It has also been the subject of interest from the defence community abroad. The ready reserve will reach full maturity in December 1996. In accordance with the arrangements announced at the introduction of the scheme I will shortly be announcing a progress review of the ready reserve scheme, which I anticipate will be completed by mid-1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As members of both the community at large and the Australian Defence Force, reserves provide an important link between the ADF and the community. The government recognises the competing interest that reservists have in balancing their work, personal and defence obligations. Research into employer attitudes to reserve service will be undertaken to determine the most cost-effective means of providing incentives or forms of recognition of the contribution employers of reserves make to defence. Further, an investigation of options to improve the availability of reserves for training will be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Support from employers for reserve personnel is a major element in their ability to serve. In turn, employers and the community benefit from an effective Defence Force, especially from the training its members receive. Reserve personnel themselves also, of course, gain considerable benefit from this training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Defence Reserves Support Committee, which has more than 150 voluntary members throughout Australia, plays a very important role in the relationship between the reserves and their employers. It will continue to receive the government's full support. The government recognises that if reservists are required to defend our country, it has an obligation to ensure that their families are cared for, their civilian employment is secure and their other civilian interests are protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The following specific measures to protect reserves' interests on call-out are currently under consideration by the government. They include: guaranteeing a return to their place of employment, offering financial compensation to employers, deferring tertiary studies and other employment related training or education, reinstating employment related licences, assisting with the member's family home mortgage, providing assistance with the welfare of reserve families and offering a call-out disruption payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In forging closer links between the reserve personnel and communities in which they live, the government recognises the assistance that reserves can provide in time of local emergency. Reserve facilities, equipment and skills have the potential to provide valuable emergency relief assistance to the community in times of fire, flood or other such disaster. Current arrangements for requesting Defence Force assistance allow reserves to volunteer their services, but their immediate availability and the diversion of resources away from military training activities are currently seen as impediments to using them. To increase their availability in emergency circumstances, voluntary reserve participation and funding for such activities will be separated from normal allocations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, the white paper recognises the contribution which Australian industry capability plays in the defence of Australia. The government recognises that industry's contribution to our defence effort will become more important as our strategic environment becomes more demanding. The white paper builds on the government's May industry statement and the parliament's industry committee's report on government purchasing, which I tabled in March this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper recognises the opportunities for Australian industry to supply major items and equipment for defence where it offers value for money but, importantly, taking into account factors including the ability to meet needs arising from our geographic and strategic environment, the development of a capacity for through-life support and assurance of uninterrupted supply. I believe the white paper reinforces the future opportunities for domestic industries to continue to be important suppliers to our nation's Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I wish to make a few comments concerning the question of resources. The white paper establishes for the first time the government's commitment to the long-term planning of defence budgets with the announcement of a five-year budget commencing in 1996-97. This new arrangement will provide Defence with a much needed long-term consistency and certainty in both capital programs and personnel planning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The programs outlined in the white paper will require a modest real growth in defence spending. However, on current economic and strategic forecasts, the defence budget will not need to grow faster than the economy as a whole but will need to maintain an allocation representing approximately two per cent of GDP. Certainly, recent growth in the Australian economy would provide adequate additional funds to meet the real growth requirements set out in the white paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1994 defence white paper accurately and clearly sets out Australia's strategic position in our region and in the world. It includes important new initiatives in relation to both personnel and equipment. It places significant and appropriate importance on the links between Australian industry and our defence capability. It identifies our important alliances and their future development and it realistically sets out the resource requirements required to meet our defence needs as identified in the white paper. I commend the paper to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the defence white paper. In opening my contribution, I make the point that Australia is at a crossroads in its geopolitical, economic, cultural and historic interests. As traditional links with Europe and the UK slip into the past and while the defence relationship with the USA remains firm, Australia is seeking to involve itself more heavily with South-East Asia, economically and militarily.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two long-term trends have prompted this realignment. The first is the end of the superpower confrontation as a result of the end of the Cold War. The decline of Soviet influence in the Pacific has already brought changes in how the USA projects its influence in the region. As this happens and as the USA-Japan relationship evolves, Japan and China are expected to expand their influence and security role in the area. ASEAN is responding to this by taking on a larger role in security affairs. In this context, Australia is also evolving its security interests to participate in the security affairs of and in Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second long-term trend is economic growth in the Asia-Pacific. As this accelerates, the strategic potential of the countries in the area will increase. The combination of population growth and expansion of technological and industrial capabilities will change dramatically the nature of the region's strategic environment. By the 21st century, these trends will have persisted and produced an environment significantly different from today's. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the House, subject to the strong reservations of both the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) yesterday and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) this morning, welcome the white paper in general terms as far as it goes. Why do we say that? It is worth recording in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> once again some of the points made by the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Punch) when presenting the statement in this place yesterday and with which no reasonable person should disagree.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also strongly committed to transparency in defence planning in order to build trust and reduce suspicion, especially within our own region.</PARA>
<PARA>In my view, the most important comment in the ministerial statement is:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, disputes can arise and intentions can change relatively quickly. Because military capabilities take many years to develop, it follows that we plan on the basis of capabilities and not threats.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a major departure from anything that this government has ever conceded before. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the capabilities available to mount lesser levels of attack on Australia will grow over the next 15 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . high priority will be given to the skilled people we need in the ADF. The Australian Defence Force's tradition of excellence is based on the professionalism of its people.</PARA>
<PARA>On that point I would like to pay tribute to all people in the Australian Defence Force who, over the last year, have made a significant contribution right around the globe in the interests of Australia and the world. The ministerial statement goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the government will emphasise investment in high-technology capabilities which increase our security.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the government will continue to pursue a more effective partnership between Defence and Australian industry. This is essential to strengthen defence self-reliance over the long term.</PARA>
<PARA>No reasonable person would disagree with that. However, it continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the next few years defence expenditure at current programmed levels will enable the plans and projects outlined in Defending Australia to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA>It also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . from 1996-97, it will provide defence with a five-year budget commitment.</PARA>
<PARA>I simply ask the House: a five-year budget of what? That is the big question mark, and both the honourable member for Flinders and the Leader of the Opposition had something to say about it in this place earlier. The bottom line is that there is a lot of common ground in this defence white paper, but there is no guarantee of total bipartisanship. That point is worth emphasising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few basic questions need to be asked. Has it been worth the wait? Is it more appropriately a green paper? Senator Newman made that point in the debate in the other place last week. By that I mean that the white paper seems to lack unequivocal commitments, a point that the Leader of the Opposition made forcefully in this place a little earlier. Have we heard it all before, albeit in different presentational terms? The sum total is that we remain disappointed with its substance; we remain disappointed with the bureaucratic and political rhetoric; we remain disappointed, despite what the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) has said, with the lack of budgetary commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know those opposite do not like to hear about history; nevertheless, I am going to remind them of a bit of history in the defence context. I go back to the May 1991 force structure review when the Executive Director of the Australian Defence Association, Michael O'Connor, hit the nail on the head, in my view, in his description of that review, which he saw as a mixture of ordinary housekeeping, a shopping list based on nothing more than good intentions and a manpower restructuring based on vague hope. In the debate on the force structure review of 1991 in this place, I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the strategy that underpins the 1987 Defence White Paper and its defence policy is questionable . . . Even in regional terms, our operational capacities . . . have serious limitations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has done nothing to redress these since other than to persist with the line that the White Paper&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the 1987 white paper&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">remains a valid cornerstone of its national security policy. In particular, our commitment to the Gulf war started to focus public attention on some of the real limitations of our defence capabilities. In some quarters&mdash;this is a view that I share&mdash;there has been a basic question mark as to whether the 1987 White Paper was written so that it meant all things to all people.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that the 1994 defence white paper smacks of the same attribute. I continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The result is an uneasy compromise between competing strategic and financial views. However, I would suggest that the White Paper&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the 1987 white paper&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">now poses bigger problems for this Government. Although the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) will not bring themselves to admit it, many of the underlying strategic assumptions have been overtaken. More significantly, it has locked the Government into a multi-billion dollar capital equipment purchasing program despite its failure to live up to the Budget allocations which the White Paper identified.</PARA>
<PARA>I continued:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequences are that other areas of defence spending, particularly manpower and operating costs, have to be squeezed to pay for the equip ment. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other words, the ADF has to continue to do more with less. Further, I said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Defence and the Minister for Foreign Affairs should accept that they need an early reassessment of national security strategy. Senator Ray's tablet of stone approach to the 1987 White Paper no longer holds water, as the increasing volatility of the international arena shows. The force structure review of 1991 is therefore poorly based and is a substantial figment of the Government's unfunded imagination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What the review lacks but requires for its own credibility is a number of things: it needs a clear assessment of the strategic realities facing Australia; it needs an analysis of the implications of these realities for Australia's national security situation; and, finally, it needs an outline of the restructuring of the Defence Force that flows from that changing strategic and security outlook.</PARA>
<PARA>All of that has now come home in the context of this 1994 defence white paper. Late last year, again in the context of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic review 1993</EMPHASIS>, Lieutenant General John Baker, the Vice Chief of the Defence Force, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our practice has been to undertake the strategic review every four years, but only write white paper where there is a fundamental redefinition of defence policy.</PARA>
<PARA>The big question is: has there been a redefinition of the defence policy? I suggest to members in the House that up to a point that is so, particularly now that the emphasis is on capabilities in the region rather than the threat in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Baker went on to outline the five key tenets of the strategic review in order of priority as follows: the defence of Australia; emphasis on collaboration with regional neighbours, a shift from a position of defence cooperation to a new position of strategic partnership with South-East Asia; continuing alliance relationship with the USA and New Zealand; continuing commitment to global security by contributing to the United Nations peacekeeping operations and participating in arms control and non-proliferation initiatives; and closer integration of defence and other national policies, notably foreign policy and defence industry policy. National resources such as local defence industry and military support services will be harnessed in the total defence effort. In early November last year, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1994 defence white paper will incorporate these and address their impact on Australia's force structure and the Department of Defence priorities. Significantly, this policy initially is being carried out in an environment in which there is no specific threat. We are now talking about security with the region, as distinct from a threat-based perception.</PARA>
<PARA>That has all come through in this white paper. But the big question mark is whether there is any substance to the written word. I will now refer to some of the points the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made earlier this morning and refer to some specific programs. The Collins class submarine project is a wonderful project. It is terrific for Australia in terms of where we are heading, but there are some big question marks over the interface between the weapons system and that boat, the transfer of technology and the future viability of the Australian Submarine Corporation. Whilst it is a great project, we should not lose sight of some of those questions which, I suspect, we will hear more about in the coming months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Anzac ship project is another good project. But I  suspect there are a few question marks over that across the Tasman, not the least of which is the result of some of the comments and some of the actions of the federal Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) in the last few weeks. In respect of the flea market approach to purchases, we have the additional purchase of an F111C and the purchase of two LSTs for the navy. Both are good buys but, as the honourable member for Flinders said yesterday, it is something that we should try to avoid. I am delighted to see once again that Jindalee and AWAC are mentioned in the white paper, but, as those opposite know, Jindalee will be absolutely toothless without those airborne warning and control aircraft. We continue to talk about it, but we do not do anything about it in financial terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have here today is nothing new. As the Leader of the Opposition said, it recycles a lot of what we have heard before. It foreshadows a number of reviews without coming up with anything of substance. To put it in the Leader of the Opposition's words, it is simply another magic pudding. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can assure the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) that there is a deep and serious interest in history on this side of the House and I will provide some. The history of Australia's foreign and defence policies has reflected our nation's struggle for independence and self-reliance. At the time of Federation, Australia's defence relied on the reputation and power of the Royal Navy&mdash;Britain's navy, not ours. Our foreign policy was conducted by the British Foreign Office which used the Office of the Governor-General as a postbox for its decisions. During and after World War II Australia replaced its dependency on the United Kingdom with yet another dependency relationship, this time with the United States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ANZUS was signed off by the Menzies government in 1951. It had two purposes: first, to reassure Australia and New Zealand that they could rely on the protection of the United States against any resurgence in Japanese aggression; second&mdash;and the significance of this grew through the 1950s and 1960s&mdash;to protect Australia during the Cold War tension between the US and the Soviet Union. These dependency relationships suited the politics and national outlook of the era. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For much of this century Australia feared its place in the world and this fear of isolation and distance was reflected in all aspects of national policy&mdash;tariff protection all-round, the White Australia policy, respect for Britain and the monarchy and dependency relationships in foreign policy and defence. Since the 1970s these icons of Australian nationhood have been transformed. Australia no longer sees its proximity to Asia as a liability but as a strategic asset. We no longer see Asian nations as a threat but as an outstanding opportunity to secure Australia's trading future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">White Australia has been replaced by the success and tolerance of Australian multiculturalism. Tariff walls have been replaced by this government's internationalisation of the Australian economy, consummated last month by APEC and the historic Bogor free trade declaration. Australians no longer see themselves as British, and the monarchy, broken and disgraced by the current generation of royals, is on the way out not just here but, I understand, in nations as diverse as Tuvalu and perhaps even in Britain itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This defence white paper is all about modernising Australia's security outlook, downscaling the significance of ANZUS and confirming, as it should, the end of Australia's association with relationships of dependency in defence. Its central theme&mdash;overriding, irresistible, sensible and pragmatic&mdash;is one of Australian self-reliance, not dependency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will outline the key principles which flow logically from this theme of defence self-reliance. First, our starting point is that Australia must maintain its capability to defend itself against armed attack: that is, Australia will provide its defence and security without relying on the combat forces of other countries. Second, Australia welcomes the challenge posed by its active participation in the dynamic Asia-Pacific region, not just through free trade and economic prosperity but by strengthening its bilateral defence relationships and pursuing multilateral approaches to regional security. Third, our planning focuses on capabilities rather than threats. I refer to the comments of the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) on the white paper:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No country has the capability to seize and hold major territory on our continent. Significantly, we believe that no country plans to develop such forces. To do so would require a very large effort, and we would expect to have substantial warning of any such development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key challenge for defence capability planning will be to adapt to the greater demands posed by increasing military capabilities in such short-warning conflict. We will continue to use the most cost-effective means to ensure our security. Our planning will exploit Australia's geographic advantages, technological capabilities, and our wider national resources to ensure we can defend this country. This means giving clear priority to the naval and air capabilities needed to deny our approaches to any adversary.</PARA>
<PARA>I endorse that approach set out by the Minister for Defence. Fourth, as set out in the white paper, we should maintain an alliance with the United States but not to the extent that we expect it to provide for Australia's defence. The white paper sets out the basis of our relationship with the United States in the 1990s as: relying on the nuclear capability of the United States to deter any nuclear threat or attack on Australia; cooperative intelligence arrangements; and scientific, technological and logistical cooperation. It is worth repeating that, under this government and this white paper, Australia does not rely on the United States for its defence. The security blanket and dependency relationship entrenched by successive coalition governments has been replaced by the philosophy and approach of self-reliance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifth, we should continue to support the United Nations and other multinational endeavours which promote global security. The white paper confirms this government's embrace of internationalism by supporting the outstanding work of the United Nations humanitarian and peacekeeping missions and the immense benefits of international treaty-making and cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key to this white paper is its commitment to regional security. It outlines how, as with trade and economic exchanges in the Asia-Pacific, a sense of community is emerging around shared strategic and security interests. The challenge now for Australia's foreign and defence policies is to foster and formalise this sense of community. In this regard I believe the white paper does not go far enough, forecasting, as it does at page 13, that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regional co-operation will be important in promoting a more secure environment, but it will not evolve into a collective defence arrangement which could subsume the defence of Australia into a wider regional defence organisation.</PARA>
<PARA>The white paper does not, however, flesh out the opportunities and benefits of collective defence arrangements at a lower level of commitment by the nations of the Asia-Pacific. It does not develop or embellish the sort of new regional architecture being explored by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans). It does not set an agenda for the emerging role of the 18-member ASEAN Regional Forum&mdash;this new and exciting process of dialogue and cooperation embracing each of the region's major security players. It does not promote the virtues of the forum taking a role in the development of agreed regional arrangements for maritime surveillance, nor does it flesh out the advantages to Australia of the forum developing the security foundations of a non-aggression pact across the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many ways, the white paper reflects an evolving security framework; that is, it is not willing to explicitly declare the foundations and initial purpose of ANZUS as moribund, and it is not yet willing to expand and specifically develop the concept of collective regional security. Our defence and foreign policy goals in the Asia-Pacific have baulked at the full-scale embrace of regionalism and cooperation so clearly apparent in the APEC free trade agreement. This has produced a dislocation between the military and economic components of Australia's national strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This view was well put by no less a figure than Malcolm Fraser, who yesterday wrote in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. The views of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer), who spoke earlier, were critical of the government's policy, abandoning any bipartisan approach to this defence white paper. If the Leader of the Opposition had read this article by his mentor Mr Fraser, I am sure he would have revised those views. Mr Fraser is not only suggesting that the government is moving in the right direction, but he is also critical of the Liberal Party's failure to embrace the opportunities posed by regional defence cooperation in the Asia-Pacific. He writes as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANZUS Treaty was primarily a defence against communist aggression. I could not conceive of a threat to Australia's future today that would be of much interest to the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has not yet understood the new freedom, the new independence we possess as a result of the end of the Cold War.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before that time, the strategic relationship with the US was given priority. This meant successive Australian governments argued less vehemently with the US on economic and trade matters than they otherwise should have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time we had one relationship with the US. In strategic terms we are a close and hopefully valued friend, but in economic and trade matters we are treated as hostile.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should be telling the US that they will have to make up their minds which relationship they wish to prevail&mdash;that we can no longer divorce trade and economic matters from the strategic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite deep and strengthened relationships with Japan, East Asia, and South-East Asia, the end of the Cold War suggests the need for a further reassessment of those relationships and where they may lead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also requires a reassessment of our relationships, especially with the US.</PARA>
<PARA>That Malcolm Fraser makes those remarks shows that the world has changed, and I endorse those remarks. I could not have put it any better. It is a very important lesson in the evolution of Australia's defence and foreign policies&mdash;not just a lesson to this side of the House but, more importantly, given Mr Fraser's political background, to the Liberal and National parties. He recognises the fact that trade and economic policies cannot be divorced from issues of strategy and security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may well be that our historic links with the United States emerge not as an asset but as a liability when trading in Asia. It is well understood by international economists that the United States, as an economic power, is facing issues of structural decline leading to trade deficits in Asia, particularly with Japan. Out of those trade deficits, there has been a whole series of tensions with Japan which have unsettled the Asia-Pacific region. It may well be that our historic links with the United States are as great a barrier to our trading success in Asia as are our archaic links with the United Kingdom and its monarchy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence policy is an important part of our modernisation as a nation and our links with Asia. I endorse totally the concept of not divorcing trade and economic matters from our defence policy. Mr Fraser has shown the important issues that have been taking place. The parliament should be aware of the trade tension between the United States and Japan. As economic development takes hold in the Asia-Pacific, it may well spread to other nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased to learn that, on this issue of independence from the United States, Australia at Bogor was willing to stick with Indonesia and its communique regardless of any objections from the United States. For our trade independence, that was a landmark in the development of national policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must face up to the end of ANZUS as an instrument and expression of defence dependency. Its original form is now no more relevant than those who signed it&mdash;Menzies and Dick Casey&mdash;or the purposes for which it was designed: saving Australia from a renewed Japanese threat to the north and sheltering Australia from communist aggression. In any case, ANZUS has never been formally invoked other than to secure the US bases in Australia. It was not used to justify or sanctify Australia's involvement in Vietnam. It can be argued that, for each of the 43 years of ANZUS, the guarantees allegedly built into the alliance relationship have been non-existent. In his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Breaking the American Alliance</EMPHASIS>, Gary Brown argues persuasively that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . neither the ANZUS Treaty nor the subsidiary arrangements made within its framework actually bind the United States to do anything at all . . . it is entirely the business of the requested partner, not the requesting one, to decide what support (if any) shall be provided in any given case.</PARA>
<PARA>It is time to recast our alliance and relationship with the United States in more realistic terms, recognising the immense changes in the international and security environment since 1951&mdash;particularly in the Asia-Pacific&mdash;and the new goals for the alliance set out in the white paper. ANZUS should not be broken but recast to reflect contemporary issues of mutual advantage for both the United States and Australia; that is, intelligence, technological and logistical cooperation, collective security goals in the Asia-Pacific and the role of the United States in nuclear deterrence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that Australia's geo-political and security interests are unique in the world. It is a middle-ranking power founded as a European settlement which has now evolved as the world's most successful and tolerant multicultural society. It is a large island state with a vast coastline and sparse interior. It is now looking outwards with its economic and trading prosperity closely linked to the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is taking Australia into the world&mdash;and it has been doing it for a decade. That is reflected clearly in the trading prosperity made available by the historic Bogor agreement. It is time to apply the same principles, which are fleshed out substantially in the white paper but perhaps do not go far enough, to the idea of regional security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a government that has done so much to secure Australia's trading and economic prosperity for the next century. It can do as much in terms of securing our regional security by acting on each of the issues raised in the white paper and by embellishing the all-important concepts and opportunities for collective security in our part of the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) on a most interesting and somewhat provocative contribution to the debate today. The security of the nation is a primary responsibility of government. To meet this responsibility, it is necessary to accord a high priority to the formulation and implementation of defence policies which will protect the territorial integrity, the national interest and the people of Australia from external threats. These fundamental responsibilities are acknowledged in the opening paragraphs of the first chapter of Defending Australia. Whether or not this long awaited 1994 defence white paper will deliver the goods in so far as meeting these obligations is concerned, however, is open to considerable conjecture.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the national and international factors which must be taken into account by the defence policy planners of today are very different from those of 30, 20, 10 or even five years ago. We have steadily moved away from a strategy based on the notion of forward defence and have adopted a new, more independent direction with greater emphasis on regional defence considerations. This new direction has been reflected and confirmed in numerous  official Australian government defence statements and policies issued over the last decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1986 the Dibb review defined the new concept of layered defence and the strategy of denial to protect mainland Australia. This major change in policy direction was further developed in the 1987 white paper, The Defence of Australia. Australia's need and intention to develop and maintain a self-reliant defence posture is again reiterated in Defending Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The challenges and complexities of present day defence planning have been amply demonstrated over the past five years. For example, much of the strategy proposed in the 1987 white paper was superseded by the dramatic changes which have taken place in eastern Europe&mdash;changes which were not and arguably could not have been foreseen when the paper was prepared but which have had significant and far-reaching defence and security implications for Australia. During this period, we witnessed the shift from a bipolar world to a multipolar world, from an environment where some degree of predictability existed in regard to potential threats to international security to an atmosphere of uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The world may have changed, but it is still far from safe, stable and secure. The ideological confrontations and considerations of the past have been replaced by new problems, pressures and priorities. There is certainly no cause for complacency. The conflicts in former Yugoslavia and parts of Africa, continuing tensions in the Middle East and Cambodia, the precarious political and economic position in the Commonwealth of Independent States, the widespread  instability in South America, the real and potential threats posed by ethnic and religious differences in many developed and developing countries and the increasing call for the United Nations to intervene in internal confrontations all bear testimony to the volatility of the current international situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decline in the global superpower rivalry has increased the emphasis on regional and national issues and political structures, and the importance of emerging regional alliances. The impact of the collapse of the Soviet Union, together with the reduction in the direct US military presence in the Asia-Pacific region, has already had and will continue to have a substantial effect on regional security. For this reason and others, an essential future requirement for the security of Australia and its territories is the development and maintenance of a self-reliant defence capability, underpinned by cooperative defence alliances and security arrangements with friendly nations. The increasing significance of and requirement for enhanced regional security and defence arrangements has reinforced the need for Australia to continue concentrating on establishing strong relationships within the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Our nation represents a responsible, independent and stabilising influence within the Asia-Pacific region. However, we have not easily or readily been accepted by some of our regional neighbours. Perhaps one reason for this is that in the past, naturally, we tended to concentrate on existing relationships with our traditional British, European and American friends instead of establishing new relationships within our immediate region. We have therefore been perceived as a regional onlooker rather than a regional participant. Australia now recognises and accepts the need for strong regional relationships and we should focus our endeavours on building them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This change of focus must continue as Australia's security and economic future lies with the Asia-Pacific region. The coalition initiated and strongly supports the concept of cooperative regional defence. This involves a range of initiatives aimed at increasing regional defence cooperation and interaction in all areas, from multinational exercises and military training and personnel exchanges to defence industry joint ventures to building improved economic and environmental links with our regional neighbours. It is aimed at complementing rather than replacing Australia's existing network of regional security alliances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is encouraging to see the present government acknowledging the correctness of this approach and following our lead in regard to some of these matters. The development of this regional cooperative approach to defence and security will not be easy. Obviously, other nations in the Asia-Pacific region have different priorities and perceptions in regard to their national security interests, and there are territorial disputes which are still to be resolved. Of particular concern to the present and future security of the Asia-Pacific region are the tensions which persist in Korea, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, southern Africa, Malaysia and New Caledonia. However, it is generally accepted that these current and/or potential confrontations are of a localised nature and do not pose a direct military threat to Australian territory in the foreseeable future. There is considerable evidence to suggest that the favourable strategic environment Australia currently enjoys will continue in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our geographical isolation is one factor quoted in support of this theory. Another factor is that Australia has no immediate and, in all probability, no future strategic interests in the possession of any other nation's territory. However, just as there is a significant difference between military capability and intent, there is also a significant difference between a readily identifiable immediate or potential security risk and the total and permanent absence of any risk whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would be most unwise to assume that, because no threat exists today, no threat will exist tomorrow. Lower level contingencies may arise, possibly without any warning or at very short notice, and Australia must be prepared for unlikely but nonetheless possible changes or developments which may adversely affect the stability of our region and, consequently, our own security. Despite the current popularity and wide acceptance of the no foreseeable threat theory, there are important arguments against this supposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The military history books are bursting with examples of unexpected events which led to unanticipated contingencies, often with disastrous consequences. We need only remember Australia's northern reaches in 1939 and 1940. However, it is reasonable to accept the notion that we are currently in a more advantageous position from a security viewpoint than many other nations, including some of our regional neighbours. In the absence of any immediately or readily identifiable military threat, the definition of national security, the factors affecting it and the means of achieving it have become much broader. Economic, trade and environmental issues and concerns now have to be taken into account in defining security interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a middle power, Australia must continue to play a fundamental role in facilitating greater cooperation and communication within the Asia-Pacific region but, at the same time, we must pursue a broad regional security agenda based on a realistic assessment of our actual regional defence capability. There is no doubt that the larger Asia-Pacific powers, most notably the PRC, India, Japan, Korea and Indonesia, will continue to modernise and build their defence capability and increase their defence readiness as they endeavour to increase their role and influence in the conduct of regional security matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The release in February 1994 of the strategic review was the first major step in adapting Australia's defence and strategic policies to take account of the changed regional and global security environment following the end of the Cold War. It examined the development and challenges which would affect, and proposed short-term policies for, Australia's defence and security over the next three to five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second step is this white paper, which takes a longer term view and defines Australia's security strategies and defence policy directives into the next century. Whilst particular elements of these official government defence and security statements have received a degree of bipartisan political support, there is a continuing and increasing concern in regard to the obvious and unacceptable deterioration in Australia's defence capability over the past 11 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor government's funding priorities have resulted in severe cuts to defence and defence related expenditures and, as a consequence, there has been a dramatic decrease in personnel, equipment and other essential resources. The Australian Deforce Force has been seriously weakened by years of inappropriate and insufficient funding, and its capability to carry out its primary function has now declined to a very critical and precarious level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor's approach to defence funding, both historically and now, has been quite accurately and appropriately described as `champagne taste on a beer drinker's income'. Its policy objectives have generated unrealistic and impossible expectations, and it is hardly surprising that it has been unable to meet the funding demands. Under Labor, expenditure on defence has reached lower relative levels than ever before. During the period 1983-84 to 1993-94, defence spending was reduced from 2.6 per cent to 2.3 per cent of GDP. The latest white paper promises yet further reductions, with defence spending for the medium term set at just two per cent of GDP&mdash;the lowest level for more than 50 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ADF is already in a lamentable state. Permanent force numbers have plummeted to around 60,000, with further reductions imminent. ADF readiness has declined. Cuts to personnel, training, equipment, and other resources have reached a point where morale has suffered almost irreparable damage; and experience and skill levels within all three services have been demonstrably impaired. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Regular Army has been weakened by having two of its six infantry battalions eliminated and replaced with a costly and flawed ready reserve program. This latest white paper proposes that one of these battalions will be re-formed over the next three to four years, but only by cribbing manpower and resources from other areas. The general reserves are likewise suffering from inadequate structures, uncertain directions, imprecise roles and inadequate training resources. None of these problems are adequately addressed in this white paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The defence of our nation should be a matter of paramount concern to all Australians. It is, however, an unfortunate fact that community interest and concern about defence and security issues largely depend on community perceptions about the nature and immediacy of any potential or identifiable threat. Over recent years the security of Australia has, to a considerable extent, been forgotten and/or neglected, and national defence has been replaced on the political agenda by economic and social issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Community understanding of our security needs and public support for, and participation in, Australia's defence effort are fundamental and essential ingredients if we are to achieve and sustain the required and appropriate level of government expenditure on defence portfolio matters. In particular, we must act to increase community awareness of the importance of national defence and security and of the fact that we must be ready and able to defend Australia should the need arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition accepts and supports our nation's need for a strong, viable and ongoing defence capability, but we are not convinced that the government shares our commitment in this regard. We acknowledge that Australia must have a clearly defined and contemporary defence strategy, including a comprehensive policy to create a more proficient and productive defence bureaucracy and ensure a more operationally capable Defence Force. Our attitude to these matters is in stark contrast to the Labor government's underfunded and fragmented efforts over the past decade, which have left Australia vulnerable in the event of any unforeseen contingency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we approach the next century, the primary task of those charged with the responsibility of defending Australia must be to review and rebuild our current defence policy so that it will reflect and be responsive to Australia's future defence and security needs and interests. To date, many of these requirements have not been fulfilled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we delude ourselves if we believe the world today is, and will continue to be, a better and safer place. The fact remains that we live in a dangerous, unstable and rapidly shrinking international environment, where tenuous efforts at peace are overshadowed by simmering political and social unrest, and where the uneven division of scarce resources will continue to test universal goodwill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to speak in support of Defending Australia, the defence white paper 1994. Having a large military base at the Amberley air force base in my electorate, I am always very aware and conscious of the needs of those personnel and their families and of the ability and the commitment of those personnel to defend Australia. I always welcome an opportunity to put on record my appreciation for their commitment to the Defence Force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also put on record my appreciation to those in my electorate at large, who play a very active role in our community. For example, when the Commander of the air force base at Amberley, Air Commodore Rogers, left recently to be promoted, he was given a civic farewell. I wish him well in his new role, as I wish the person who has taken over from him well. It is important that we acknowledge the work that these people do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our defence people have always shown a great commitment. They have managed to grasp and take great advantage of the new technology that is available in this very modern world where technology is the name of the game. We can be very proud of our Defence Force people and of our defence facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This paper is one of the most thorough plans that has been devised for Australia's defence, and it will lay the groundwork for the Australian Defence Force well into the next century. Planning is important, and that is what this paper is all about. It is a rational and carefully planned response to the changing geostrategic situation in the world and, more particularly, in the Asia-Pacific region, which is the important area for us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defending Australia places primary emphasis on the need for the ADF to foster a culture of professionalism and to adapt to the need to employ high-tech defence equipment, which is the way we have been moving for some time. We particularly saw that in the Gulf War situation. On our TV screens we saw the importance of high-tech defence equipment. It is a changing world, and that is the key to the modern battlefield. Perhaps the most welcome news in this paper, and certainly one of the most constructive elements of any defence plan in recent history, is the commitment by the government to a five-year budget allocation to defence, which I am sure will be welcomed by senior people in the Australian Defence Force. That includes a commitment of two per cent of GDP. That can be criticised, but I suggest that our defence people do things more efficiently today than they ever have before. They too realise that the dollar can go only so far; they have been very conscious of that. That is quite evident from my dealings with people in the Defence Force, particularly those at the very senior level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been commentators, such as Michael O'Connor in Monday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, who have raised some initial concerns that two per cent is a bit on the low side. But, as he said in his article, assuming four per cent real growth in GDP, a five-year budget will mean that in 1994 dollars defence will get an increase of some $400 million annually. That is assuming a four per cent growth rate but, as we all know&mdash;and as we will keep reminding those opposite&mdash;the economy is actually growing faster than that, at 6.4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the government will move responsibly to sustain and control this growth, it will remain at a steady rate, high enough to give a real increase to defence under a five-year budget plan. Not only will the five-year budget lead to an increase in defence spending but also it will give the ADF the long-term funding certainty that such an important and large organisation needs to successfully carry out its forward planning. The ADF is a huge organisation and it needs to be able to plan in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So that is how seriously the government views defence&mdash;a real commitment to the security of this country. But what about those opposite? Another point Mr O'Connor made in that article is that the five-year budget requires a corresponding commitment from the opposition both in the Senate and in the extremely unlikely event that it were ever to win government. Day by day that becomes less likely, which is a good thing for Australia. Given this week's showing by the opposition leadership, how can Australians be sure that those opposite are prepared to show the political will required to sustain this defence program?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The defence program needs a bipartisan approach. I call on members opposite to participate in that approach. I know from dealing with our defence people that they see the need for that type of approach. They are not involved in the political arena, of course, but they see the need for the whole parliament to have a strong commitment to our ongoing defence program. A five-year plan like this gives us an opportunity to pick up on that approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper is a response to the changing nature of the global security environment, now that the Cold War is over and the threat from the Soviet Union has virtually disappeared. Simultaneously the security situation in our own region has become more fluid and to some extent less predictable. The withdrawal of the Soviet Union from the major theatres in which it was involved has coincided with an almost unprecedented expansion in the economic growth of the countries in the Asia-Pacific, particularly the ASEAN nations. This will, over time, result in some long-term trends that have the potential to affect our strategic environment, and it is for this contingency that Defending Australia was written. This ASEAN economic growth has been accompanied by expanding military capabilities throughout Asia. Whilst there are no perceived threats, nor are there any potential ones in the foreseeable future, the government is planning the future of Australian defence with the capabilities required to meet these expanding military capabilities in the event of a major change in the regional strategic and political environment. This is perhaps the most important aspect of the white paper&mdash;planning to improve Australia's capacity, in terms of our personnel and equipment policies, to repel any likely attack upon our territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a difficult process to plan for, given the fluid nature of the military situation in this region and the tendency for military capacities to change fairly rapidly, particularly with the greater availability of arms on the global market following the reductions in both the US and Eastern bloc defence forces. This makes it even more important for Australia to initiate policies that will reduce the potential for a military threat. The white paper stresses the importance of partnership with the countries of our region in all areas&mdash;economic, social and military. The Bogor summit is a good example of the economic prosperity that will be delivered to the APEC nations as a result of partnership and cooperation. The same can be said of military cooperation. That partnership is important at all levels, no matter what we are dealing with&mdash;on the economic side, the social side and the military side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only last week the Public Accounts Committee, which I chair, visited New Zealand, our very near neighbour and good friend. I missed what my colleague the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) said earlier but I am sure he would have picked up on this. My colleagues and I had the opportunity to speak to defence people in New Zealand. The spirit of cooperation that exists is very important to both our countries. The goodwill which we found existed between our departments was notable. We spoke to officers at a very senior level in the defence force in New Zealand. We had a lengthy discussion about the ANZAC frigates, which are of mutual interest to us. It was valuable to be able to discuss those things because the relationship between our two countries through CER, in particular, and on the military side and the cooperation that exists between our two countries are essential for our ongoing prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had the opportunity to visit countries such as Papua New Guinea, Western Samoa, Tonga, the Marshall Islands and Micronesia. Some of those places&mdash;in the South Pacific, particularly&mdash;see Australia and New Zealand as very important in developing and maintaining a stable environment in the region. New Zealand plays a key part in that, particularly with those islands to its north, such as Western Samoa and Tonga. This is all part of partnership and cooperation between the two countries. We have to be careful that we are not seen in any way as some sort of Big Brother but rather that we operate on the basis of a partnership. I am sure that is the way most of us think. We ought to develop and prosper that partnership and the cooperation that exists. Fortunately, we are a reasonably large country in terms of the South Pacific nations. They look to us for leadership and, fortunately, that leadership has been shown by our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) not only today but also earlier in the week with the ministerial statement on APEC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In South-East Asia our defence activities will place greater emphasis on partnership with the countries of the region to encourage a more secure, strategic environment by encouraging regular dialogue between countries. The more we do that the better. My colleagues in this place always take the opportunity to develop good relationships when we have the opportunity to meet visiting friends and delegations from other countries. We should put a big emphasis on our local region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's defence relationship with Indonesia is our most important in South-East Asia. The white paper says that close consultation with Indonesia on strategic and defence issues will grow in importance over the coming years. With a huge near neighbour like Indonesia we can develop trade and other relationships. We can be friends, and that is important for us. Similarly, the white paper says that the existing bilateral defence relationships with Singapore and Malaysia will continue to be regarded as very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own electorate of Oxley the Royal Singaporean Air Force has planes at Amberley. It has already made some preliminary approaches to the government to locate a permanent advanced jet training school at a RAAF base in Australia. One of its preferred sites is Amberley because of its location and all the infrastructure that is already there. It is probably logical in some ways, even though some concern has been expressed about an increase in noise levels in the suburban areas. That is something we would need to be mindful of. We are looking at that aspect. Given the infrastructure, however, Amberley seems to be the preferred site. The latest I have on the situation is that we are awaiting a further response from Singapore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The project will involve several hundred RAAF personnel and their families moving into the electorate, in the Ipswich area. While there are still many issues to be resolved, they will be addressed through the appropriate channels. The project is evidence of the level of cooperation that already exists between Australia and some of our regional defence partners. Australia will continue to encourage the constructive involvement of Vietnam and Laos in the security affairs of the region. In Cambodia we will maintain a defence relationship with the new government and provide modest levels of assistance to help reform and modernise its armed forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another good aspect of the white paper is the very serious attempt to encourage Australian industry development in defence policy, which is evident, both for Australia and New Zealand, in the ANZAC frigates. This is consistent with broader government policies which have already encouraged efficient production and work practices and internationally competitive and export oriented Australian manufacturing and services. In 1994-95 some 80 per cent of defence expenditure on facilities, equipment, goods and services will be spent in Australia. This percentage, which represents a major increase over the last decade, results from the high levels of Australian industry involvement in major defence equipment projects like the Collins class submarines, another example of what Australians can do at the high-tech level. Other major defence equipment projects are the ANZAC frigates, the PC3 Orion and the YAREN avionics upgrades, in my own electorate. The latter has been a very important initiative in developing industry in this country. These projects increased the share of capital equipment expenditure in Australia from 25 per cent in 1984-85 to 64 per cent in 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper Defending Australia is an excellent initiative. I congratulate the Minister for Defence on his presentation, and the people who have assisted him in bringing this paper before the parliament.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opening paragraph to the Defending Australia white paper probably says it all in terms of the conventional responsibility of government to look after the maintenance of the defence of the nation. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has a fundamental responsibility to ensure Australia's defence. It meets this responsibility by ensuring that we can prevent or defeat the use of armed force against us.</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is rather cryptic that those comments should be in the introductory paragraph when the reality is that, over the last decade, it has been the policies of this government which have in many respects significantly reduced Australia's defence capability and preparedness. The record speaks for itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have lost two of our six infantry battalions and it is proposed in this white paper that, over the next few years&mdash;without any specific date, I should add&mdash;our defence preparedness will be increased by one battalion. Our fighter force has been reduced from four to three squadrons, although some second-hand aircraft have been purchased from the United States. In real terms we have fewer surface combat craft available to the Royal Australian Navy than we had a decade ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although we are in the process of developing the Collins class submarine&mdash;and the first one is now doing sea trials&mdash;the paper is less than generous in suggesting how far the government will be prepared to go beyond the initial contract, which was to provide for six new submarines. So, while the capability of those submarines will undoubtedly be of a much higher order than the current fleet, the question really is going to be: will there be enough submarines ordered well enough in advance to give us that all-round naval capacity so essential to a nation surrounded by sea? We must have some control of our sea lanes across both the Indian and Pacific oceans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Personnel numbers have dropped by some 20 per cent, and implications of that are covered in the white paper. A recruitment document put out by the army `Your career in a smaller army' puts greater emphasis on technology at the expense of basic manpower. Under various circumstances, a case can be made that high technology is now one of the mainstays of a correctly rounded military force. The fact that our numbers are so low, especially in the army and the navy, demonstrates difficulties that the navy, for example, has in obtaining sufficient crew for its submarines and the obvious difficulties that the army has in maintaining even a semblance of a satisfactory basis for its existing battalions, not to mention the obvious problems it will have under current circumstances to obtain sufficient manpower for the additional battalion proposed in the white paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, conditions of service for defence personnel have also been eroded. We had a paper from the government only three years ago explaining how there was going be a considerable change in the force structure and that would result in a diminution in manpower in various elements of the defence structure. In the last few weeks, however, we have seen a turnaround. There is now almost a panic in the defence forces claiming that there is now a shortage of trained manpower, of a career progression and of a sufficient flow of officer recruits and candidates coming through the system. Clearly that is for two reasons: firstly, the awareness by serving officers of a very limited career prospect. Therefore, many of them, now that the recession, hopefully, is behind us, are looking for greener pastures. Secondly, there is an effect on the quality of recruitment as well as the numbers of recruits because of the alternatives available to young men and women in the Australian private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue worth noting in the context of recent policy is the establishment of the ready reserve scheme. We are told in the white paper that, despite the complaints and fears which were voiced by our respective shadow ministers for defence in this place and in the Senate over recent years, the government pushed ahead with the establishment of the ready reserve. We warned the government that there were going to be problems, and now it is admitting that those problems exist and, consequently, it has announced a further investigation into the effectiveness of the scheme. The related scheme, which is in a wider context, particularly with its involvement in the private sector, is the commercial support program, which again, regrettably, has in many respects failed to deliver the efficiencies and the savings which were heralded of it long before the event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, we have our concerns about this document. In many respects it is a weak document. In many respects it is little more than an attempt to excuse the government for its failures over recent years while at the same time trying to make much of the fact that so many promises of change are contained in it. These changes may or may not ultimately be seen, but they are skated over in the document as reviews, investigations and examinations&mdash;in fact, the list is almost endless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's record on the adequate funding of defence again does not take very close examination. It was foreshadowed in the previous defence paper&mdash;this was back in 1987&mdash;that defence expenditure would be between 2.6 and three per cent of GDP. It can be demonstrated from examination of the statistics that the budget allocations in this financial year will in fact be lower than for the last year of the Whitlam government. The government would claim that, with the end of the Cold War, the whole strategic environment in which Australia finds itself has so changed that there is no threat in the foreseeable future and there is no nation in our region capable or apparently politically willing to enter into a war-like situation with Australia. All I can to say to that is that I sincerely hope the government is right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great lessons through history has been that it takes much longer to gird a nation's loins for battle&mdash;to use the language of Winston Churchill&mdash;than it does to plan sufficiently in advance to make sure that, in the event of a threat, you are ready for it to a significant degree. Every time this nation has been caught out, it has been because governments of the day&mdash;sadly, including the Labor Party leading up to the Second World War&mdash;have supported a policy of disarmament and have not been prepared to face up to the clouds appearing on the horizon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the white paper does so little to redress the failures of defence policy in the past, the question really has to be asked: is it adequately planning for the future? As I have said, the 1987 white paper was inaccurate in terms of its projections on defence budgeting. It projected 2.6 to three per cent of gross domestic product and it never got anywhere near it. In 1994-95 it is now $2.5 billion lower in defence terms than the 1987 white paper promised. Consequently, if you add up those shortfalls since 1987, it effectively means that the Defence Force has been cut in budgetary terms by no less than $11 billion&mdash;a significant sum of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only commitment the white paper makes in terms of the future, and it is the sort of commitment that it made in the previous documents, is that the level of defence expenditure will be `approximately'&mdash;a wonderful word for politicians to use&mdash;two per cent of gross domestic product over the next few years. Two per cent could perhaps vary from three per cent to one per cent and they will still call it `approximate'. The government also claims that, whatever the outcome of defence expenditure, it is not really a problem because we are going to have economic growth and, of course, economic growth in real terms will result in a real increase in defence expenditure. Amen to that. Let us hope the government is right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sad fact is that the rises and falls of the economic cycle in recent decades should be telling any government one salient story: that the peaks and the troughs are getting closer together. Therefore, the difficulties of running an effective financial long-term projection over at least five years, which you must do for defence purposes, is something I believe the government has not been adequately able to achieve. The evidence of the last 11 years, in all its white papers, promises and commitments, has that one salient link&mdash;that is, they were all significantly below what was initially intended for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Putting it quite simply, you cannot have defence on the cheap. It costs money to be prepared. It costs money to have men and women who are prepared to dedicate their lives in the service of Australia. It costs money to have the best equipment to support those people in the most critical work of supporting the nation. When I saw in the white paper the government's commitments to the future, I could not help but ask that rather interesting question about Napoleon. When Napoleon had a general who caused him difficulties&mdash;and often that occurred, especially during his Russian campaign when they froze to death in the snows of the Siberian winter&mdash;his response invariably was: if he is complaining, give him another medal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fair to say that this government in recent years has produced more new medals than any government in Australia's history. That may give people a warm inner glow. People who have given service to the nation expect to be honoured; they expect to be respected. But let there be no doubt that a chest full of medals is neither an excuse nor a substitute for giving soldiers the best possible technological support and training you can because in the moment of battle it is the quality of the equipment they are supplied with and the quality of the training they have had which, in so many cases, will be the difference between life and death. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that medals under those circumstances are no substitute&mdash;none whatsoever&mdash;for the reality of a government taking the matter much more seriously than it has in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note the lists of items which are in the white paper as being subject to review. They are, for example, military satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles, fixed seabed acoustic arrays, AWACs&mdash;something we have been asking the government to introduce for years&mdash;the structural land force, the ready reserves, the two Collins class submarines, which may yet be added to the basic fleet structure; and so the list goes on. What I notice is not there is the capacity for Australia to be able to project its military force into the region which we know to be our primary defence responsibility and interest, namely, the south-west Pacific region leading up to the mainland of Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one area in which I do support the government's proposals, and that is closer links with our regional partners, notably Indonesia. It is worth noting that Singapore, for example, has been training its forces, especially its air force, in Australia for some time. That is a very useful method of maintaining close links with that nation, especially when being so small it has very real limitations on the capacity of its air force to operate in a training environment. Sharing training with our neighbours helps them to understand us. It certainly helps our personnel to understand them. That can, in time, as those officers on both sides increase in rank and stature in their respective forces, create precisely the atmosphere of peace, consultation and the capacity to work together which is fundamental to those situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of us who have had any relationship with defence training arrangements, as I did before I came into parliament, remember only too well that possibly the most important example of all was the defence forces of Indonesia. Going back to the days of the Sukarno regime, a significant number of its officers were trained in the Soviet Union. There were two groups of officers: those which came through the United States system and those which came through the Russian system. For a long time there was a degree of friction in that relationship. The military philosophy was different. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), who is at the table, for extending this debate on my behalf. As the shadow minister, I would have been higher up the list had it not been for the fact that I have been attending the Defence Force Academy graduation ceremony this morning, along with the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Punch). It was an extremely impressive parade of young people, of whom we can all be very proud. Unfortunately for them, it rained throughout the entire parade, for which I was extremely sorry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last month or so I have been raising a number of questions relative to recruitment and manning in the services. As shadow minister in that area, it is a matter of considerable concern to me. As I hope I have demonstrated throughout my involvement as shadow minister for veterans' affairs&mdash;and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) thanked me the other day for the cooperation I have provided&mdash;I hope I can continue in this role. I do not want in these very serious areas to be playing politics at a ridiculous level. Consequently, I have put some fairly low level questions to the minister, and the minister has responded according to the advice he has received from his department. I am not, therefore, arguing at this point in time that he has misled the House in any of the remarks he has made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Nevertheless, when it comes to the defence of our country, when it comes to public safety, one's responsibilities are easy to see. I am hopeful that some of the remarks I make today will cause the minister to question some of the advice he is apparently receiving. I want to address a special area of manning, which is the issue I have been addressing&mdash;that is, the numbers and the ability to deliver proper services of air traffic controllers. The interesting thing is that the minister, for instance, informed me on 3 November by way of letter in response to a question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the outset, let me say that I am advised in very strong terms by Air Force that the current staffing level of the air traffic control function is satisfactory in terms of providing safe and effective control of airspace . . .</PARA>
<PARA>If I can just go back a moment, I would imagine that of all people employed by government the people less likely to leak would be the armed services. They have a genuine commitment to what they are doing. When they start to leak, I think it has to be a message to government that something is seriously afoot. I was able to send that letter I received from the minister to a very senior officer, who replied. I want to read some of the comments. In the beginning, under `Introduction', he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the letter from the Hon. Gary Punch MP dated 3 November 1994 in which he replies to your Questions Without Notice of 18 October 1994 regarding air traffic controllers in the RAAF.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Primarily, the letter is an official fabrication which uses inaccurate and out of date statistics to prove a point. The present day realities no longer represent the picture in his letter. I shall begin by discussing the contentious statements in the letter which you sent and then detail some of the peripheral issues . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on, under the heading `Current Staffing Levels within ATC':</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Manning within the RAAF ATC is now approaching a critical stage. Despite the return to Australia of the air traffic controllers (ATCOs) who served in Somalia and other UN posts, there are insufficient numbers of qualified controllers to man the various controlling positions at the Bases. Such is the parlous state of this category that an urgent meeting was convened on the 4th of November this year at Air Force Office in Canberra (see Annex A attached)&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which is the minutes of that meeting&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to discuss means by which ATC services and manning problems could be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of writing this report to you, the Minutes of this meeting had not been released. However, I am aware that the Minutes (written by a member from the Directorate of Personnel Officers&mdash;Air Force . . . in which the postings, promotion and career paths of officers are managed) of the meeting were not considered to be a true reflection . . .</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, people at the very top were trying to rewrite the history of that particular meeting. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an expectation that in the next fiscal year, the RAAF will lose upwards of 24 controllers who will join Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). I will detail in later paragraphs the reasons for the dissatisfaction within the RAAF. CAA is currently recruiting personnel to undertake both the short term, and the long term (two years) ATC courses. Discussions with my senior counterparts in CAA reveal that CAA is also desperately short of controllers, hence their recruiting campaign. I am to understand that CAA is keen to recruit 24 trainees per year . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, at the top of page 2 in Punch's letter, there is an acknowledgment of possible `fluctuations' in manning of RAAF controllers.</PARA>
<PARA>In the letter he goes on to say that the air force has increased its recruiting and training rate of ATCOs&mdash;air traffic controllers. He then says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ironically, it was at the 4NOV meeting where the issue of recruiting ATCOs was discussed at length. The issue of how best to attract potential controllers into the RAAF is not without difficulties. Consider the differences in salaries . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He then has a subnote, which states in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, an approach controller at Mascot or Melbourne would expect to receive a salary, inclusive of penalty rates, of close to $70,000 pa. The military counterpart would be of flight lieutenant rank and would have a gross salary of approx. $40,000 pa.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on and explains those disparities in salaries. He then says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the initiatives discussed at the 4NOV meeting in Canberra to help reduce manning shortfalls is to recall many of the trained controllers who are currently employed `out of category' (OOC). I shall attempt to provide a brief explanation of what is entailed in OOC employment. Senior flight lieutenants or squadron leaders within ATC are oftentimes given the opportunity to `broaden their career path' by being selected to undertake employment in other fields. They are employed in a wide range of duties from administration, materiel divisions to working with DPO-AF as an example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, whilst many of these officers will be recalled to the control environment, they will be required to have refresher training and undertake rigid rating exams to re-qualify as active controllers.</PARA>
<PARA>That sounds infinitely sensible to me. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite the denials which may emanate to the contrary, many of these controllers will have been away from active controlling for a long period and may well experience significant difficulty in attaining the required standards of control. It is not unrealistic to believe that many will not be able to cope with the demands of a system in which they have not been a practising part of for several years.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister, in his reply to me yesterday, said that they were just going to click these people back into operations. Another contentious issue in the minister's letter is that which relates to MTAF. The minister in his letter pointed out that they were using control in many areas known as MTAF. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Be assured in the strongest possible terms, MTAF was only accepted as a last resort from within the RAAF. The introduction of this system into the military came about only when there were insufficient numbers of controllers to meet the operational demands at the Bases. The Air Headquarters at Glenbrook NSW vehemently rejected military ATC moves to introduce this method of procedure. Despite the paucity of available controllers to undertake out of hours operations, seniors in the Air Headquarters continued to insist that military aircraft should not operate from airfields without the assistance of ATC. This situation reached a crisis point several months past when the Pearce Base rejected a proposed series of out of hours movements of Air Headquarters aircraft&mdash;based on nothing more than the critical manning situation which existed at the Pearce ATC section. Reluctantly, permission was granted by Air Headquarters to allow the aircraft to operate using the MTAF procedures. The system is now widely accepted!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to how the Minister views MTAF being ` . . . a high level of safety without air traffic control' the system is certainly not without danger.</PARA>
<PARA>MTAF is a basis used in commercial operations where there is no air traffic control, but you tell everybody where you are on the radio. We are talking about aircraft now in the air force that do 1,000 kilometres an hour and are specifically designed to be as unobservable as possible. Of course, the pilots have little tiny windows, and they cannot see much either. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Considering the speed at which many of the military aircraft fly, a radio transmission by the pilot stating his callsign, type of aircraft, position and his intentions are of little consequence to another pilot flying in the same proximity in an aircraft of considerably less performance capability. Undeniably, the high performance military aircraft which oftentimes have restrictive cockpit vision capability require positive control and that can only be provided by air traffic control . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">MTAF has only been introduced at military establishments because of the existing shortfalls in manning&mdash;despite whatever reassurances emanate from Canberra to the contrary. Military controllers have always accepted the requirement to be on duty for aircraft operations. Even in the case of single aircraft movement . . . However, when manning cuts at the bases reduced controller numbers, it became unmanageable to roster controllers for out of hours movements. MTAF was accepted as a means by which flying operations could be sustained&mdash;but without the need of ATC. In discussing controller numbers and how bases can be manned, we should address a new initiative which was discussed on 4 NOV&mdash;priority manning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the Training Command in Melbourne (responsible for ATC and operations at East Sale (VIC) and Pearce (WA)) have been required to nominate those Bases at which priority manning should be afforded. In the case of the Darwin Base (which belongs to Air Headquarters)&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and in Darwin the RAAF provides all commercial air traffic control&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Manning has been increased to 100 per cent. The Senior Air Traffic Controller (SATCO) became frustrated at the number of unsuccessful attempts he had made to have his manning deficiencies addressed. He issued a NOTAM (notice to airmen) stating in effect that due to manning constraints within his Section&mdash;aircraft could expect delays and consequently, they were instructed to carry additional fuel.</PARA>
<PARA>We are talking now of commercial aircraft coming in from overseas. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">QANTAS was outraged and complained to the Minister for Defence&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>so apparently he must know something about all this&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">at the cost that this requirement would have on their operations into and out of Darwin. The Minister immediately responded by ordering Darwin's ATC manning to be raised to 100 per cent&mdash;despite that controllers had to be taken from other Bases which were already short in manpower. Effectively, it was the scenario of `robbing Peter to pay Paul'.</PARA>
<PARA>I am still quoting from the letter from a very senior RAAF officer. He then says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this latest case of prioritising within the Training Command Bases, the School of Air Traffic Control (SATC) at East Sale is to be manned to one hundred per cent: Pearce&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>in my state&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will also be high on this priority list . . .</PARA>
<PARA>There is a good reason for that: the minister has just been over there opening the new training facility for the Singaporean air force; it now trains at Pearce, Western Australia. There have been government to government discussions between the Singapore government and the Australian government about us not keeping our side of the bargain, which of course included providing adequate air traffic control to its trainee pilots. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, I am going to run out of time, but let me just touch on this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SATC has to be fully manned if the expected numbers of controllers are going to be trained in the next several years. There will be a concentrated effort in graduating students from a Basic ATC Course. However, the benefits of this training will not be fully achieved until those controllers have undertaken the advanced course (some two to three years following graduation from the initial course).</PARA>
<PARA>So we are talking of a period of up to four years before people can be left on their own and be adequately capable of controlling the sky for which they would be responsible. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are already considerable concerns being raised at the flying bases at the prospect of losing controllers to make up the shortfalls at Pearce and SATC. Undoubtedly, further cuts to air traffic control services must be anticipated until the shortfalls in the manning situation eases. Perhaps the most significant effect on manning has stemmed from the series of reviews on manpower undertaken within the ADF.</PARA>
<PARA>There is so much of this that I will just go to the conclusion. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response to Minister Punch's letter contains out of date information and figures which belie the real situation. The play on statistics has long been a way in which the truth can be hidden. In this letter, the same can be said for the situation governing the numbers of qualified RAAF controllers who are currently in the field providing services. You will note that this number is substantially less than `the number of air traffic controllers in the RAAF'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recruiting, if successful, will not produce the first fully rated and operational controllers before three years. Prioritized manning at several of the bases can only be achieved by taking personnel from other ATC sections . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dissatisfaction amongst many of the controllers stems from their professional concerns that manpower reductions have led to reductions in supervision, poor quality control of their rating standards and an expected demand for quality services which their numbers are having difficulty in providing. Most controllers are appalled at their prospects of a worthwhile career in the RAAF.</PARA>
<PARA>The government must address these issues. It is no good just having the minister coming in here and saying, `I am advised of this' and, `I am advised of that.' I beg him to make his own inquiries. I beg him to find out what is going on before we have the situation that occurred in the civilian sector, where people were killed. The minister tried to play this down, but we have already been advised that in the Williamtown area a commuter aircraft entered restricted airspace while two Macchis were in the area firing guns. Luckily, no-one was hit. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to these bills having been a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts which produced report No. 296, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Auditor-General: ally of the people and the parliament</EMPHASIS>. It was a report which I and others on that committee&mdash;and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), who is sitting across the table from me, was the chair at that time&mdash;produced after long and serious investigation. The report we produced recommended that the Auditor-General should be properly recognised as the linchpin for proper accountability and that he should be a link between the people and the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accountability is something that must constantly be talked about in this place because, again and again, from my perspective, accountability standards are dropping. The focal point of report No. 296 was the need for the Auditor-General to be free of the power of the executive. At the present time, the resources of the Auditor-General come from the executive and, in a very real sense, the government of the day or the executive of the day has the power to curtail the functions of the Auditor-General by curtailing the amount of funding that is made available to him and to his office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Joint Committee of Public Accounts looked at precedents around the world. It said that the Auditor-General should be freed from the control of the executive and that a committee of the parliament should be established. In report No. 296, the JCPA recommended that that committee should be chaired by a Presiding Officer and that it should be a separate committee which would oversight the amount of money made available to the Auditor-General. In report No. 331, which was brought down later by the Public Accounts Committee, of which I was no longer a member&mdash;and, indeed, neither was the minister&mdash;there was a change and it was recommended that the JCPA could conduct that function itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concept of the need for an audit committee is a very important one. With the legislation rejecting the recommendations made by both report No. 296 and report No. 331, the audit committee is not to be enshrined in legislation. Instead it is to be appointed by resolution&mdash;a resolution we have yet to see. The very important appointment of the Auditor-General himself, rather than being in accordance with the JCPA recommendation&mdash;that is, approved by the Leader of the Opposition and the chairman of the audit committee&mdash;is now merely to be by consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), in his speech on the second reading motion, said that the coalition will be moving an amendment in that area. It is a very important and fundamental point. On that question of consultation, it is not very hard to see how easily lip-service could be given to that concept so that it has no real meaning at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second of the most important principles underlying the recommendations of the JCPA was that the Auditor-General should have confirmed, once and for all, his mandate to audit all government departments and instrumentalities, including GBEs. It was our intention that that mandate should include not only financial statement audits but also performance and efficiency audits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is pleasing to see that the mandate has been enshrined in legislation, across the board, for financial statements. It is exceedingly disappointing to see that the Auditor-General does not have the right to do efficiency audits of GBEs and other instrumentalities. With the practice of corporatisation, and with more and more activities of government being pushed off the balance sheet, the need for scrutiny and accountability has grown, not lessened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There must always be different standards for the public sector and the private sector. They are not the same. In the private sector, an individual may choose to invest his or her money as he or she sees fit. If that person does not like what the chosen company is doing, he or she may pull the money out and put it somewhere else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the public sector there is no such right. Money is acquired compulsorily, by way of taxation, and is invested and spent according to government policy of the day. A taxpayer has no say on how that money is used. The checks and balances that exist in the private sector simply do not exist in the public sector, and that strict demarcation needs to be adhered to. The Auditor-General, the official officer of the parliament, as we like to think of him&mdash;the ally of the people in the parliament&mdash;needs to be able to carry out his audit function in terms not only of financial statements but of efficiency audits as well. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Mrs BISHOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He should be an impartial judge. If, in fact, the only way in which an efficiency audit can be done is by the minister asking for it to be done or by a resolution of both houses, it effectively will never be done. I vividly remember speaking about the need for audits and investigations of various functions of government instrumentalities to be carried out, and the power for the Auditor-General to carry out his task so that the JCPA could look at the resulting audit and look at the question simply was not there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fourth important point underlying those reports was the need for the Auditor-General to have the ability to employ staff at market rates&mdash;in other words, to be freed from the obligation to employ under the Public Service Act. The reason for this was very simple. The work of the Auditor-General is becoming more and more complex and complicated, and he needs to have the very best people at his disposal. He needs to be able to go to the market and employ people, in the service of the parliament, to enable the best auditing function to be carried out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Saying that the Auditor-General does not have that power means that, again, his function is being constrained. When the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley) spoke to these bills, he mentioned that the Auditor-General's office was to become a statutory authority. He said it was a `symbolic' move. That was the right word to use. It is indeed symbolic: it is window dressing. Unless the Auditor-General is given the power to go outside to the market to choose the best people to come and do those audits, symbolic is what the change will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about the office of the Auditor-General, we have to make a distinction between the people who man that office and the rest of the Public Service. Many in the Public Service consider that the Auditor-General is the enemy. Yet, as we have said in that title to report 296, he is the ally of the people and the parliament; he is the man whom we depend upon to give us information which we then as members of parliament can use to see whether or not there is correct expenditure and true accountability and in turn be accountable to the public, the people who vote for us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I was on the Public Accounts Committee we had several important inquiries. One was the result of a public servant telling us that he had lied to an estimates committee. The Public Accounts Committee inquiry that ensued came up with the most remarkable result that the members of the Public Accounts Committee had to write a recommendation that when people become public servants they must be informed that they are actually subject to the constitution and acts of parliament, including the Audit Act. It was amazing to hear evidence that there were public servants who thought they were somehow not subject to the law of the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To stress the importance of accountability at every turn is important. When I look at the bills that have come before us and I see the recommendations that have not been followed, I can only say that this legislation that has been introduced must be only step one because, until the important principles that underlie the very fabric upon which the Auditor-General can truly be seen to be independent of the executive, we are not giving the Auditor-General the power that he needs to carry out the function that we require of him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take just a few minutes to mention the question of Centenary House. The problem with Centenary House remains precisely the same after the inquiry has been carried out as it was before the inquiry. The problem is twofold. Firstly, we have the Auditor-General as a tenant of a political party. If people choose to go through the debates, they will see that I pointed out again and again that the Auditor-General must also be seen to be above any suggestion of influence. For the Auditor-General to be a tenant of any political party, to me, is abhorrent. Secondly, the Auditor-General's tenancy has been used as a mechanism to transfer a total of $86 million out of the taxpayers' pockets into the pocket of the Australian Labor Party. Despite our strict disclosure laws, an advantage is given to one particular party&mdash;that being the Labor Party&mdash;through a lease by the government, a Labor Party government. I find that an absolute disgrace and believe it will remain a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In speaking to this legislation today, I can only express my sincere disappointment that the specific recommendations concerning those four aspects that I have raised have not been followed. These recommendations included the appointment of the Auditor-General; the creation by way of legislation of an audit committee and the functions which it should have to free the Auditor-General and his office from the executive arm of government; the mandate for audits to extend to performance audits; and the ability to employ people in accordance with the dictates of the market and thus give the best people to the office of Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other areas in the other two bills which also give me cause for concern but only because of the basic statement that I made at the beginning of my speech&mdash;that there is a distinction between accountability for the public sector and accountability for the private sector. So I regard these bills as only step one. I think there is a lot more to be done to ensure that our Auditor-General is truly an ally of the people and the parliament. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General Bill 1994 creates an office of Auditor-General. It spells out the powers and functions of this office and is supposed to guarantee an independent role for the Auditor-General. This bill has been the cause of most of the controversy surrounding the total proposals. The present Auditor-General, Mr J.C. Taylor, has been critical of the Auditor-General Bill 1994 for several reasons. These criticisms flowed on from and largely reinforced the recommendations made by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the JCPA, in its report 296 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Auditor-General: ally of the people and parliament</EMPHASIS>. I will return to examine some of the recommendations contained in the report later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Financial Management and Accountability Bill is concerned with regulatory accounting and an accountability framework for dealing with the management of Commonwealth property and money. It deals with the finances of departments and government agencies. It also applies to Commonwealth statutory bodies which do not have legal ownership and control over their finances and property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill introduces a single set of core reporting and auditing requirements for Commonwealth authorities and sets out the standards of conduct for executive officers. These new standards aim to require authorities to adopt standards comparable with those set out in the Corporations Law, amongst other things. This bill will also provide a single set of requirements to ensure wholly owned Commonwealth companies keep ministers and the parliament properly informed on their activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The three bills come at a time when there are many changes occurring in the public sector, such as a continuing move towards the introduction of accrual based accounting throughout the public sector, increased interest in accountability of government, increased financial independence of departments and agencies, devolution of responsibilities and a growing interest in program efficiency audits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All these developments and more have come from the inadequacies in the existing act, the principal act, as they became increasingly more apparent. This is especially so in terms of the operation of the Australian National Audit Office. There is no doubt that the Auditor-General plays a critical role in furthering the aim of accountability in relation to government programs and that accountability is designed to stem from and to the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date, the functions of audit and review have largely been conducted by the Auditor-General through the ANAO, although I should say that the ANAO is not the sole agency by which programs receive necessary scrutiny. Senate estimates committees play a useful role, as do other means of inquiry, such as those conducted by various parliamentary committees, whistleblowers, freedom of information requests and, last but not least, questions on notice in this House. All these types of inquiry play a significant role, although some are more important and others, such as freedom of information requests, turn out in most instances to be a bureaucratic and futile exercise. However, I will get to that again later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian National Audit Office, fortunately, does not suffer the sorts of limitations that are placed upon members of parliament who seek information, because the ANAO has a right and a duty to examine government programs to ensure that they operate appropriately. Of late we have seen several reports by the Auditor-General which have demonstrated Labor's lack of administrative ability. The report into the community, cultural, recreation and sporting facilities program, which became known as the sports rorts report, was one of the best because it showed that this government will stoop to anything to maintain its tenuous grasp on power. No-one will ever forget the pathetic figure of the member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) trying to cover up her deliberate attempts at pork-barrelling in the run-up to the 1993 election, and in the process misleading the parliament&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And defended by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The program was conducted with the full knowledge of the Prime Minister. Fortunately, the Auditor-General was able to examine this program and expose the gross misuse of public funds by the member for Canberra on behalf of Labor. Other reports by the Auditor-General which have received substantial amounts of publicity are those examining the Child Support Agency and the Australian government credit card scams. These reports were damning of shoddy administrative procedures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No matter how successful the Auditor-General has been, limitations to his powers and operational ability do exist. The ANAO is subject to a lack of resources and consequently cannot perform at a level that is necessary to achieve a satisfactory number of audits. Several inhibiting factors have been brought to light in the JCPA report No. 296. The ANAO can only undertake efficiency audits of government programs with an expenditure in excess of $10 million once every 40 years. This means that most of those programs will never receive an efficiency audit. This is an absolute disgrace, with program managers and ministers being able to rort some programs in the knowledge that they will suffer an efficiency audit only if they are extremely unlucky. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the number of agencies and statutory authorities has increased markedly&mdash;for statutory authorities the number has increased since 1977-78 from under 100 to be now more than 200&mdash;and the total number of financial transactions has increased rapidly, the dollar amount spent on audit office wages and salaries has not increased since 1978-79. In fact, at the time of the publishing of the JCPA report, the amount spent on salaries had fallen from $20.8 million to $20.6 million, and that is not adjusted for inflation. Funding actually did increase in the late 1980s, but these moneys were mainly used to equip the ANAO with a new computing system. The fact remains that the resources given to the ANAO are not sufficient for it to operate at a level that might be otherwise reasonably expected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The JCPA found that it was inconclusive whether ANAO had sufficient resources for financial and compliance audits, but it found the resources for efficiency audits were totally inadequate. Of the many recommendations made in the JCPA report, three are central to giving the ANAO the necessary muscle to perform to its best in the public interest. These are: providing the Auditor-General with the unfettered authority to undertake performance audits on all Commonwealth owned and controlled agencies, companies, et cetera; the establishment by law of an audit committee to oversee the annual estimates of the ANAO, and this committee could be constituted by the JCPA; and the parliament establishing the ANAO as a statutory authority with the power to set terms and conditions of employment for staff, including salary levels, and ensuring that the parliament shall bear the cost of all financial statement audits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are very good reasons for these recommendations, which have been spelt out by both the JCPA and the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General should be able to undertake audits on all Commonwealth agencies and wholly owned companies to strengthen their public accountability and to maximise the flow of financial information available to ministers and, most importantly, to the parliament. This is essential so that the parliament makes sound laws that affect Commonwealth companies and to maintain the executive government's accountability to the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal to establish an Audit Committee of the Parliament and to have the ANAO's annual estimates overseen by such a committee is important to ensuring the independence of the Auditor-General from political pressure. The Auditor-General should report to the parliament and should be accountable only to the people's elected representatives. The independence of the Auditor-General from the pressures of an incumbent government is essential to establishing a worthwhile audit, especially program efficiency audits. Currently, it is the Department of Finance, the DOF, which advises the government on the resources to be made available to the ANAO. This is also an obvious inhibitor to the independence of the ANAO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no surprise that the efficiency audits have not been conducted by the Auditor-General on programs administered by the Department of Finance, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Department of Treasury. No doubt the Auditor-General and his staff would be highly reluctant to engage in efficiency audits in such key departments if they believed they could not report without fear or favour and a negative report could result in a reduction of resources. That is why the ANAO should be dependent only on the proposed committee and, through it, the parliament for the resources needed to employ staff and to operate effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendation that the ANAO should become a statutory authority and be able to set the terms and conditions of employed staff is a proposal of great merit. In recent years it has been very difficult for the ANAO to hold on to experienced staff. Better packages are on offer in the private sector, with the money differential continuing to widen. This is especially so in the area of computer audits, where there is a shortage of skilled people and the private sector easily outbids the ANAO. If the Auditor-General is going to attract high calibre staff and is going to retain them, the ANAO must be able to set out its own conditions for the employment of staff. The operations of the ANAO are too important for any government to be tying the Auditor-General's hands behind his back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that the ANAO suffers a lack of resources to conduct more widespread efficiency audits. The reports that I have already mentioned are no doubt just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to poor program administration and, in some cases, the downright abuse of programs to further the government's re-election plans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of late, in-house program reviews have been growing in popularity amongst departments and agencies. Such reviews make sense if only to assess whether program objectives are being met and to measure and oversee progress being made with continuing programs. Unfortunately, when it comes to fundamental reviews which examine the appropriateness, effectiveness and efficiency of a program, in-house reviews are usually a complete waste of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date, program evaluations that are written internally do little more than present a flowery review of performance. Internal reviews are conducted only to substantiate the amount of money being expended on programs and to develop a rationale for greater funding in the next budget. It is difficult for departmental officers to evaluate their own department's programs without fear or favour and still hope to have a career in the same department. That is a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, it has come to my attention that an internal review of the Department of Tourism's role in the 1992 Seville expo was written earlier this year but is still to see the light of day. The department claims the report is not yet finalised. It is, but the department refuses to circulate the report because it is so damning. This is an example of an in-house review which is objective&mdash;a rare report indeed. However, the chances are that it will never see the light of day. The fact remains that if reports that examine the worth of programs are to be of any real use to the agency they relate to, or to other agencies, they should be publicly available and would best be written by the ANAO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Tourism also has a program, called the forest ecotourism program, for which grants for the 1992-93 financial year were targeted towards marginal Labor electorates. Apparently, senior officers were first asked to divvy up the proposals&mdash;the loot&mdash;according to electorate, but they refused. Their reasoning was that the request was too political and not in keeping with the role of public servants. Junior officers were then ordered to divvy up the proposals according to electorates. This they did, with the majority of grants going towards marginal Labor seats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the information I have received is accurate, this program in the 1992-93 year was as corrupt as the sports rorts affair. This program has never experienced an efficiency audit and is a classic example of why programs need more intensive scrutiny from the Auditor-General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned earlier that there are other means by which programs receive scrutiny, such as estimates committees, questions on notice and freedom of information procedures. If freedom of information is to play a worthwhile role, it needs to be greatly reformed. It is a travesty that those who take a keen interest in the operations of government programs are unable to access documents that detail the performance of the programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of an example, I requested information from the Department of Industrial Relations that related to its reviews and evaluations of the workplace reform program and the best practice program. The department obviously fears accountability. As a result, it has quoted me a fee of $4,960 to gain access to certain relevant documents under the Freedom of Information Act 1982. If a member of parliament has difficulties in accessing such information by means of freedom of information laws, due to the cost and administrative hassles, what chance do others have?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there are departments and agencies which refuse to provide requested documents, in flagrant breach of the act. Few citizens would have the patience or financial resources to pursue these departments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, as they are able to, or to the Commonwealth Ombudsman. The behaviour of many departments in dealing with FOI requests is nothing less than obstructionist. They do not want to be held accountable by the people of Australia, who provide the taxes which fund their programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, the purpose of the FOI act is to facilitate access to information, not to find new ways to withhold that information. Accountability of the government to the Australian people and parliament is essential and of paramount importance. To make this accountability meaningful, the Auditor-General must be given the powers and independence to carry out efficiency audits in the whole of the Commonwealth sector, including wholly Commonwealth owned companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As such, the government should accept the coalition's amendments. The government should also change the Freedom of Information Act to ensure a right to information, with departments having to substantiate fully their reasons for not providing requested information. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 contains the amendments announced by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) on 6 April 1994. These amendments inject much needed flexibility into the administration of the scheme and close an emerging loophole where some people were avoiding their child support obligations, again placing responsibility for the financial support of their children onto the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These twin objectives have been achieved by increasing the administrative role of the CSA in some areas, extending the rights of parents to enter into private payment arrangements, ensuring private child support agreements entered into by DSS clients provide adequate levels of child support, and aligning the child support presumptions of parentage with those in the Family Law Act 1975. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">1. Presumptions of parentage</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill brings the presumptions of parentage in the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 into line with the presumptions used in the Family Law Act 1975. Currently, the child support presumptions are limited to those where some documentary evidence exists as a basis for the presumption&mdash;for example, a child born during marriage. This bill also allows the registrar to be satisfied that a man is a parent of a child where:</PARA>
<PARA>.that child was born to a woman married to that man within 10 months after their marriage has been annulled;</PARA>
<PARA>.that child was born to a woman who was married to that man, separated from him, resumed cohabitation for not more than three months and separated again, and that child was born within 10 months after cohabitation ended and after the dissolution of their marriage; or</PARA>
<PARA>.that child was born to a woman who cohabited with that man for a period of at least six months and this period included the time 10 months before the birth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aligning the child support presumptions of parentage with those of the Family Law Act will streamline the administrative arrangements in place between the Child Support Agency and the Department of Social Security. Currently, many custodial parents who apply for child support are required to obtain a birth certificate or a statutory declaration from the father. This can take months, and causes needless hardship to children and custodial parents deprived of support during this period. It can also create substantial arrears of child support for the non-custodial parent when the necessary proof is obtained, causing his or her liability to be backdated to the time the application was made. The administrative delays associated with obtaining this paperwork have contributed to significant criticism of the scheme. This amendment will largely remove this problem. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">2. Child Support Agreements</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A study conducted by the Department of Social Security has indicated that 80 per cent of agreements registered with the Child Support Agency are for amounts less than formula assessment. On average, these agreements are for 50 per cent less than the formula assessment. This has the effect of transferring responsibility for the financial support of the children to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To remedy this emerging loophole in the interaction between child support and social security legislation, the bill requires the registrar to accept child support agreements for custodial parents receiving an income tested pension, benefit or allowance when these agreements meet the Department of Social Security's requirement that the custodial parent take reasonable action to obtain maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parents will remain free to negotiate agreements that contain a mixture of periodic, non-periodic and capitalised maintenance. However, if the custodial parent is receiving an income tested pension, benefit or allowance the combined value of cash and non-cash components in the agreement must provide adequate levels of child support. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">3. Non-enforcement of certain Stage 1 cases</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for the non-enforcement of amounts of maintenance payable under a stage 1 court order or court registered agreement in two circumstances:</PARA>
<PARA>.firstly, when a non-custodial parent's income from all sources is not more than the maximum rate of single pension and they are in receipt of an income tested pension, benefit or allowance&mdash;in practice this will usually be when the non-custodial parent is unemployed or unable to be employed through, for example, a serious illness; and</PARA>
<PARA>.secondly, when a child has left the ongoing care of the custodial parent. </PARA>
<PARA>In the case of a non-custodial parent's income falling below the threshold amount, he or she may apply to the registrar to not enforce the terms of a court order or court registered agreement. Checks will be undertaken with the Department of Social Security to ensure the non-custodian's income is below this threshold and, if verified, the amounts specified in the order will no longer be collected by the Child Support Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The non-enforcement period will generally be from the date of the non-custodian's application although the registrar will have a discretion to back-date the start of this non-enforcement period to the date the person first qualified under this income test. However, the non-enforcement period will not commence earlier than the day on which child support was last collected. This will prevent overpayments of child support being made to custodial parents and the subsequent hardship to children and custodial parents that could occur through recovery of this overpayment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, if a child leaves the ongoing care of a person named in a stage 1 court order or court registered agreement, the registrar will, where both parents elect, no longer enforce the terms of the order or agreement as they apply to that child. Temporary absences, including normal access time and temporary short-term changes to access arrangements, will be ignored. Further, a child at boarding school will not be deemed to have left the care of the custodial parent. It is not the intention of this amendment to allow non-custodial parents to obtain credits against their liability for each and every day they care for their children. The parents must agree in writing that a substantive change in care has occurred and that it is likely to be ongoing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that the court order or court registered agreement will not be changed as a result of this amendment. This amendment merely gives the registrar the ability to not enforce certain amounts for the periods involved. No debt accrues to the Commonwealth during these periods. It will always remain open to either party to have the order varied or for the custodial parent to enforce amounts in his or her own right. This amendment simply gives the registrar the ability to not enforce a registered liability for the period involved. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">4. Private collection</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill extends the rights of custodial parents in receipt of an income tested pension, benefit or allowance to collect child support privately. Newly registered clients receiving an income tested pension, benefit or allowance may, under the current law, elect, at the outset, to receive child support payments privately. Large numbers make that election and the agency becomes involved in collection for these clients only when private arrangements fail. However, once the agency does become involved in collection for these clients, they are not able to subsequently elect for private collection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment will introduce greater freedom for parents to make private arrangements for payment. The choice will be available to custodial parents where the non-custodial parent has a good payment record; that is, when there are no arrears outstanding at the date of election and all payments have been made on time for the six-month period before the election. If a private arrangement fails, the custodial parent will be able to elect, once again, to have the liability enforced by the Child Support Agency. The registrar will be able to collect three months of arrears upon application for CSA enforcement. In exceptional circumstances, the registrar will be able to collect up to nine months of arrears. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears almost certain that this bill will not be debated by the Senate this year. As a result, the government wishes to introduce an amendment, the effect of which is to delay the commencement of these provisions from 1 January 1995 to the date of royal assent. The government also wishes to introduce another minor amendment to the provisions that I have just outlined for the collection of arrears in certain circumstances. It ensures that where an application for arrears is for a period of up to nine months but there are no exceptional circumstances, any arrears outstanding for the period of the most recent three months will be registered for collection without the need for a payee to lodge another application for the shorter period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum which has been circulated contains a more detailed explanation of the provisions of the bill. I also table the amendment together with a supplementary explanatory memorandum explaining the amendments. I commend the bill, as amended, to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. After the report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, I hope that next year the minister and I will be facing off across the table debating quite a few more child support amendment bills&mdash;that is, of course, if he is actually still the minister. It is impossible to approach this debate with anything other than mixed feelings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill will provide some relief to some clients of the Child Support Agency, which is why the coalition is not opposing the legislation. But, at the same time, we are all aware that many others will continue to suffer under an uncaring, inefficient and inflexible agency&mdash;an agency that has had its faults made very clear this week. That is why we are proposing an amendment to the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's bill implements the legislative requirements of the reforms to the Child Support Agency, announced in April by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear). Bandaid measures is a good old cliche of Australian politics. This bill is casualty war treatment. Now that the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues has given us a full diagnosis of the CSA's problems, we look forward to seeing the legislation that will really reform the Child Support Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is rather convenient for the Assistant Treasurer to have a bill like this around at the moment. I suspect the Assistant Treasurer imagines he will be able to counter criticism in the report by pointing to this bill and the changes he has already announced. You can almost imagine the press release his staff have already drafted: `Reform already under way, minister responds'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose it is an argument but, when we look at the enormous problems the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues identified, it is hardly convincing. It is even less convincing when we look at the way the Assistant Treasurer and the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) have treated the report. The ministers have savaged its findings to such an extent that the member for Chifley (Mr Price) has had to take the extraordinary step of issuing a media release saying that he is happy to debate the report and its recommendations with the ministers at any time and any place. If we can take today's bill as an indication of support for reform of the CSA, there is little evidence that much more will be coming from the Assistant Treasurer or the Minister for Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Chifley has already been forced to make a personal explanation in the House defending his committee's report against criticism from the ministers in his own party. Yesterday's release from the member for Chifley shows the fight is growing. Not only have the relations between the ministers and the member for Chifley completely broken down but also it appears that the ministers have decided to protect their reputations and their departments by scorning the wholesale changes recommended in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A record number of people made submissions to the CSA inquiry. The government must not ignore them, especially as many of the comments and recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues are particularly relevant to today's debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has told us that different CSA officers have used different administrative procedures. It has found that some CSA administrative practices actually conflict with the child support legislation. CSA review procedures have been strongly condemned. It has been suggested that, as review officers are not accountable to the Child Support Registrar, there is a lack of consistency in decision making. As decisions are not published, there is no precedent to follow. So parties do not have the ability to predict what may happen in their situation, causing uncertainty and a lack of confidence in the review system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was scathing of many of the CSA's administrative procedures, claiming it was unacceptable that the CSA had not been able to rectify the inadequacies of its service delivery. It pointed out that CSA staff had regularly been rude to clients; been unhelpful or biased; made personal judgments about clients and their circumstances; refused to give reasons for decisions; told clients anything to get them off the phone; and made entirely inappropriate remarks such as, `You'd be better off on the dole.'</PARA>

It has been claimed that CSA staff have interpreted court orders incorrectly and have incorrectly registered applications to courts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation proposes changes that will give CSA staff greater discretionary powers. In the past, the high number of complaints to the ombudsman and findings like those published a few months ago by the Auditor-General have suggested that agency staff do not necessarily have the skills to make the sensitive and responsible decisions their work entails. The government must make sure that CSA officers are up to the job if this legislation is to deliver any of the desired results. The government must make sure that staff have the comprehensive training they need to effectively manage the issues this legislation raises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first part of the bill deals with presumption of parentage. Under the current legislation, the registrar is able to accept that a particular man is the father of a child only under certain provisions. The bill will extend the current provisions to include those that exist in the Family Law Act 1975, making it easier for mothers to provide proof of parentage. This is expected to result in faster approval of applications for child support and earlier commencement dates. I need not say how desirable this would be when we consider that the certain family law issues committee found that, rather than taking the targeted eight weeks, it took an average of more than 20 weeks for custodians to receive the first payment. This is also likely to benefit the non-custodial parent, who will be less likely to receive a large arrears bill consisting of back payments from the date of application when child support commences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, now that there is an avenue for presumption of parenthood which is independent of the father, there is also a possibility that disputes may arise when the registrar&mdash;in other words, agency staff&mdash;will be required to make a decision on which case will be upheld. Review of these will be available only through the Family Court. Given the stress and anxiety parents and children could suffer over these decisions if they are forced to contest them in court, I sincerely hope the CSA will be able to handle these matters adequately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second proposed change aims to close a loophole that has allowed some parents to abuse the welfare system. As the child support legislation has no jurisdiction over private agreements, parents with registered agreements where the custodial parent has received a minimal amount of child support are picking up the balance of their income from social security. The Social Security Act 1991 already gives the DSS power to refuse sole parent benefits if it believes custodial parents have not made reasonable efforts to receive maintenance. The new rules will require that custodial parents who receive the sole parent pension or family payments take reasonable action to ensure that they are receiving adequate maintenance and provide the mechanism whereby the CSA and DSS can determine this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Custodial parents refused applications under these regulations will be able to appeal against a decision by Social Security through the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and the AAT. A decision by the CSA may be appealed only through the Family Court. Again, while supporting this measure, the coalition is concerned about the CSA's ability to fulfil its administrative responsibilities. I have already mentioned the difficulties and strain involved in appealing to the Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third part of the bill tackles some of the inflexible regulations that stage 1 parents endure when they try to alter their support agreement through the Family Court. Up until now, the CSA has been required to strictly follow court orders, even when clients' circumstances change. This legislation will allow the CSA a degree of discretion in enforcing court orders when the non-custodial parent's income falls below a certain threshold or if a child leaves the care of a custodial parent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the first case, payers will be able to apply for a temporary waiver and, in the latter, both parents will need to make an agreement and either party may resolve to continue to have payments enforced at a later date. Court orders will remain unchanged and parents will need to apply to the courts if they wish to make an alteration to the agreement itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to raise two concerns about these provisions. As I said earlier, the CSA has a poor administrative record. Many parents are understandably wary of its activities and of decisions made by its staff. We have already heard this week how the CSA has refused to give reasons for decisions and has failed to provide clients with adequate information on their rights and obligations. If the agency fails to ensure that its clients are aware of these new freedoms, parents will not use them, defeating the purpose of this legislation. At the same time, the CSA will need to be vigilant and ensure that payers who apply for waivers do not surreptitiously recommence without their knowledge. Given the agency's poor record of enforcement, there is a clear need to make sure this does not occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final change proposed today is an amendment to the Child Support Act that will allow Social Security clients the option of receiving payments either through the CSA or privately. Under the current legislation payees who have chosen to be paid through the CSA cannot have a private agreement. The bill will allow parents to have private agreements where payments have been regular, along with the right to return to agency collection if payments become irregular, offering clients greater flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later in this debate I will be moving an amendment to this bill condemning the government for its handling of the CSA. The demands for services we put on our governments and the standards of financial and administrative accountability we require of them makes bureaucracy a necessity in our society. But this bureaucracy must work. It must remember that it exists to serve its clients only. In a democracy, when a bureaucracy that has been put in place to meet the demands of a section of the community, which have been considered worthy of attention and support by the government, does not work, the ethos of that democracy is undermined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CSA must be responsive to clients and accountable to the parliament. My office is handling one particularly egregious case which provides the perfect illustration of how the CSA actually works. The minister might like to hear how the CSA appears to be supporting contempt of court. An individual awarded custody of two children by an order of the Family Court has had one child illegally removed by the ex-spouse. The Child Support Agency is now determining whether the child support paid to that first individual should now be reduced. The CSA reasons that that first individual now does not have the responsibility for the daily care of the child. The most bungling of old Eastern bloc officials at their most bitingly satirist could not have produced such a scenario. It is a disgrace that such a situation should exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the CSA was founded, the government has shown a complete lack of sensitivity to the problem it tries to alleviate. Parental separation is one of the most distressing and stressful experiences. It might be thought that special consideration to this point might be paid as a matter of course. The opposite has happened. The Child Support Agency is one of the most unprofessional sectors of government. When the ombudsman handed down his annual report a few weeks ago I pointed out that the CSA, with 300,000 active cases, had generated 2,451 complaints. Social Security, with five million clients, only generated less than a thousand more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a long time the government has claimed that the only people complaining about the CSA was a well-organised minority of non-custodial parents. The sorts of complaints and concerns raised about the CSA should have disproved this myth long ago. The child support formula is a cause for concern and should be examined, but there is a huge variety of other problems raised about the CSA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give just one example of the sorts of complexities we are dealing with. The committee found that a child support determination event occurs if a liable parent ceases to be a resident of Australia and it recommended that the registrar be empowered to obtain a court order stopping a liable parent from leaving Australia until appropriate arrangements had been made for the payment of child support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what action could the government take or would it take in the case of non-custodial parents who are posted overseas by their employers not by their choice? The CSA's review system leaves much to be desired. Social Security and DEET have a four-step appeal mode where the client can appeal to the original decision maker, to the local manager, to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal or the Student Assistance Review Tribunal and, finally, to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Child Support Agency clients can only appeal to an authorised review officer of the CSA and then to the Family Court, or, in the case of stage 1 parents, to the Family Court in the first instance. The cost of court action is an obvious barrier to many people seeking to have a review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues set up a hotline, which attracted 150,000 calls, the myth I spoke of earlier was put to rest. The committee's report has totally exposed the CSA. It should be a matter of shame for the Assistant Treasurer that he and the Minister for Social Security are now punishing the member for Chifley for telling the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's report should not have been news. The CSA has been under fire for many years. Criticisms have come from the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the Auditor-General, the parliament and the many support groups that exist to help clients who have been poorly treated by the agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government likes to claim that it is responsible for spreading the notion of child support and responsibility for children. This is not the case. All reasonable Australians accept the idea of child support. What they do not accept is poor and insensitive administration. This is what the CSA has offered to too many of its clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reforms we are debating today should have been already introduced. All the ministerial spin doctoring cannot overrule the fact that the most controversial elements of the scheme throughout its history&mdash;the formula and tougher measures for enforcing payments&mdash;have not been dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems of the CSA will not go away. They cannot be obscured. This week has made this clear. It is also clear that these faults have been obvious for some time. The government should be condemned for not tackling them earlier. For that  reason, I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The welfare of children is a topic that I do not think anyone would disagree is extremely important. This government is well aware that the welfare of children is a very important issue, because it brought in the child support system, it has advanced the number of child-care centres which have been developed in this country, it has introduced fee relief and it has introduced the child-care cash rebate. It has also entered into a great number of packages for families&mdash;more recently the home child-care allowance and, shortly, the parenting allowance. I think that any condemnation from the opposition about this government's commitment to child care and child welfare is ill founded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will come later to the issue of the administration of the Child Support Agency, but the child support scheme was brought in for some very good reasons. Those of us who remember the old days of guilt in divorce&mdash;when a couple divorced there had to be a guilty party and we saw the ludicrous situation of people being set up or deliberately setting themselves up in order to provide a case for a divorce&mdash;will remember that children were seen either as a prize or as something to be taken away from parents as a punishment for their part in a divorce. I am very pleased that family law legislation&mdash;more recently the Family Law Reform Bill&mdash;has gone a long way to changing this system. I think it is that whole issue of custody and access and of payment of child support that has given rise to so many of the problems that so many of us as local members encounter every day in our electorate offices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had a letter only the other day from a man who was extremely bitter. He was venting his spleen against women parliamentarians. He saw us as a bunch of nasty little feminists who had messed up his life by bringing in the child support system and no guilt in divorce. I wrote back and said, `I am sure that my sisters here would be flattered to think we had so much power because we are in such a small minority.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was triggered into writing this letter after I sent out my regular newsletter and talked about the affirmative action plans in the Australian Labor Party. He condemned me for supporting that because it would mean more nasty feminists coming into this place and doing more to mess up his life. Initially, I felt angry and then a great deal of sympathy because I realised that he was reacting to the situation in his life. He told me that his wife had walked out on him. He felt that she was the guilty party and ought to have been punished as far as the divorce was concerned. He thought she should not have been given custody of the children because she was the guilty party. We need to change those attitudes, and they will not change just by changes in legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some honourable members may remember the speech I gave in this place a while ago about Shere Hite's report on the family. I discussed how the family is evolving, how we are gradually moving away from the patriarchal family where the father is the boss, where the boys grow up to be tough and the girls grow up to be homemakers. I think part of that whole psychological framework of our society has given rise to situations that end up in some nasty divorces and battles over children, including the whole issue of custody and access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Family Law Reform Bill is taking away the terms `custody' and `access'. We are now looking at parenting agreements. I think parents should accept responsibility for their children regardless of where they are living and whether it is temporary or permanent. Both parents have a responsibility to look after and care for their children. I know that all members in this place have had a number of constituents come to see them complaining about the Child Support Agency. Some of those complaints are justified, and some of them are not justified. Amongst the not justified complaints are those where non-custodial parents say, `I don't have custody of the children. I don't get access to the children because my spouse won't let me, even though the court has given me access. Therefore, why should I pay child support?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel very sad that they do not have access, but access is a totally different issue from child support. With this reform bill, I hope we will now be able to address the issue of access. Payment should not be conditional on access. The children still have to eat, be clothed and go to school whether or not they are seeing one parent, two parents or neither. They still have need to be cared for. Therefore, child payment is justified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The issue of having child support taken out of the pay of non-custodial parents at source is also said to be humiliating. I agree that it probably can be quite humiliating, but they are generally cases where it has not been agreed by both sides that a private arrangement should be made. Let us face it: we brought in the child support system because so many non-custodial parents were getting away with not paying for their children. It is all very well for the Family Court to say, `This parent will have custody. This parent will pay X amount,' but in some cases that is not happening. The burden was then falling on the social security system, on the government and on you and me as taxpayers. Therefore, the child support system was brought in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) had quite a bit to say about the administration of the Child Support Agency. I think anyone who disagreed with its past record has probably been living on the moon for a length of time. The administration certainly has been very difficult and deficient, but I do not agree with his ongoing criticisms. The report brought down by the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) and tabled in this place the other day will go a long way towards fixing that. The minister responsible had already taken moves to fix a lot of the problems. The kinds of problems that have been brought to my attention are long delays in getting phones answered and getting responses back, getting a letter one day saying a person is in arrears and another the next day to say that he is in credit. I think they have been quite unjustified. I am sure every local member worth his salt in this place has done much to help those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had one case involving a non-custodial parent, the father, who had since remarried. His former wife decided to return to the UK and take the children with her. The judge in the Family Court agreed that was possible. The judgment was that his child support payments would be reduced by the equivalent of the cost of economy return air fares for the children to visit him in Australia or for him to visit them in the UK. He worked out that this would totally wipe out his child support payment. The Child Support Agency said, `We can't do anything about a court order. Why don't you claim the money back afterwards?' He said, `What hope have I got of claiming it back from the UK when it has already been spent?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He and his new wife came to me out of frustration. I am not blowing my own trumpet here, but what I am about to say shows that it has to take local members to get these things fixed. The man's new wife said that she went to the agency and said, `I am going to my local member about this.' The woman at the agency asked her, `Is that Maggie?' She said `Yes' and the woman said, `Oh God.' So I apparently have something of a reputation for kicking heads in the Child Support Agency. I am pleased to say that within a week that situation was fixed. The court order was honoured and the man was able to resume his life, even though he obviously missed his children, who were then taken out of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think it would serve a great purpose to catalogue the number of complaints that we have received, because we have all received a great number of them. I do not think we should be clouded by the dispute about some of the statistics in the member for Chifley's report. The issue is that there has been a problem, and that problem will now be fixed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the member for Chifley and the members of his committee on that report; it was a true example of consultative planning, consultative government. Too often in this place, because we sit in here as elected members, we think that we have the right to go ahead with what we think is right, and we do not often enough go out and consult those that we represent. I have the statistics here somewhere; I know there were thousands of phone calls on an open line over only a couple of days. The complaints ranged wide ly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were many complaints from men who felt that they were paying too much&mdash;and we have all had those complaints. There were the ones, as I described earlier, who thought they ought not to be paying at all because they did not get access to their children. Women complained that their former husbands were misrepresenting their income in order that the amount they paid was less than what they should have paid. There were a huge number of complaints and a huge number of written submissions, and I know that a good number of those came from my electorate. The member for Chifley's committee has achieved something that will be very much welcomed by a lot of people out there in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is fairly straightforward. It aims to provide more flexibility in the child support system. One way it does that is by aligning the child support presumptions of parentage with those in the Family Law Act. It is ridiculous to have one system for one act and a different one for another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parentage assumptions have been a lot tighter with the Child Support Agency. Some custodial parents&mdash;women&mdash;have even had to wait until DNA tests have been done in order to prove parentage. This can take an awful long time. It can tie up courts and a whole lot of bureaucracies while waiting to find out whether or not a particular person is the parent. So that is one measure that will go a long way in helping us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill introduces a measure whereby the social security system will now be able to make sure that those who are entering into private payments will not be paid at less than the formula assessment. Social Security will not simply be making up the deficit in cases where the formula is not being met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate that the welfare of children is paramount in this legislation. The assurance that both parents take full responsibility for looking after children, whether it is for their health, their welfare or their education is extremely important.

The achievement of this government on the employment front is quite remarkable: 434,000 jobs have been created since we were re-elected, that is, 87 per cent of the target, 87 per cent of our commitment, in only 20 months. One year ago the seasonally adjusted rate of unemployment was 11 per cent. Today it is 9.3 per cent. But if we go to the trend figures&mdash;because these are the important ones; they show the consistency&mdash;we can see a fall in the trend rate of unemployment every month for the last 15 months. It now stands at 9.2 per cent. Two out of three of the jobs created in the last 12 months have been full-time jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that, at 9.3 per cent, the unemployment rate is still too high, but what has to be acknowledged is the important progress we have made. We made a commitment as a government to get unemployment down. We did not say we would do it overnight but that we would make a real effort to get it down. These figures demonstrate that we are making remarkable progress to date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason the unemployment rate went up this month, despite that increase in jobs, was that it was influenced by the participation rate, which went up 0.3 per cent. This reflects a healthy labour market. It reflects the fact that at the same time as demand for labour is increasing so is the supply. It shows the flexibility and mobility in our labour force and it also, I might add, helps in ensuring that with the growth we can help contain the wage pressures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just the participation rate that this economy has had to deal with over the last decade. Our population growth has been second only to Turkey in growth amongst the OECD countries. It has been twice the OECD average. So, if we take the combination of the population growth, the participation growth and increases in the labour force, we have to create more jobs than other countries to get the unemployment rate down. In the period between 1983 and 1991 Australia has been growing jobs faster than any other OECD country and it is still producing them at three times the OECD average. The figures to date are confirmation of the trend.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying, the tariff reduction program, which started in 1988 and was reinforced in 1991, reduces tariffs generally to five per cent by 1996-97, and there is a more graduated program for cars, textiles, clothing and footwear to the year 2000. This year the tax cut, compared with keeping tariffs where they would otherwise have been had there not been this program, represents a cut in revenue of $3.7 billion, or a 3 1/2 per cent cut in tax. That is what the tax cut represents this year. By 1996-97, this per annum tax cut will have increased to $6 billion. So it is obviously a very substantial factor in terms of taxes being paid by the Australian people. The cumulative cost to revenue since 1988 will be around $17 billion by 1996-97.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this tariff reduction program represents a substantial ongoing program of increasing tax cuts which flows through to taxpayers in the form of cheaper clothing, cheaper cars, cheaper consumer durables and so on. It also reduces the cost of many inputs to industry. It is not just reduced prices for imports which are important for Australians; this has the double banger effect of forcing Australian produced goods to have lower prices than would otherwise be the case. So we see those prices also being lower. That gives the consumers a very substantial benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A good example of that is in the textiles, clothing and footwear industry. The price of TCF products has increased by five per cent less than the CPI over the five years of the tariff reduction program up to 1992-93. Since this program began, the average nominal rate of tariff on manufacturing has fallen from 9.5 per cent to 5.4 per cent this year. But the manufacturing industry as a whole has not been adversely affected; indeed, it is growing quite strongly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last 12 months to the September quarter, we saw manufacturing production increase by 12.2 per cent, which is clearly very strong growth. Manufacturing exports, in terms of volume, have increased 2 1/2 times since the mid-1980s and manufacturing confidence is close to the highest levels in 30 years. Clearly, this tariff reduction program has not had a damaging effect on our manufacturing industries; rather it has galvanised them into vastly improved performance and has been of great benefit to all of the Australian people through lower prices and a much more vibrant sector of the economy which is also producing considerable exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission has estimated that the 1991 reforms which extended the tariff reform process would reduce the underlying inflation by just under two per cent and increase the GDP growth by 0.4 per cent. Clearly, this whole program is very beneficial to the Australian people. It is an ongoing program of very substantial tax cuts which should not be overlooked. It is producing lower prices for consumer goods, reducing the rate of inflation, producing a more dynamic manufacturing industry with much improved export capability and giving us higher growth. That is being evidenced in the very high rates of growth of GDP we are now experiencing.</PARA>

They were fully consulted in the preparation of the report, as were the leaders of parties at the federal level.

They have all done us a very great service. It is a very readable report; it is an exceptionally good one. The fact that such a body of educationalists has suggested that we rank civics education along with mathematics and English demonstrates their underlying concern and the priority they put upon the nature of this education.

That is now reduced to 90,000 and, as a result of today's measures, that will be reduced substantially again as aircraft get greater height, as we oblige them to take off from the end of the seaward runway and as we reduce the spread between the routes they might take.</PARA>

If it is true that your government remains committed to working men and women why, at a time when profits are at record levels, do you refuse to accept the reasonable wage claims of the Transport Workers Union? Why do you allow the Minister for Industrial Relations to sool employers onto the unions when the ACTU condemns him for it? Is the real truth that, as the former Treasurer, John Dawkins, claimed in July this year, it is the Business Council of Australia and not the unions that is the dominant influence on the Labor Party?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rarely go to Business Council functions. I made that clear the other day. Maybe the honourable gentleman was not listening when the Treasurer gave his answer earlier. We have had a four per cent increase in real incomes per capita in the last 12 months. That is what he said&mdash;a four percentage point increase in real incomes per capita in the last 12 months. Try to find any other Western society that has had a four per cent real increase in incomes per capita over the last 12 months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do you know why we have had that increase? It is because as nominal wages have risen with productivity and inflation has declined, the real income of Australians has risen. That is the lesson for anybody who was around in the 1980s and 1970s and who knows that high inflation robbed Australian families and Australian workers of their savings and their purchasing power and put big mortgages on them. The economic management of the government, which has taken average inflation rates from 10 per cent under the hopeless, feckless, incompetent opposition we now have&mdash;the then government&mdash;to an inflation rate of under two per cent, is why real incomes are rising. It is not only real incomes that are rising; employment is also rising. So there is a rise not only in incomes per capita but also in the number of people in households in work. Household disposable income, as distinct from per capita income, is rising sharply as a consequence. That is because of the maintenance of the government's anti-inflationary policies, inflationary performance, and the productivity arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer to the honourable member is that there are short-term gains for people thinking en masse. They can go out and secure high nominal wage increases to find them taken away a month later by higher inflation. That is why the government has been urging responsible outcomes. But we are certainly not urging&mdash;I share this view with the honourable member&mdash;a higher level of profit share in the economy, which is already beyond any historical precedent. Why would we? If profits go higher than where they are now they will be claimed back by the work force. And of course they should be, because there is just no case for a profit share way beyond any level in our historical experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So now as we see greater volumes occurring in the recovery on top of the profits which already exist, the profit share is bound to rise. That will be shared under enterprise bargaining with workers through higher real wages. But that will come by way of productivity. It will be enhanced by the greater level of plant and equipment investment, because we are talking here about factor productivity&mdash;not labour productivity&mdash;which is coming from plant, equipment and labour productivity. With a 29 per cent increase in plant and equipment investment coming through this last 12 months we are going to see a greater rise in productivity, and the workers are entitled to share in it. If they are not entitled to get a wage increase now, when are they entitled to get a wage increase?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about a wage increase the economy can afford, whereas the other side of the House wants to drive young people down to $3 an hour, rip away at people on incomes under $20,000 and build a profit share. Why ordinary coves like the member for Bennelong, who came not from the landed gentry&mdash;he was not born with a cutlery service in his mouth&mdash;would be out there urging that we rip the guts out of low income workers' incomes at the height of these sorts of profits is beyond me. That sort of spite is completely beyond me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is not the position of the questioner; he does not hold that position. But he must understand that, were we to go back to high levels of inflation, Australian workers would be the first to suffer because the people who have paid most the price of high inflation in Australia in the last 20 years have been the work force of this country. That is why the ACTU and the leadership of the ACTU have had such an anti-inflationary cast to their policy.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have today allocated the two-channel satellite pay TV licence, commonly known as licence C, to a subsidiary of the ABC. This allocation fulfils the government's commitment to allow the ABC to participate in pay TV on the basis that it is a sensible commercial arrangement and one that has a structure that minimises any detriment to the ABC's free-to-air services. The government has provided a start-up grant of $12.5 million to meet the initial capital costs of the ABC being involved in pay TV. The ABC has advised me that it plans to launch the service in the early part of next year. The ABC has also told me that it plans to have one channel devoted to news, continuing the ABC's provision of high quality news and current affairs, and a second channel which will provide a mixture of children's, drama and other programs, such as the arts and light entertainment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In consultation with the ABC I have put a licence condition on the licence granted to the ABC's subsidiary.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The view the government has put forward that the ABC has the right to explore its opportunities in pay TV can be contrasted with the many views that have been expressed by the opposition over the last few years. Changing and multifaceted views of the opposition are not just restricted to the third runway in Sydney. At one stage we had the opposition spokesman demand that the ABC be given a licence.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition certainly is into flexibility, as the Assistant Treasurer says. There has been some media coverage today of a report which the Australian Broadcasting Authority released yesterday, which followed some extensive research undertaken by the ABA on the views and attitudes of the Australian community on whether R-rated material should be available on pay TV. There was one unfortunate headline&mdash;put on by one of the subeditors, no doubt&mdash;in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> that disturbed me. It ran the report under the headline `Pay TV porn plan backed'. The government has made it very clear all along that it will not allow under any circumstances X-rated programs on pay television. I am sure that is the strong view of people on both sides of the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">R-rated programs will be available only if parliament agrees, and that will only happen if there are resolutions carried by both houses. Even if parliament does approve of R-rated material being on pay TV, the legislation requires that that material be able to be restricted by parents by the use of PIN numbers or smart cards. The ABA's research has shown that most parents indicate that they will be likely to use such devices to ensure that they can protect their children. These important safeguards go to an important object of the Broadcasting Services Act&mdash;to ensure that the community places a high priority on the protection of children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I expect the parliament will have a chance to debate this issue in both houses once we have had a chance to read the ABA's report and once we have had a chance to see the Senate select committee's report on community standards when it becomes available.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! Yesterday the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) raised as a possible question of privilege the availability of bills presented by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous). The honourable member stated that the bills had not been made available to members of the opposition but, the honourable member claimed, earlier in the day they had been made available to members of the press, or the media. The honourable member said that she had attended a briefing earlier in the day but had not been given copies of the bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no involvement in the processes engaged in by ministers in respect of legislation before its introduction. It may be that, on occasions, copies of draft or settled bills are provided to shadow ministers before the bills are presented to the House. The extent and nature of any consultation or briefing engaged in by ministers in respect of bills is a matter for the judgment of each minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my opinion, there has been no prima facie evidence that an issue of privilege or contempt is involved in the points made by the honourable member for Mackellar yesterday. These matters are rather matters of practice and arrangements in respect of legislation. If the facts are as alleged there may have been some discourtesy, but that is another matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I seek clarification. The fact of the matter is that the legislation was made available by the minister's office to the press gallery. When I specifically asked for the legislation at the briefing, I was told it would not be made available to anyone under any circumstances prior to the tabling of those bills in the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it a question of contempt? Is there a convention here that in fact legislation ought not to be made available prior to it being tabled as reports of committees are? I think it is a very serious point because it is more than discourtesy. It is far more than discourtesy; it is a matter of proper respect being paid to the parliament, as distinct from the distinction that was made that it was somehow more important to give legislation to the press gallery rather than to the parliament. It was not a question of members of the opposition; it was of any member of parliament. </PARA>

Certainly, on what I have ascertained by looking at past practice, there is no prima facie case which would want me to seek any suggestion of privilege being breached or whatever.

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government welcomed the tabling in November 1988 of the Committee's Report.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Committee noted on page 25 of its report, the then Australian Audit Office (AAO) found that the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) had already taken action on the key matters of concern to the AAO by the time the Efficiency Audit commenced.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is pleased that the Committee was able to agree with the complimentary assessment by the AAO and also that the considerable efforts made by the ATO to improve its performance were recognised.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees with all of the observations  made by the Committee in its report. In particular, the Committee's clear endorsement of the benefits of a high integrity taxpayer identification system was welcomed. The passage of the Tax File Number (TFN) legislation enabled the ATO to more effectively identify tax evaders&mdash;a matter which received particular attention by the AAO in this Efficiency Audit.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The TFN legislation has fostered a climate more conducive to voluntary compliance with the tax laws. In addition, the ATO's Modernisation program is enabling more efficient and effective identification and actioning of non compliance.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also noted the importance of developing more effective case selection techniques and the value of systematically targeting particular industries for audits. Bearing in mind the need to make more effective use of audit resources in the unincorporated and small business sectors, the ATO implemented an enhanced program of audit projects. The program focuses on non-compliance and its measurement in targeted industries and on specific issues and for particular types of income.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Committee suggested, these projects not only detect and measure non-compliance in a more systematic way but also foster voluntary compliance through publicity at appropriate stages and through working with appropriate industry associations.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee commented favourably on the high degree of co-operation evident between the AAO and ATO throughout the Efficiency Audit. The Committee can be assured that this co-operation has continued and will be a feature of future audits.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have now come to the end of the parliamentary year. This is the last opportunity for there to be a debate of this kind in this chamber in 1994. What we can say about this year is what we can say about so many years of a Labor government in power. It is a year of a government which has exercised power without values.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole theme of deceit and defrauding the Australian public is the theme that has run through everything this government has been doing in the course of this year. That is particularly true of the latter part of this year&mdash;the last month or so. There is no better example of that than the performance of the Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) and the way the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) insists on defending that man and refusing to do what he should obviously do and that is dismiss the minister for complete and utter incompetence. After all, the member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) was dismissed from her portfolio for misleading and defrauding Australian taxpayers in relation to the expenditure of some $30 million. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The sports rorts affair was small beer compared with the damage that has been caused by the Minister for Transport and Industrial Relations. When you look at the list of things he has done to Australians you find that it is a list of shame. He has created chaos in relation to aviation safety and there are something like six separate inquiries under way at the moment in that area. Yet for some reason or other the Prime Minister seems to think he is doing a good job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only is he the minister who is responsible for massive increases in aircraft noise over Sydney but also he is the man who on 28 July signed off a minute saying that he knew where the increases in noise would be and where the flight paths would be and then later went and told the Marrickville Council a completely different story. In other words, he totally misled and, I believe, deliberately misled the people of Sydney about the impact of the third runway and it is he and the Prime Minister who are responsible above all for the pain that is being felt by the people of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increases in delays at Sydney airport and the enormous inefficiencies surrounding that airport have become a matter of international embarrassment to Australia. Again, it is the Minister for Transport who is responsible for the total incompetence surrounding the affairs at Sydney airport. Something like 91 per cent of all Ansett flights in and out of Sydney are delayed. Ansett Airlines has received something like 30,000 complaints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of industrial relations, we have seen backflips, reversals of policy, cave-ins to the trade union leadership and a change to the industrial relations legislation which has given the trade unions special privileges, even greater privileges than they had before, and they have taken advantage of that. They have taken advantage of that by now increasing very substantially the level of industrial disputation. As we move towards Christmas, Australians are going to suffer the consequences of changes in industrial relations legislation, done at the behest of the trade union movement, which will lead to substantial increases in industrial disputation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister is totally responsible&mdash;there is no way for him to scurry out of this&mdash;for the debacle surrounding the Australian National Line. He has simply lost tens of millions of taxpayers' dollars over the Australian National Line debacle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister insists that this is a minister who is doing a good job. He is doing a good job, yet all the evidence is indisputably there that this is a minister who has brought great damage to this country. How could it be? Is it just a coincidence that Mr Brereton just happens to be the minister in the portfolio which has seen a deterioration in aviation safety, a scandal surrounding Sydney airport, increases in industrial disputation and another scandal surrounding the Australian National Line? Is that bad luck? Is that just a coincidence? Do not be absurd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is patently obvious that the only reason this incompetent minister will not be sacked is that he is part of the Prime Minister's royal family. There is absolutely no dispute about that. The fact is that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport go back a long way&mdash;way back to the Blaxland pre-selection. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That murky night in 1969 when Laurie rushed off on his motor bike with a ballot box riding pillion. The fact is that he is being defended by the man who is now Prime Minister for favours given. This is just another illustration of the point that, throughout its life, this government has exercised power without values. Concepts of ministerial responsibility go out the window, they do not matter. The need to ensure the parliament is treated with proper respect, that standing orders are properly upheld and that fundamental institutions like question time are conducted with at least a modicum of dignity are out the window. The government does not want that any more, it does not suit the Labor Party. It does not matter what the consequences for public respect of this institution may be, that is the end of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes to integrity there is no person who has more to answer for than the Prime Minister of this country. We have this absolute debacle surrounding Sydney airport, and who was the real architect of the particular decision that was made back in 1989? The man who is responsible for all that is happening today at Sydney airport is the Prime Minister of this country. It was he who persuaded the cabinet to cast aside the proposals which, for example, the Fraser government had accepted to build a third runway but for the take-offs and landings to come from the south. The Prime Minister said, `No, it does not matter about the people, we will make sure that we maximise economic efficiency regardless of the social cost.' That was never going to matter, so there would be take-offs and landings over the northern suburbs of Sydney. The consequences of that are there for all to see. It was the Prime Minister who persuaded the cabinet to accept that particular proposal and it is he who is ultimately responsible for all that has happened at Sydney airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we have a new plan which was announced today. There was glittering publicity, press conferences were held and promises were made, but at the end of the day we will still find thousands upon thousands of people in Sydney who will have their lives disrupted, their lives destroyed in many respects, by the changes to the flight patterns brought about by the actions of the Prime Minister of this country. Never let that be forgotten. All this stuff about who favoured a third runway or who did not is not the point. The point is the flight paths the aircraft use. </PARA>

The fact is that you have made some changes today, but the people of Sydney will remain inconvenienced by the actions of the Prime Minister.

Of course it was abandoned. Then in the 1993 budget you said, `We might have that second tranche of tax cuts in 1998.'

When we said in 1993 that you were on a spending spree that would have made John Maynard Keynes spin in his grave, you went out and argued that the budgetary settings were perfect. In May 1994 you said that the fiscal settings were fine. You said that they were absolutely perfect. What are you saying now? You are saying now that they are wrong.

Next year you are increasing spending by another $7 billion, but you say, `It has to be done. We just have to remain on our spending spree. We can't afford to offend any of our special interest groups, the delicate coalition of interests that we have knitted together in the Labor Party. We cannot afford to do any of that.

Governing any country is a hard, tough business for people who have a bit of experience and can stay in the kitchen with the heat, but the opposition leader ain't one of those people.

Personally, I hope he sticks around and learns during the next few years in his leadership of the opposition.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Leader of the Opposition stood up and said at his first press conference, `I was born in the Liberal Party.' I am proud to say that I was born in Australia. By saying that he was born in the Liberal Party, as he did on that occasion, he defined himself as a person born in a party now without ideas and without an attitude as to how you govern a country&mdash;a bunch of meretricious players in these debates. Every single item that the opposition leader presented as a reason the Prime Minister, the government, and an individual minister ought to be censured is a position that the opposition at some point of time adopted and which it now wishes to walk back from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As somebody who has actually held the employment, education and training portfolio, I think one of the most extraordinary statements made by the opposition leader was an accusation that this government was not prepared to introduce cuts, was not prepared to take some degree of hard decision. Every single proposition for a saving that we put forward, and that I put forward when I was a minister in the Department of Employment, Education and Training&mdash;they have gone through the chamber at a very slow pace over the last couple of years&mdash;has been rejected by the opposition in the Senate where there is the capacity to stop the government spending and the capacity to stop the government cutting. Every single cut we have put forward was rejected. This deficit we now confront is $650 million higher as a result of those efforts, among others, than it might have been had the opposition not pursued those positions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those in the opposition always have a reason for why they ought not to vote for the propositions: it might be a bit inequitable here; it might cause a bit of hardship there; what about the rural sector somewhere else&mdash;whatever. What they do not seem to comprehend&mdash;I thought the Prime Minister spelt it out for them in question time in words of one syllable&mdash;is that you do not actually cut spending without cutting something that is going to somebody. It is not possible to do it any other way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite talk about values, but they stand up in this place and criticise the government on that front. Then, when they are asked a reasonable question by the press as to what they would do, they talk in generalities, not specifics, and claim that they will never have to arrive at specifics. They come to a million different conclusions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) accused the Prime Minister of course, getting to values, of being a liar when the Prime Minister had the temerity, in his view, to come into this place and say that he had called for an $11.7 billion cut in the deficit. That was a spectacular claim&mdash;there is no question about that&mdash;but it goes to how the opposition behaves itself in public. It talks about values, but it has a view for everybody in the public that asks them a question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those in the opposition operate out there in the public as though nobody runs media monitoring services, as though nothing actually gets back to government ministers about what they are saying. They run a million contradictory policies out there, misleading the public, and then get in here and give us a lecture on values. Here is what the Prime Minister was alleged to have lied about. I will go through every single word of the question and answer. The transcript states:</PARA>

<PARA>There were no lies from the Prime Minister. I would have thought anybody could comprehend what was stated by the opposition spokesperson. But what the opposition spokesperson wants to do is slip-slide out there for the Pru Goward show and have a bit of a word out there. He thinks, `There might be a few deficit daleks out there who want to hear from me.' When he rocks into this parliament and says something different, he thinks he is upholding values of high integrity. That is the Deputy Leader of the Opposi tion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know about the Leader of the Opposition when it comes to values. The very reason his leadership is in trouble after such a blinding start is precisely this: over those early months of leadership, there was a persistent pattern of discussion whereby he repeatedly contradicted himself in public and appeared to play to one audience as opposed to another. That is why he is in trouble. He is not in trouble because there is an insatiable desire out there to vote Labor. He is not in trouble because people do not like young people around the place as potential leaders. He is in trouble for one reason and one reason only: he destroyed his credibility in the first few months he was in office by the positions he put on values, oddly enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Politics is a tough game. Sometimes you have to change your opinions on things. There is no doubt about that. Sometimes you get better information, and you do your level best to explain yourself to the public. When you have a personal record like that of the opposition leader, you cannot rock into this place and make claims about your opponents that are really more applicable to yourself without suffering some embarrassment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition leader went on to talk about the runway. I feel a degree of sorrow for him here because he is speaking in ignorance, as opposed to being deliberately misleading. When the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and other people came out and spoke in favour of a third runway at Sydney airport in 1989 or 1990, they were not talking about Wal Fife's runway. They had the benefit of seeing environmental impact studies and the government's plans. They knew exactly what the government proposed for that third runway. It is no good claiming, as the Leader of the Opposition does, that somehow or other their claim in 1989 or 1990&mdash;remember that we are talking about integrity&mdash;was a suggestion to the government of the day to do their version of the runway, not its version of the runway. That is not what they said. They said, `Do your version of the runway, and do it real quick.' That was their position. He cannot come in here and claim, as he seems to do in his remarks, to uphold the highest values of integrity when what they were always arguing for was the proposition that they originally put. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Let me correct one other matter. The opposition leader made some assumptions, and again I think he was speaking in ignorance rather than being deliberately misleading. On the first point, he was being deliberately misleading. On this point, he is in ignorance. He said that the proposition they put forward would have runway take-offs and landings only to the south. That is a truly miraculous conclusion. The only reason planes take off to the north at all&mdash;remember that one of those runways has been there for yonks and is still operating&mdash;is because of Sydney's wind systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It happens to be, and still is the case, that the majority of take-offs occur to the south. Those that take off to the north run to only 20 or 30 per cent, but that is high. Here the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) has been unlucky with the gods, as opposed to planning, in that over the last few weeks he has confronted the time of the year when the wind system operates to produce the maximum take-offs to the north. But that is high. So the opposition leader came in full of integrity but was purely ignorant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition members came up with some absurd notion yesterday and came up with it again today. Do they think that Wal Fife, decent and great human being though he might have been, had such a connection with the maker that he could pray up a non-northerly wind direction for 100 per cent of the time? Do they really think Wal was capable of that? The maker, though I am sure he is both beloved of Wal and loves him dearly, will not deliver that outcome for him or anybody else in Sydney. If Wal was arguing that, he was deeply misled as to where he was going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we come to the position on the east-west runway. Opposition members can make an argument that they are a bit worried about safety issues. They can make an argument that they can run prop jets on half the runway. But what they then have to explain to the people of Sydney is that all that does is increase capacity on the main runways for heavy jets. That is the net effect. The Leader of the National Party, in the time convenient to present honest pictures about what was going on at Sydney airport, was able to say that the reason for doing that was to increase that capacity. He feels that it will help commuters in the country get into Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What opposition members cannot do, and what they are trying to do, is go out and tell the public that this would offer relief to people in the north. If anything, it will make life worse. There is no question about that. Make your point, but do not claim that it is achieving something else that it is not going to do. You have had a minister getting to grips with the environmental issues that have to be confronted by somebody who will keep those runways operating effectively. He cannot avoid it, nor escape it. By and large, the impact of that has been to dramatically reduce the number of people badly affected by aircraft noise in the Sydney area, and that ought to be welcomed by both government and opposition. By and large, the new routes and the measures that have been outlined by Minister Brereton will decrease significantly the impact of aircraft movement over the north of city, but it will not stop it. It never would have. No proposition could be put forward that would stop that. If you are going to put in the parallel runway, that is the inevitable conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) is delighted that the Prime Minister accurately quoted him today. The Prime Minister pointed out that, as far as the member was concerned, flights were welcome over his part of the city, that they would create no problems and therefore the government ought not stint on proceeding with the runway. What the opposition loves to do on the deficit, the runway and any other political leadership issue that comes up is to hide behind whatever the government is doing. No matter what their position is, no matter what their record is, members of the opposition want to criticise the government of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember their comments on the budget a year or so ago. They said that the government had grievously overestimated the amount of investment in the business community. They thought the government's views on the numbers by which unemployment would come down were hopelessly out of whack and that it would come down at a much slower rate. That is their record as predictors of where we were headed as far as this economy was concerned. They are neither priests nor, in this instance, prophets. They have been totally inaccurate on every prediction that they have put forward for the Australian economy. They have only one characteristic that we can commonly attribute to them: no matter what guise they might appear in, no matter what statements that they might pervade, they are gloom sayers and doomsayers. They do their level best to depress any opportunity. In that, they are an immature opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Prime Minister pointed out, there is a plethora of newspaper comment now on the opposition leader. If nothing else would convince you that the time has come, that performance by the Leader of the Opposition would do it now. `Time is up for Mr Downer,' said the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> this morning. `Downer is a dead duck,' said Laurie Oakes the other week. You will find a plethora of analysis of that around the place. As I said, I do not think there is any point in rolling him. The problem is not him; the problem is the lot of them. The problem is not curable, short of 10 years more of internal scouring to try to get together an attitude to this nation that makes them fit for government. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the House then chose to turn to the question of the Mascot runway. An option which has not been fully canvassed in the debate this week relates to limited operation on the east-west runway, east of the intersection, east of the crossover taxiway, which would provide a degree of relief. It is a falsehood for the minister who is just departing to argue that that is not the case. There is no doubt at all that shifting some of the aircraft take-offs to the eastern portion of the east-west runway will make more efficient the operation of the parallel north-south runways and, with that, ease the burden on the people of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Leader of the Opposition for clearly and surgically exposing this government's manifest incompetence and absolute hypocrisy. The case is absolutely clear at the end of this 1994 session of parliament: this government simply has to go. We have a Prime Minister who is an arrogant embarrassment to this nation, and a government of incompetent ministers who are simply not up to the mark. The chief culprit is, of course, the minister for disasters, the minister for screaming jets, the minister for scuttling the sale of national assets like ANL, the minister for Christmas strikes, the minister who must be sacked: Laurie Brereton&mdash;the minister for chaos. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to concentrate on the hypocrisy, arrogance and incredible double standards of this government, the Hades, if you like. I want to start matching the rhetoric with the outcomes, matching the words with the results. Firstly, there is the APEC agreement. It is well known that the federal coalition has consistently supported the APEC organisation and, indeed, much of it has flowed out of Bogor, but we have a more realistic approach to that which has flowed out of Bogor. It seems that the Prime Minister has caught the Bogor fever. I refer the House to Greg Sheridan, as I did the other day, and to other commentators in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister, after all the rhetoric, cannot even give us a clear statement as to whether the market liberalisation provisions of the Bogor declaration are ultimately discriminatory or non-discriminatory. He cannot yet even spell out where the ultimate objective with tariff reduction is to end. Is it to be zero per cent? Is he going to join the `Captain Zero Club', or is it to be zero to 5 per cent? Negligible is the more appropriate description and definition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Simply put, the rhetoric just does not match the outcome. The whole thrust of the Prime Minister's APEC rhetoric is about Australian exporters going gang busters in the APEC region. Do honourable members know what the outcome is? Despite all the wind from the Prime Minister, Australia is actually losing its market share in the APEC region. In 1985 Australian imports in the APEC region represented 4.09 per cent of the market. In 1992 that figure fell to 3.22 per cent and, in 1993, to 3.06 per cent. We face a falling market share in the APEC region. We face falling market share in many other regions of the world. That shows the real circumstance with regard to our trading performance. There is all this glorious rhetoric from the Prime Minister when in fact Australia is losing its market share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the Air New Zealand fiasco, we realise that the outcome is in total contradiction to the rhetoric. Here we have a Prime Minister sprouting on about free trade&mdash;after being a protectionist by degrees at the last election  and during the last sittings of parliament&mdash;whilst refusing, as he has now, Air New Zealand access to the Australian domestic aviation market for the most grubby and base of protectionist motives. And he did not even have the courage to take the matter to cabinet or caucus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in August 1992 the Australian and New Zealand transport ministers signed a memorandum of understanding which this government simply ignored this year; it completely reversed its position for no truly explicable reason. The result is that, despite all the rhetoric about APEC and a single aviation market between Australia and New Zealand, we have a government which has made a decision which is going to damage Australia's national interests, especially the interests of the tourism industry in south-east Queensland. It is ignoring the fact that Ansett and Qantas have been operating domestic services in New Zealand for a period of time. This really is a case where Australia should go back, do its homework and get it right. What is more chilling this particular day is to examine the ramification, the knock-on effect, of this Keating-Brereton decision against Air New Zealand and against Australia's national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) for bringing to my attention the plight of one particular company&mdash;Lyco. It is the sort of company that everyone on both sides of this parliament should be encouraging to get on with the job of exporting. I will tell honourable members what has happened to Lyco. Lyco's executive, Garry Lyons, says that Lyco exports hydraulic equipment to New Zealand, in accordance with the best of all we want to flow out of the CER agreement&mdash;some $1 1/2 million a year. Lyco has some four people pushing exports from Ballarat to New Zealand and trying to create a market in New Zealand against some pretty stiff competition from elsewhere in the Pacific Rim. Garry Lyons has said this day to my staff that Lyco's people in New Zealand are being shunned. Anti-Australian comment after comment is being made. People are not able to complete business deals in the circumstances. The ultimate comment&mdash;I quote exactly what they are being told&mdash;is this: `Hope we can trust you better than your government.' That is what the Kiwis are saying to the representatives of Lyco in New Zealand. They are saying, `Hope we can trust you&mdash;Lyco, Ballarat&mdash;generating exports to New Zealand, better than we can trust the Australian government.' If honourable members want to verify it with Garry Lyons, they can ring him on (053) 492 505. They will have absolute verification of that. This points to the sadness that Garry Lyons faces as he goes about generating exports from Australia to New Zealand and has the ground taken away from him by the actions of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what is happening in Thailand, an Australian market which I visited last week on the way back from the Middle East. I made a working visit to Israel; to the Gaza; to the Sinai, to see Australian troops; to Jordan; to Lebanon; and then I came back through Thailand. What did I find in Thailand? I found absolute agony over the remarks made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) and the follow-up remarks made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the follow-up remarks made by the Prime Minister with regard to the alleged conduct of the Thai army as it seeks to close off infiltration along the border between Thailand and Cambodia. We have yet another situation where the government's complacency and arrogance has made it so much harder for our exporters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of poverty is a real one. The gap between the rich and the poor is getting wider and wider. The Prime Minister talks about reaching back and picking up those who are not well off in the community. The words sound good; the outcome is different. The outcome is that 1.8 million Australians are living in poverty. The outcome is that, in the International Year of the Family, which is about to end and which has been hijacked by just about every minority group you can think of, almost 19 per cent of Australia's children aged under 15&mdash;about 704,000 children&mdash;live in a family with no breadwinner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a chilling circumstance. It is one which I think puts this Christmas into true and sad perspective and it is one which, after 11 or 12 years, this government has much to answer for. Throughout the whole of that decade-plus of the federal Labor government, the gap between rich and poor has got greater. That is why this government is a fraudulent government. This government cannot be trusted. This government is incompetent.

The real problem with ANL is not so much anything particular the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) has done; it is a fact that ANL has been allowed to die a slow, lingering near death over more than 30 years of conservative government stewardship with gross undercapitalisation and a failure to reassess necessary changes in direction. So, in 1983, this government inherited an organisation that had chronic problems. In spite of major capital injections, those problems continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has really hit home in the last couple of years have been changes in the world market for shipping. The break-up of the Soviet Union and changing economic policy in China have meant that the shipping services are being dumped like never before in an international market and we are suffering a glut. Those are the sorts of factors we need to debate in this House. Those are the sorts of issues of substance that need to be considered in a debate of this nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are clear signs of problems with the Civil Aviation Authority. The minister has done the right thing in instituting inquiries. The opposition wants to convict those involved, shoot them and then ask questions later. The government has bitten the bullet on the issue of the third runway&mdash;an issue that successive governments have failed to deal with. The government has bitten the bullet on the issue of air services to Sydney, unlike the Liberal Party when it was in government. Now that there are some consequential problems the government is seeking to address those problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not heard one item of detail from the opposition about how it would have addressed the difficulties&mdash;just a lot of abuse, a lot of epithets, a lot of phoney crocodile tears about its great concern for inner suburban working class residents and the problems they are suffering. It reminds me of what Jeff Kennett is doing. There is no such concern from the Liberal Party in Victoria for people in my electorate who are going to be victims of freeway extensions, who are going to have their health and the health of their children threatened by far greater emissions of particulates and other pollutants from vehicle emissions in their areas. So the opposition has one rule for when it is in here, one rule for when it is in opposition and one rule for when it is in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear about interest rates and taxes. Yes, there are macro-economic issues that the government has to face. Yes, there are some problems, problems that are partly as a result of the success that the government has had in getting growth going again. But it is a matter for legitimate debate in this place as to how these issues should be addressed, how the economic recovery should be calmed and should be sustained. Interest rates, though, are still relatively low compared with where they have been. Housing affordability is still at record levels and the deficit reduction strategy is ahead of schedule. If we believe the opposition on these issues, we would now be in the middle of a double-dip recession. Remember the double-dip recession? Unemployment would be higher. Long-term unemployment would not be dropping anywhere near as dramatically as it is. Business investment would not be up 22 per cent. Our deficit strategy would be in tatters. There would be lower taxes, higher spending and a lower deficit, magically. If the opposition has any credibility on these issues all we have to do is look back at what it has said and compare it with the record to get a sense of what has been going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought it was interesting today in the contribution of the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) in particular but also in that of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) that they felt obliged to raise things that occurred in 1968: the Blaxland preselection and things that occurred in 1985&mdash;namely, the tax summit. They were so light on for evidence and for examples about supposed failure of ministerial responsibility they had to go back that far to matters that had occurred when the people concerned, in one case, were not even ministers, not even members of this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we see, in effect, a theme of hypocrisy, a thread of hypocrisy, running all the way through the opposition's position. It is perhaps a little understandable from an opposition that is led by somebody who, in the previous leadership ballot prior to the one in which he was successful, managed to convince both camps that he had supported both of them. There is so little content in the matter of public importance put forward by the opposition today that we have to look at its credentials. Opposition members are coming in here lecturing us on leadership standards, on how ministers should behave. We perhaps should ask ourselves: are they leading by example? Can we perhaps look to the Leader of the Opposition for some shining inspiration about how leaders of governments should behave, about how leadership should be conducted?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at leadership of the opposition to see what example is being set for those of us who are in government and perhaps how the opposition would be in government. We would have one former leader drifting around the place asking people or having his stooges ask people, `How are you seeing things?' and saying, `Oh, no. I am not going to challenge. I believe in the Churchill definition of loyalty to the leader'&mdash;in other words, be loyal to them until there is a chance of knocking them off. `I will give loyalty to my leader in the same way that he gave loyalty to other leaders. I am not challenging for the leadership today. Not at this meeting.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had another former leader wandering around at private functions announcing that he was going to form a new party with 15 members. I think he got his estimate of the number of potential members a bit wrong&mdash;by about 14&mdash;but, still, it was pretty extraordinary stuff. Then we have the Senate leader seeking, quite legitimately, to come down to this place to follow in the footsteps of many other honourable members, such as the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) there, who cannot win preselection because his own leader's supporters, part of a factional brawl within the South Australian branch of the Liberal Party, cannot get it for him. And opposition members have the hide to sit over there and lecture us about the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) and preselection battles within the Queensland branch of our party! Yet we are sitting here at the moment when half of their members in the Western Australian branch are under threat of preselection defeat, including some in marginal seats. That is great leadership for you; that is real inspirational stuff! That is the sort of stuff that we over here should be taking some notice of&mdash;about how to run government, about ministerial standards and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then you have the great search across the length and breadth of the nation for the inspirational leader to come in here and save the day. So, even though opposition members have a leader and even though they are all desperately committed to him, people such as the federal President of the Liberal Party are out there talking to Robin Gray&mdash;Robin Gray, for God's sake&mdash;somebody who has been found by one of his own royal commissions to have acted dishonestly and deceitfully. He is seen as a possible Liberal saviour to come in here. Jeff Kennett, Nick Greiner, and so the list goes on. My near namesake Lindsay Thompson must be sitting back at home in Melbourne waiting for the call if this sort of stuff is any guide. Robin Gray&mdash;I ask you! Is it any wonder that we have been in office in this place for nearly 12 years?</PARA>

It shows that even big slabs of loyal Liberal voters think he is hopeless.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The report I have just presented follows the consideration by the committee of a complaint raised by the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter). On 8 June 1994, the honourable member complained about writs which had been served on a Mr Ayden Cross and a Mr R. Ellems. Mr R. Ellems was the signatory of a statutory declaration which had been provided to the honourable member for Kennedy and from which the honourable member had read in the course of a speech in the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Kennedy stated that the issuing of the writs in question constituted a prima facie case of contempt and that the action would interfere improperly with his ability to do his job. The Speaker allowed precedence to a motion which was agreed in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question of whether the serving of defamation writs on Mr Roland John Ellems and Mr Ayden Cross by Mr Peter Laurance amounts to improper interference in the honourable member for Kennedy's performance of his duties as a member of the House.</PARA>
<PARA>In the course of its inquiry, the committee received written communications from Mr Laurance and the honourable member for Kennedy. In addition, the honourable member for Kennedy appeared before the committee on 1 September. Having considered all the information available to it, the committee has concluded that no evidence has been produced to it which would establish that Mr Laurance's actions in initiating action against Messrs Cross and Ellems amounted to or were intended or likely to amount to improper interference in the free performance by the honourable member for Kennedy of his duties as a member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The actions of the honourable member for Kennedy in this matter have also been considered. As the committee notes in its report, allegations of wrongdoing are often made to members of parliament. As members, we enjoy very special rights, which are greater than those enjoyed by ordinary citizens. The privilege of freedom of speech is the greatest of these, but its very significance is such, where the reputation or welfare of persons may be an issue, that it should be used judiciously. If a member is of the opinion that it is in the public interest to disclose such allegations, the committee believes that the member should make all reasonable inquiries as to the truth of the allegations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The raising of a matter in full detail in the House is only one of the options available. Some members have questioned the judgment exhibited by the honourable member for Kennedy in his use of the privilege of freedom of speech to divulge as he did and to rely so heavily on the allegations contained in Mr Ellems's statutory declaration. The committee notes, however, that in the final analysis it is for each member to resolve whether or not it is in the public interest to raise such a matter in the House and his or her actions will be judged accordingly. In light of its conclusions, the committee has found that a contempt was not committed in respect of the initiation of the action complained of against Mr A. Cross and Mr R. Ellems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second report that I have just presented follows the consideration by the committee of a resolution of the House on 26 June 1994. The reference followed the introduction in the Senate of a private senator's bill by Senator Kernot which, in turn, followed the dispute that had arisen between the Senate Select Committee on Certain Aspects of Foreign Ownership Decisions in relation to the print media and the government over the production of documents concerning Foreign Investment Review Board decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee invited submissions from members of the public, members of the House and persons who had made submissions to the Senate Committee of Privileges. The committee concluded that the evidence available did not establish that it would be desirable for legislation to be enacted to transfer to the Federal Court responsibility to adjudicate in respect of claims for public interest immunity made in response to orders of a House or a parliamentary committee for the production of information or documents. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I am pleased to table the report of the inquiry of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs into the use of the Commonwealth coat of arms. This report is a review of the use of the coat of arms which was granted to the Commonwealth in 1912 by royal warrant. There are two main aspects of the inquiry. First, the committee examined whether authorised use of the coat of arms should include both official Commonwealth use and non-Commonwealth use. Second, the committee assessed whether specific legislation is needed to protect the coat of arms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the first point, we have concluded that, in principle, the coat of arms should be available to be used not only for official Commonwealth use but also for limited non-Commonwealth use. Authorised non-Commonwealth use may include display of the arms on the dress uniforms of national representative sportspersons. Such use has been authorised in the past, and the committee considers that this type of use should be able to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also considers that the arms should be available to be used for other non-official purposes. In particular, the committee considers that it would be appropriate to authorise the use of the arms for the commemoration of special events taking place within Australia. The 1988 Australian bicentenary is an example of a suitable occasion in the past where commemorative souvenirs bearing the coat of arms were authorised to be produced. The centenary of Federation is one future occasion where the authorisation of such commemorative souvenirs would also be appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee does not, however, recommend that the coat of arms should be widely and indiscriminately used. In all cases, where determining whether non-Commonwealth use should be authorised, the status of the coat of arms as the pre-eminent Australian national symbol should be preserved. For this reason, the committee recommended that the Minister for Administrative Services have a discretion to approve requests to use the coat of arms. The committee also made recommendations requiring the minister, in exercising that discretion, to take account of the need to protect the dignity and status of the arms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recognises that one reason for the popularity of the coat of arms with potential users is that the arms are an attractive national symbol that is distinctively Australian. For those intending users whose applications to use the arms are not successful, the committee has suggested that an alternative symbol be created in the form of a badge. A badge used in this context is a technical term for a symbol often based on a coat of arms. This will provide an opportunity for the development of another distinctively Australian national symbol, one which will be able to be more widely used than the coat of arms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the second aspect of this inquiry, the committee considers that the coat of arms is a revered national symbol in which Australians take pride. To protect the arms, the committee recommends that specific legislation be enacted. The legislation proposed in this report is to be comprehensive in its protection of the coat of arms. It is to include provisions that prohibit the importation of items bearing the coat of arms, unless such imports are authorised by the minister. The proposed legislation is also to provide for penalties which are able to be imposed on any person found guilty of unauthorised use of the arms. The implementation of our recommendations will provide guidance in the development of a management system for the coat of arms, which should ensure both certainty and flexibility in the administration of the management of the coat of arms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I acknowledge the work of the committee secretariat. The committee secretary, Judy Middlebrook, the subcommittee secretary, Claressa Surtees, and the other staff, Kelly Williams and Gemma Searles, all made significant contributions to the inquiry and the report. On behalf of the committee and the parliament, I thank them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;As Deputy Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I was pleased that we received this reference in regard to the Australian coat of arms. The report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The use of the coat of arms&mdash;armed with national pride</EMPHASIS>, is a comprehensive report on the simple use of the Australian symbol which is a fine combination of heraldic expression and patriotism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has decided that the main use of the coat of arms should continue to be the identification of Commonwealth property and the mark of Commonwealth authority&mdash;that is, on official documents, communications and the like. It is not for use on uniforms, it would not be an identification that would be used for souvenirs, but it would be a stamp of official recognition of Commonwealth authority. This posed a problem for us because many people came to the committee saying, `We like the Australian coat of arms. It is a very fine expression symbolising all the elements of Australia, with the kangaroo and emu, and then the six badges of the various states incorporated on the shield at the centre and covered at the top by the seven pointed star.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee decided&mdash;for uniforms, identification, souvenirs; for all of the various purposes that people mentioned to us as being the reason they wanted to use the Australian coat of arms&mdash;that a badge should be developed, that there should be a national competition and an Australian badge of a suitable type designed and that the Commonwealth should then allow the fairly free use of the Commonwealth badge to be used in many of the ways that people would want to use the coat of arms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I endorse the recommendations. The committee proposes that the Minister for Administrative Services have ultimate discretion to approve requests for the use of the coat of arms so there is government and ministerial control of the processes and so that the importation of goods is controlled. The minister then can prevent the entry into Australia, through the customs process, of material bearing the coat of arms if it has not been approved. The discrete use of this emblem will continue to provide a focus of pride and prestigious expression of the feelings that Australians have for their nation. To have the coat of arms in the Senate and above the Speaker's chair in this chamber is a suitable way to have the arms displayed representing the nation, the Commonwealth of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted to have been part of this report. I am very pleased with the result of the inquiry. I want also to thank the chairman of the committee, the members, and those who participated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the committee's report, incorporating a minority report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's participation in peacekeeping</EMPHASIS>, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The reference to inquire into Australia's participation in peacekeeping was given to the committee in July 1993, following a dramatic increase in Australia's contribution to peacekeeping missions. In March of that year 2,012 Australian Defence Force personnel had been deployed in a range of missions in troubled parts of the world. It was clear to the committee that further requests would be made to Australia by the United Nations for assistance. This was subsequently borne out by the request for a contingent to be sent to Rwanda.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The terms of reference for this inquiry focus on the Australian Defence Force. Very early in the inquiry, however, it became evident to the committee that peacekeeping could no longer be planned, developed and carried out as an almost exclusively military activity. Peacekeeping increasingly involves civilian organisations. Post-Cold War peacekeeping encompasses non-traditional peace support activities, such as facilitating elections, assisting in law and order and providing humanitarian relief. These are often essential prerequisites to achieving longer term political and economic stability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Governments need to give as much consideration to rehabilitation and reconstruction as they do to deployment. While the military will undoubtedly continue to play a significant role in peacekeeping, it is likely that longer term success will depend to a very large extent on civilian organisations, such as the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Electoral Commission and a wide range of non-government organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overwhelming conclusion of this inquiry is that the nature of peacekeeping in the post-Cold War world has changed so dramatically that a quite fundamentally different approach must be taken to peacekeeping. Firstly, the committee believes that, if peacekeeping is to succeed in bringing about global peace and stability, an integrated plan must be devised cooperatively by the various components of each mission. This means that civilian organisations must be brought into the planning of peacekeeping operations at an early stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, and most importantly, long-term strategic goals are integral to peacekeeping missions. No longer does it necessarily suffice to bring adversaries to the negotiating table. Experience in Somalia and Cambodia has demonstrated in different ways that the establishment of conditions to ensure ongoing peace and stability after the peacekeepers have withdrawn may be critical to the success of such missions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amongst other things, this report reflects the committee's concern with the problems that are continuing to be met by the United Nations headquarters in New York in planning for and conducting peacekeeping operations. While reform of the UN is the responsibility of its 184 members, the committee believes that it is incumbent upon countries, such as Australia, that have considerable expertise and experience in peacekeeping to take a leading role in the reform process. Therefore, the report makes a number of recommendations to this end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major concern arising from this inquiry was the extent to which the deployment of signallers to Cambodia, and the battalion group to Somalia, had an impact on the capacity of the Australian Defence Force to carry out its normal activities for the defence of Australia. The committee found that the deployment of signallers to Cambodia affected the ability of the divisional signal regiment to provide communications within Australia. This had ramifications for training. Moreover, the commitment of the force to Somalia for four months stretched the resources of the ADF beyond acceptable limits. The committee believes that Australia's participation in peacekeeping has revealed serious weaknesses in Australia's combat capability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee did not accept the view that only four regular battalions, supplemented by the ready reserve, were the right balance for the Australian Army and, therefore, canvassed this issue throughout the inquiry. Indeed, the committee was gratified to find that a number of proposals that it had canvassed during the inquiry were reflected in the defence white paper. The committee wholeheartedly endorses the decision to create a 5th Regular Infantry Battalion. The committee recommends, however, that this be established within two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee had been somewhat critical of the publication by the Department of Defence of its view that an average base of 200 peacekeepers was an appropriate level of contribution. The committee was pleased to note that, according to the white paper, Defence now prefers not to set numerical targets for the level of forces committed to the United Nations. The committee also notes that Defence is examining ways to ensure the UN maximises the benefit from Australian participation in peacekeeping. To this end, the committee recommends that a peacekeeping institute be established to provide training for Australian and regional personnel involved in peacekeeping, including civilian participants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among other things, such an institute would develop cooperation with regional defence forces and civilian institutions involved in peacekeeping and would serve as a focus of information and expertise in Australia. The committee believes that an Australian peacekeeping institute would strengthen Australia's contribution to international peacekeeping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make it clear that, whatever concerns the committee has had concerning defence capability, they do not extend to our peacekeepers. Indeed, the committee is proud of the way in which Australian serving men and women have performed their duties in the course of deployment on peacekeeping missions. Their professionalism and zeal for their tasks has been impressive and is recognised internationally. We found that our own very high opinion of our peacekeepers is widely shared by the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to record the committee members' sincere appreciation for the untiring efforts of our committee secretary, Gillian Gould. Gillian not only performed to her own very high standards but sadly had to contend with a very personal loss during this inquiry. I also wish to acknowledge the contribution of Alan Tebb, from the Department of Defence, as well as the support staff from the secretariat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to acknowledge the contribution of the deputy chairman of the committee, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). I thank all the members of the defence subcommittee for their interest and contribution to the committee and, in particular, to the exercising of this reference from the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray). I commend this report to the House and its 50-odd recommendations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I commend the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), and endorse the remarks he has just made. I would also like to extend to the secretary of the committee, Ms Gillian Gould, not only congratulations on the report but also sympathy for the loss she suffered during the preparation of the report. Nonetheless, she really has made a great contribution to the report and all of us recognise that it is a complex field. The fact that we finished with 50 recommendations rather endorses that fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to understand that, in dealing with a report of this character, it is very complementary to the white paper on defence that has just been tabled in the House. Indeed, several of our recommendations, in part, were picked up by the white paper. For example, the chairman of the committee referred to the 5th Regular Infantry Battalion. There is no doubt that had this committee report come out earlier we might have been able to claim the credit. But, from our point of view, we can see the need for a 5th Regular Infantry Battalion with the increasing obligations for peacekeeping and have suggested that it should be initiated within the next two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hope that the government can adopt that because there have been enormous pressures put on the force structure during the time we have had commitments to peacekeeping. Sadly, they have not all been met because of the nature and circumstances of other demands on the forces. In my view, it is important that we do have a capacity to maintain that peacekeeping effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of matters to which the chairman did not refer, and I will identify a couple of them. One was our concern about the stresses of peacekeeping on those who serve and also on the families of those who serve. Unfortunately, there is also a fallout in the nature and character of any military commitment. It is of concern to us that, unfortunately, many who serve abroad return stressed. We were told of some problems as a result of the commitment in Somalia, and we are certainly aware of pressures on the families. We commend to the government those recommendations that pick that up. It is no use looking at the overall national good without recognising the impact on the individuals concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have made a number of recommendations in respect of future training, and they in particular are something the government should also pick up. For example, recommendation 50 recommends an Australian peacekeeping institute be established within the Australian Defence Studies Centre. We see the problems of trying to look at the diversity of peacekeeping such that we need to look at how Australia can best be involved. While the numbers may be down at the moment, without doubt there are far too many flash points around the world. While the United Nations, the European Community and NATO seem so inept in the former Yugoslavia situation, there are other situations where I believe peacekeeping has been very effective. We in Australia should do all we can to assist towards success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are too many instances around the world where, without the commitment of the United Nations, undoubtedly not only would there be further inhumanity to man but also there would be quite significant abuses of power and situations where, particularly, ethnic divisions threaten the continuity of world peace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have picked that up and believe that, as far as Australia is concerned, we should therefore maintain our peacekeeping effort. I am disappointed that peacekeeping has not been accepted as part of the force structure objectives of government in the white paper. I see advantages in that, particularly at a time when it seems the government is intent on downsizing numerically the number of the services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the report to the government and to the Australian public. Australia has every reason to be very proud of the role it has played. I believe that, if the government picks up these recommendations, our contribution in the future will be even more distinguished. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the House, at its rising, adjourn until Tuesday, 31 January 1995, at 12.30 p.m., unless otherwise called together by Mr Speaker or, in the event of Mr Speaker being unavailable, by the Deputy Speaker.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the traditional motion by which at the end of each year those on both sides of the chamber who have some responsibility give their thanks to all those who have been great contributors to the affairs and the running of the parliament in the course of the year. It is also an opportunity to place on record appreciation of colleagues who may be about to retire or who may assist particularly in the running of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has indicated that he wants to come in and give his own personal thoughts on this, and he will no doubt do so fairly shortly. Whilst he is coming down, it presents me with an opportunity to give my thanks. I must say that these are a little less dramatic than the valedictories of last year. As I recollect, last year John Dawkins resigned. He took up a much better life than that which is led by most of us in this place. He certainly looks very healthy. He has done very well indeed. There is nothing so dramatic for the government to announce in the course of these valedictories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a few people I want to thank. I would firstly like to thank those on our side who assist me most vigorously in the running of the House. I refer in particular to the Chief Government Whip, Leo McLeay, who has had some new responsibilities thrust upon him. No doubt in his contribution to the valedictory debate he would like to say something about the functioning of the second chamber. He now has two whips assisting him&mdash;Ted Grace and Rod Sawford. They have had some elevation during the year to provide that assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second running of the House combined with a three-session parliament has made a miraculous contribution to the conduct of affairs in this place. I do not think members realise how much. We have operated this session without a guillotine. The reason we are able to operate this session without the guillotine is unquestionably the presence of the second chamber. Something like 30 or 40 bills are now considered in that chamber, all of which require a few hours discussion because there are people in the House with specific interests in them. It often all adds up to about 100 to 150 hours worth of debate that we would have had in this place. That has virtually been removed from the chamber into the second chamber and is conducted at much more leisure there. This has had a very substantial and beneficial impact. But it requires a bit of work, and that work is done by the whips. I thank them for that as well as for the many services they perform in the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to thank you, Mr Speaker, and your deputies, Harry Jenkins and Allan Rocher. You have to conduct affairs in this House in extraordinarily difficult circumstances. You do the very best you can. You prevail against the best endeavours of members of the chamber to frustrate your capacity to carry out your duties. I must say that you do that particularly well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to thank our caucus members on this side of the House who have made such a contribution in debates during the year and who, in their long suffering, have had difficulties imposed upon them by the House organisation. I want to pay a personal tribute to two other groups of people. The first group includes the Clerk of the House, Lyn Barlin, the Deputy Clerk of the House, Ian Harris, the assistant clerks, the Serjeant-at-Arms and all the staff of the House of Representatives. It is usually this time of the year that their mettle is truly tested, but it is tested pretty solidly throughout the course of the year. They are great protectors of the interests of the House of Representatives, more than most members of the House realise. They do a particularly fine job. They run one of the great democratic chambers of the world and are justifiably proud of the function they perform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to thank a second group; that is, PLO. I thank Anna Clendinning and her assistants&mdash;Ann-Louise Crotty, Ruth Adam, Lynn Irby and Andrew Jenson. From the government side, they really keep the House crumbling along very effectively indeed. We on both sides of the House are all aware of the debt that we owe them for the work that they do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to thank my personal staff in that regard. In terms of the activities of the House, I thank John O'Callaghan. He has recently rejoined my staff and does a particularly effective job in terms of the running of the parliament. I select only him from my staff, who work long hours and very satisfactorily, because of the function that he performs here in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank too the Hansard staff for the job they do and the members of the Sound and Vision Office. It is a time of the year when we can thank and wish all the best of the season to the attendants who look after us in this chamber, the catering staff who look after us outside this chamber, the maintenance and ground workers, the cleaners and the staff generally of parliament. This is an enormous factory when it all boils down to it. The dimensions of it are physically huge. The number of personnel who keep us serviced&mdash;from the library, from the Joint House Department and from all the divisions of the operation of the parliament&mdash;are an extraordinary phalanx indeed. There are not that many of us, and we are a very small tip of a very big iceberg for whom this parliament forms a substantial part of our lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think all of us want to thank our families. I know I thank mine. They are long suffering. This is not a profession which sits easily with family life and they bear a terrible burden. They will get a little piece of us over the next few weeks&mdash;not as much as they would have once had because we sit earlier and earlier these days, but at least this is the time of the year that goes to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I want to thank John Howard and his deputies on the opposition side of the House. He is a very experienced parliamentarian, one of the most experienced in the chamber. He graces it as an opposition spokesman and as an organiser of opposition business. He is well assisted both in the National Party and in the Liberal Party. I thank them all for the contribution they make to the running of the chamber. I would like to wish all members all the best for Christmas and the new year. </PARA>

I think we both quite like the game of rugby league. You have played perhaps later on in life a more active role in the game than I have but it is a fairly vigorous game. On occasions, I think exchanges here have had some of the elements of a great rugby league clash. I thank you for your great decency. I believe that you mean well. I wish you, your wife and family a very enjoyable Christmas and, in a personal sense, a very happy new year. I would also like to say how much I have enjoyed being Kim Beazley's opposite number.

He is a person, as I am, who respects this institution. The real dividing line in this place in a sense is not down the centre, but rather between those people who have a feel for the parliament and those who do not. There are many opposite who have a feel for the parliament. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has a feel for the parliament. He has had a go at me once or twice&mdash;I understand that&mdash;and I have had a go at him once or twice. The Leader of the House has a great feel for the parliament.

We thank him most sincerely for that, particularly as in the last couple of years he has worn the burden of the finance minister's job which is high on paper and a difficult grind.

They, too, do a good job at ensuring we get through our work. It is a great burden, of course, for the Speaker in our system of government to be sitting in the central cockpit of our national politics. Adjudicating the game, day in day out, is hard. You must in the end earn some enmity amongst people, and I am sure speakers take it to heart. The thing to know is not to take it too much to heart. We say that most especially also to the Deputy Speaker and the Second Deputy Speaker, who also carry the burden when the Speaker is not in the chair and, of course, when the Speaker is abroad. We thank the three of them for their forbearance and their humour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House has adopted various new procedures this year. The Main Committee has played, I think, an important role in spreading the legislation load more evenly across the sittings. I think that has worked; I think most people think that has worked. The rostered question time, I think, has ensured that members have the opportunity to question all the ministers rather than, perhaps, there being a concentration on the Prime Minister and Treasurer and the other ministers in the control portfolios. I think this is a major improvement. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The staff of the Parliamentary Library plays a very important role in informing the rank and file members of this place. I remember when I first came here, when the library was perhaps in its infancy in terms of the development of members' services. It was of great use to me, and I am sure to most members, to have that facility and to be able to go there and get support, which you do not perhaps normally have in the general infrastructure that members are provided with. I think they have developed and maintained considerable expertise and we thank all of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also express my thanks to the switchboard staff, Marlene and her coworkers Margaret, Pam, Ann and Gaylene. I know things are quite happy there. One does not remember ministers' office numbers but I do remember the Parliament House switchboard number, so I am a caller on occasions&mdash;many, many occasions. Yesterday there was a lot of mirth on the end of the line and I had to wait for the mirth to settle before we got connected. At least they are a happy band. That means that, at least, someone is getting served properly along the way as a consequence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to thank the other people who work here who make life pleasant for us and maintain these surroundings&mdash;the gardeners, the cleaners, the painters and others we do not see so much in the corridors but whom we would miss if their work ceased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of us who lived in the old building&mdash;John Howard amongst them&mdash;will notice that there was a bit of a change coming up here. This chamber does not have the atmosphere of the old building, I think. People do sit too far away. When I was on the new and permanent Parliament House committee for seven long years, one of the things I wanted to do away with was this table and the books which, of course, we never refer to, or, if we were to have a table, to narrow it so that the members would sit closer together and it would be not so much a word and sentence throwing chamber but a debating chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been set up with a lot of space, facility and amenity, but I wonder whether we have missed a bit along the way. I think we might have. In the British House of Commons ministers can put their heels on the table. You often see it. That means they are a lot closer than is the case here. I always thought it was a good thing for the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition to sit along the front bench rather than at the table. I was not particularly enamoured of sitting at the table here, but now I end up with so many notes I need a bit of space to put them down. I actually think it is probably worth hanging onto it. The chamber lacks a bit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing is that members do not have natural points of congregation in the building. Therefore, life is a bit more lonely here than it was in the old building. You can do without running into the odd journo at every corner, I know&mdash;we have at least saved ourselves that&mdash;but you do not run into anyone else much either. You have your splendid isolation in, admittedly, a very spacious room&mdash;that is a help&mdash;but I think we could probably do something over time to make the building a little more amenable, more interesting, to have places where people could congregate and feel like at least you belong to the main game, which you do not quite, I think, here. I do not think that is good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We thank all those people that keep the thing going&mdash;the gardeners, the cleaners, the painters, et cetera&mdash;because the grounds are nice, the place is pleasant and it is well looked after. We appreciate that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, of course, there are those who guard us and feed us and keep us travelling. That is important to all of us. The transport officers have been part and parcel of every member's existence. We thank the staff of the cafeteria for their commitment to us as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few people thanked their families, and I am thinking here of the families of all of us involved in this institution. It makes a very big demand on us and on our families with long and irregular hours. I hope the hours are better now. I think they are. Rising at 6 o'clock on Thursday night has made a difference, as has finishing at 8 o'clock. They are sensible hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I first came here&mdash;this is not a commentary on the coalition particularly but just a fact of life of the way it used to be&mdash;we would sometimes sit through until 5 o'clock or 6 o'clock in the morning. Often I would go back to the Hotel Kurrajong in daylight to have a shower and have breakfast and come back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We instituted the 11 o'clock rule in 1972 and from there we have now gone to 8 o'clock at night and the back to back four-day weeks rather than, in my day, three days on for three weeks out of four. It is now two four-day weeks back to back with people rising at 6 o'clock on Thursdays, which lets many members get home when they would not otherwise be able to. That means another night at home with the family, et cetera. In this International Year of the Family, I think it is appropriate that we extend our best wishes and gratitude to the families of those who work here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say briefly&mdash;I will not burden the House too long&mdash;that we are here for a purpose, all of us. The purpose is, of course, to keep the country growing, prospering and moving. I can assure you that I am delighted by the fact that the economy is growing in the way that it is, at six per cent, and that we have had job growth of 430,000 since April 1993. In fact, jobs have been created at the rate of 700 a day in the last 12 months, which is a lot. The fall in unemployment over the last year of two per cent is the highest trend decrease since the unemployment records have been kept; that is, the fall in unemployment over the period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we really have seen, as a result of changes in the 1980s and maybe the recession, a change in the productivity culture of the country. We have productivity running in the non-farm economy at 4.6 per cent over the year. With the consumption deflator, if you look at the price of consumption goods for the last year, the rise is of 1.4 per cent. If you put those two things together, the six per cent and the 1.4 per cent, this is probably the best economic year since the war. I cannot think of any other year when we have had six per cent growth and 1.4 per cent inflation. Maybe there is one, but we would need to look. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At any rate, that is the point of the plot: to get people back to work. I think all of us in the House are happy that the long-term unemployed are getting more than the share they used to have of the jobs that are coming through. The prognosis is outstandingly good. I hope that the people of Australia feel that all of us have had a reasonable year. There will be more opportunities for Australians in the following year. I close by saying that this has been truly a good year for the country. While, at the moment, we traditionally thank members and the institutions of parliament, the greater credit goes to the people of this country, who have proven themselves to be resilient, resourceful, prepared to change and prepared to grab the future and hang on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to join with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and others in wishing all honourable members and those who work in this building the very best for Christmas and for a holiday break, which I know everybody here deserves very much. It has certainly been a very interesting year for the coalition. This was our 50th anniversary in the Liberal Party&mdash;50 great years in which we have, on average, dominated the political scene in this country. We are still in power in five of the six states in Australia and in six of the state and territory governments. Early next year we hope to add the ACT to our list. It will not be easy, but we are working at it. As I said, it has been a very interesting year for us&mdash;a year in which all of those on the other side should have learned one thing about us; that is, never to underestimate our resilience and determination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I join with those who have spoken so highly of the institution of parliament. As the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) pointed out, it is an institution that I have been familiar with all my life. It is an institution that I do not just have a historic enthusiasm for but an enthusiasm as an individual working in the parliament. Of course, our system has weaknesses, but on the whole I think it serves the Australian community fairly well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last month, a couple of delegations have visited my office&mdash;one was of politicians from Indonesia and the other involved aspiring politicians from the United States. I think they had the pleasure of watching our question time. They regarded it with some alarm and thought that it was not a model to take back to their own countries. I am not so sure. I think the way bits and pieces of the executive roll up every so often to answer questions and the way we have debates with the sort of vigour that we have give our whole political system much more life than other parliamentary or non-parliamentary democratic systems around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I could say that I had the displeasure when I was a diplomat of sitting and listening to some of the European parliaments. You would never want to go to that type of stolid institutional arrangement, where people stand up and make speeches which no-one listens to. It has none of the life of MPIs, censure motions, suspensions of standing orders and, above all, the vigour of question time. Nevertheless, there is some criticism from the community of our institution. Of course, it is your responsibility, Mr Speaker, and the responsibility of the majority party, to ensure that the parliament is carried on with a degree of decorum&mdash;not too much, but a degree. We still think a bit more needs to be done to improve the standards of the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the Prime Minister spoke enthusiastically about the roster system, he well knows that that is not an enthusiasm we happen to share. It would have been good to have had Laurie Brereton in here today for question time. There are more things that we would have liked to have asked him. Nevertheless, it is a great institution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the Prime Minister about the chamber. I did not serve in the old chamber for very long, but it had a great deal more atmosphere than this chamber. The nature of the debate was, as the Prime Minister said, in a sense, closer. Therefore, it had a bit more vibrance. People in the galleries, the press and others could hear the interjections. Our interjections, as you all know, are very witty and incisive, and I think they deserve to be heard more than they are heard. I think the nation has lost something by not being able to hear more of our brilliant interjections. This point about a narrower table is one that worries me. I would have to sit all the much closer to the Prime Minister. It would be interesting to see what difference that would make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank all of the coalition members for the great work that they have done through the year. Much of their work does not appear in the media, and therefore the public generally is not aware of it. They spend so much of their time working not just in their electorates but for their electorates. I often say to people in the community&mdash;members of the Labor Party would be pleased to hear this&mdash;that people underestimate the  tremendous amount of community work that members of parliament do. They just see us shouting at each other in question time and the like and do not see much else. Much of our work does not involve that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The work that coalition members have been doing in their electorates has been sterling and it is work for their communities. A lot of the work that they have done in committees is also unsung work. A lot of it is work where members on both sides of the House try to reach common agreement, putting forward recommendations, many of which are taken up by the executive. I do not think that side of our work should ever be underestimated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We lost one of our members during this year in Andrew Peacock when he resigned from the parliament. Andrew's departure has been a great loss not just to us but to the parliament as a whole. There was some discussion about that at the time of his retirement. He was a great parliamentarian, a man who shared with many of us a great love for the institution. He is certainly being sorely missed as a contributor to this institution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to extend my thanks to Tim Fischer, the Leader of the National Party, and John Anderson, the Deputy Leader of the National Party, for the great support they have given to the coalition and the leadership that they have shown to National Party members who invariably work very harmoniously with the Liberal Party. The relationship between our two parties is one that I regard as enormously important. We do not always agree on everything&mdash;we would not be in different parties if we did&mdash;but there is a great sense of team spirit and agreement between the Liberals and Nationals. That will remain, if I have my way, for ever and a day. </PARA>

To John Howard, the Manager of Opposition Business in the House, his experience and expertise have been absolutely invaluable to us. His work with me, Peter Costello, Tim Fischer, John Anderson and others in putting together our parliamentary tactics has been very much appreciated.

He should have looked for a safer seat than that! Nevertheless, he has undertaken his tasks, in terms of the organisation of the parliament, very proficiently during the year. There has been very good cooperation between him and John Howard. Obviously, that is crucial if this place is going to work properly.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this time it would be very useful to say something to the people who have done the work for that committee. I thank Harry Jenkins and the panel of Deputy Speakers who help him in organising that and in getting over a number of interesting procedural arrangements that we have never seen in this House but that up there, in the informal way that place works, work well. They have done well. There has not been an argument there yet. That is progress. A lot of that has to do with Deputy Speaker Jenkins. I thank Ian Harris and his staff, who have provided the advice and the flexibility that probably Lyn Barlin would not allow them to provide down here. In that way the Main Committee might be able to give a bit of a lean to this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the people who have done the duty for the Main Committee because to have people on duty both from the government and the opposition requires a bit of creativity, with parliamentary secretaries, government committee chairs and deputy chairs on the opposition side. The parliamentary liaison officer and her staff, in particular Ann Louise, who does the work for the Main Committee, have ensured that we have been able to run two chambers effectively and get the work done. A lot of that has to do with the staff of Bob Halverson and me. B.A. and her helpers have already been mentioned. Joan Connor in my office obviously is responsible for the good things there and Ted Grace, Rob Sawford and I are responsible for the bad things. Melinda Lowe and Kristel Griffiths, who help her, have made sure that the running of those two chambers has worked well. They have taken most of the load. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the government members and the opposition members have managed to adjust to the Main Committee well. That innovation has allowed us to do some of the things that both the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) spoke about here tonight. It has given us a bit of time to have sensible hours. It has given us a bit of time not to have the helter-skelter that we normally have at the end of the year. And I suppose on nights like tonight, and hopefully not tomorrow, it allows us to be able to party without too much difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank those people who did the nuts and bolts work. I particularly thank Bob Halverson, Noel Hicks and their deputies, and also Ted Grace and Rod Sawford, the two other government whips, for the work they have done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing I found interesting in the last year has been working closely with Kim Beazley, who, as others have said here tonight, probably has his finger on the pulse of this institution more and in a better way than anyone else. The only one who surpasses him is the Prime Minister, without whom what would question time be? I have always said in the past that Paul should be here every day because he added that extra dimension that used to get the government members to take a lot more interest in what happened. But now you are getting twice the punch on two days a week. Without the Prime Minister here at question time, question time loses a bit of its oomph. Even though he has said that from time to time I might ask him a controversial question, and there might not be all that much content in the question, there is a terrific bit of content in the answer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take this opportunity to echo some of the compliments that have been given to members of the parliamentary staff. As honourable members would know, the position of Speaker carries with it the responsibility for administering the Department of the House of Representatives, the Parliamentary Library, the Joint House Department and the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff. In each of those departments you could not find better personnel to serve the interests of members of this place. Nothing is too difficult for them. They spend a lot of time looking at ways in which they can make the lot of members and senators in this place easier. They certainly are a great credit to this institution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the departmental heads for the advice they continue to give me in this position. It is not easy when one has to administer four departments at the one time without necessarily having ministerial rank, but having that responsibility. I am always given first-rate advice, and I thank them for that. I would also like to thank all those people who work in those departments, whether they be attendants, gardening staff, people in the catering service, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> reporters or whomever. They are all true public servants in the purest sense of the term and we owe them a great deal of gratitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would particularly like to thank David Elder, the Serjeant-at-Arms. It is always good to have somebody of such enormous talent able to give advice very quickly. The fact that David came from a committee which I used to chair, of course, has nothing to do with it. He was well trained. David does an outstanding job for us all in this place and I think that is superb. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lyn Barlin, Ian Harris and the other clerks have also been singled out for special mention tonight. There is no doubt that the professionalism and the quality of advice which come from them are second to none in any parliament in the world. At any time, night and day, when there is a difficulty or I need to be referred to a section of the green book so that I understand clearly what I might have done or said in the House, Lyn has always been that source of good advice. To Lyn, Ian and the other clerks I say, thank you. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Speaker and the panel of deputy speakers have also been of great assistance to me and to this parliament this year. The rostering system has provided a great deal of opportunity for them to display their wares. From my observations when I am not here but am watching on television, I think they do a great job. I thank them all, particularly Harry Jenkins who, from time to time, had to step in for me. I recall that when I lost my voice at one stage he did a superb job and I thank him most sincerely for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also just like to say something about a couple of members of this place who are retiring and have given great service to the parliament. They are perhaps people a lot of members would not normally come across in their day-to-day work. Christine Page-Hanify has had managerial responsibility for developing the computer systems we have in this place. She has been responsible for the latest and greatest and was given advice by a committee we established so that members know the sorts of things they require. It was her job to implement that in this modern technological age. She has been headhunted and is going to the University of New South Wales. We wish her every success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">David Callan has handled the difficult responsibility of industrial relations in the Joint House Department. He too has been headhunted and is going to the Department of Defence. We wish David every success. He has kept any sort of difficulty in an industrial relations sense within the parliament well under control and I am sure he will do extremely well in that new capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some comment has been made about the hours of parliament, the operation of the second chamber, question time and other aspects of this chamber. We are very lucky in that we have a robust democracy and that we have an expression of that on a daily basis here. I take the points raised by both the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) in that respect. There are many parliaments where you have got no chance whatsoever of seeing prime ministers or ministers being subjected to questions. In many countries there is no chance at all for opposition leaders even to be in a parliament or even for such a position to exist. As a consequence, this form of democracy which Australia enjoys is something to be protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has also been mentioned, from time to time the opportunity for an expression of that democracy and how we perhaps respond to that, whether it be question time, censure motions or whatever the business of the parliament allows us to do, draws adverse comment and quite often a lot of that is directed to the occupant of this position. Nevertheless, it is a form of our democracy which we should always ensure we protect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> If you allow me some indulgence from my position of impartiality, I would like to respond to some comments made on the rostering system. When the government was thinking of introducing this system I said that this would provide an opportunity for all ministers to be put under the spotlight, to be accountable, to be responsible and to demonstrate the talents which their colleagues believe they have; hence their occupation of those positions. Similarly, it provides an opportunity for oppositions to question those people who might otherwise not ever get a question in this place. Too often we think about what is happening now and forget what it was like under the old system when two, three or maybe four ministers at most would get 95 per cent of the questions. I am not sure that really is a reflection of how we could operate in a democracy in its purest sense. I think it is working well. I have seen ministers in this place under some pressure, I have seen them respond and I have seen opposition members in this place put ministers under that scrutiny with questions. Therefore, on balance, it is working particularly well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to thank the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer)&mdash;indeed, all members in this place. Rightly has it been said&mdash;and I am famous for saying it&mdash;that the Speaker's job is not one for wusses, if you will forgive the unparliamentary language. I think that is probably right. The way in which people in this chamber generally have responsibility for adhering to standing orders and doing what we are after all elected to do is carried out with a great deal of ability. To those three members in particular I say thank you for the courtesies which you have extended me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally but one, I would like to thank my personal staff. Phil Bergin, Geraldine Skinner, Debra Biggs, Marie Donnelly, Claire Cooney and Carol Nichols are a group of staff who provide, as I have said earlier about the staff generally in this place, the purest form of public service. All members from time to time have had need to contact my office and I do not think they have ever been refused courteous attention&mdash;and that is the way it should be in a Speaker's office. They all bring special talents to that position and I would like to thank them most sincerely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I too would like to offer all members my best wishes for a safe, happy and holy festive season.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8T4">Mr FERGUSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;This report stems from a sustained effort by the shadow minister in this field, a few disaffected failed applicants for appointment and a predictable collection of journalists. The situation stems from appointments made in August this year which led to questions on notice from the shadow minister on 29 August, the matter being raised in the Victorian parliament and in the Senate on 11, 12, 13 and 20 October and, finally, as well as this particular inquiry, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) giving evidence before the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that, whilst this effort has been sustained, as I said, by this grouping, in the last week or so the Senate refused to call the minister before the inquiry. Today the Democrats and the Senate indicated their concern that the minority of the migration committee had not agreed to add to the report the legal and constitutional affairs legislation hearings. The position of the majority on this report is probably best summarised by page 52, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Committee is of the view that the appointments process was conducted in accordance with the guidelines and accepted practice for appointments to tribunals, including the recommendations of CROSROMD. The appointments were advertised widely. The advisory committee was constituted in accordance with the guidelines. There is no evidence to indicate that the advisory committee did not carry out its functions with due probity. Of the 750 persons who lodged expressions of interest for appointment to the IRT, only a handful provided submissions to the Committee indicating concerns about the selection process or about their own failure to be appointed or re-appointed.</PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, the report states on the next page:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a Minister acts within those guidelines, objective evidence needs to be provided to indicate that impropriety has occurred. Such evidence did not come to the fore during this inquiry. Indeed, witnesses such as Mr Clothier indicated that their evidence was based on hearsay.</PARA>
<PARA>The appointments should be seen in the context of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cabinet Handbook</EMPHASIS> and the 1993 policy of appointments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I note on page 15 of the committee report a quote which I think is very relevant to this. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A crucial aspect of the AAT appointments policy and procedure is the strong emphasis on the prerogative of the Minister in making appointments and re-appointments. Ministerial prerogative in relation to appointments also is emphasised in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cabinet Handbook</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1989 there was an investigation led by the former coalition minister for immigration, Mr Ian MacPhee. That Committee for the Review of the System for Review of Migration Decisions, CROSROMD, came to a number of conclusions and made a number of suggestions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note, in the context of complaints by the opposition, that the recommendations which were put to the government were: that the minister should continue to be responsible for the suggestion of people to the Governor-General; that there should be widespread advertising; that there should be interviews of more suitable candidates by an advisory committee appointed by the minister; that the committee should report on those candidates in accordance with publicly available selection criteria; and, finally and perhaps very relevantly, that the minister should remain entitled to use additional methods for identifying suitable candidates for appointment and should not be bound to accept the advisory committee's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is obviously a very strong emphasis on the minister's rights in this field, his prerogatives. If we look at section 394 of the relevant legislation, there are very few impediments&mdash;one of age and one of conflict of interest&mdash;that in any matter undermine the minister's overall right. During the inquiry, there was evidence particularly from Mr Clothier, the senior member in Victoria who failed to be reappointed. The minority report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government members of the Committee had decided that the best way to discredit both the written and oral submissions made to the inquiry by Mr Clothier was to build a case in favour of the proposition that he and his accusations were purely motivated by `sour grapes', and that his disappointment at not being re-appointed had clouded his judgment.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the view of the opposition about the government's attitude on this matter. It is very interesting to notice Mr Clothier's own comments on this matter. On page 22 he noted that he had never raised any problems about the 1989 appointments. He admitted that they were far more flawed than the latest appointments in 1994. He admitted the process was far worse because it preceded CROSROMD's suggestions. Lo and behold, in 1994 the process, with all of these improvements, suggested by MacPhee and the committee, was adhered to without any argument by the opposition, but Mr Clothier found this process to be wanting. His comment was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I got concerned to make a public issue after my non reappointment.</PARA>
<PARA>During evidence he sarcastically referred to a number of other threatened members&mdash;people who perceived themselves as threatened by not being reappointed. He said that they were going to the toilet because they were terrified by who was coming into the office, seeing members of the socialist Left who might replace them. He indicated to the committee that he did not have a concern in the world. He thought he was going to be reappointed. I think there is a very substantial case for `sour grapes'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To my mind, it is very interesting to note that, whilst he had continually referred to the political affiliations of Messrs Italiano and Bruce, despite those `dreadful' appointments, he could come to a number of interesting conclusions about those people. On page 16 of the evidence, he said that Italiano was `hardworking'. He said of Bruce:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, I do not think that Peter Bruce was a bad member; it is just that his productivity was very low.</PARA>
<PARA>He commented on Italiano again. He said that Italiano was `neck and neck' in terms of being the hardest working member of the tribunal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought nationally. Yes, that is correct, not just in Victoria. So here we had flawed appointments and people with political affiliations, just like some of those appointed at this time. But Mr Clothier, in the period he was the senior member, developed very rich relationships with these people who were such `dreadful' appointments. He went to barbecues with them and discussed the internal intricacies of the Victorian Labor Party. He said he felt himself to be `made an honorary member of the Labor unity'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we see here is a group of people who were sitting in those positions who felt they were threatened. They talked to Mr Clothier. He had minimal knowledge of the internal workings of the Labor Party. They exaggerated their own roles in the party operation. Mr Clothier, who himself conceded he had very little direct knowledge, came to a number of conclusions about the appointments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very interesting to note his own orientation. Quite frankly, one thing that I found rather disturbing is that when Mr Clothier was asked about who else he thought should be appointed he could only come up with two people, who were members of the same organisation as he. They were Mr Vrachnas of the Immigration Advice and Rights Centre and Ms Morton, the manager of the Victorian Immigration Advice and Rights Centre. He had been the secretary of the same organisation previously. What we have here, for practical purposes, is a group of people who feel that everyone who is appointed to this tribunal should stem from the same grouping, have the same community associations and have the same background and that if they are not all appointed it is a dreadful thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Clothier's other sustained effort was to put forward a proposition that he was of world shattering importance to immigration law in this country because he made a monumental decision in a case called Tordo. That was possibly the reason why he was not reappointed. Yet he himself conceded that he had to make a choice. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I had to make a choice whether I obeyed my conscience or whether I toed the line and I obeyed my conscience.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I had a choice to make: either I do it according to my conscience or I live in fear.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the kind of rhetoric we had from him. He did concede that there were two people in the same ballpark, people the government could not depend upon. The government would be concerned about the nature of decisions those two people would make. But he had to admit they were both reappointed, despite this independence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, we have a person who, from 1989 to 1994, had no worries about a process that was perhaps far more open to criticism; a person who had no worries on the day that interviews were occurring, because he thought he was on board for another term; and a person who, unfortunately, did not manage to sustain his view. No statistics were provided, for instance, of allegations that in the final 12 months there was a tendency for people to be scared about reappointment and for there to be a start of making happier decisions for the government. There were no statistics provided, no indications of evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee did come up with a few recommendations about appointments of lawyers to the senior position and about staggering appointments to make sure that numerous people do not come up for appointment at the same time. In conclusion, the report does indicate that, within the provisions of the legislation and the prerogatives that the minister has, there is no case made by the opposition's campaign. </PARA>

I find it disappointing to be one of those who have contributed in this matter to a very significant and major dissenting report, the others being the deputy chairman, Senator Jim Short, the right honourable Ian Sinclair MP and Mrs Kathy Sullivan MP. The committee was asked to look at a very serious matter: the manner and method of appointment, reappointment and non-reappointment of members of the Immigration Review Tribunal, and the effect that this process has on community confidence in, and the ability of, the tribunal to perform its duties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Immigration Review Tribunal is a very important organisation. It was established in 1989 to provide independent merits review in a situation where a determined effort was made by the government to take politics out of the decision making process about who should or should not enter Australia to settle here permanently. It was a very important and major step designed to create a culture in which politics were not involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very interesting that, in setting up an independent organisation to carry out this important task and the establishment of a specialist body, there was not a great deal of thought given&mdash;and I note that there has not been a great deal of thought given over time&mdash;to the question of what one's expectations ought to be about the nature of the appointments made to a body of this sort. I suspect the reason for that was that people would not expect one to ever bring into question appointments of such a character which were made. They are very much in the nature of judicial appointments, about which there is not a great deal written. You do not find anything written in the constitution or the Judiciary Act about the expectations one might have of the way in which people who are appointed to the courts might behave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is a very clear understanding about the expectations placed on judicial officers. I think there also is a clear understanding in relation to some other independent statutory review bodies, industrial commissions and the like&mdash;an expectation that, when people are appointed, they cease to have an active role in day-to-day political activities. In relation to judges&mdash;because something has been written, and a statement of that is in the minority report&mdash;it has been said, by Mr Justice Thomas in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Judicial ethics in Australia</EMPHASIS>, that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it seems fairly clear that, after appointment, a judge should not be an active member of any political party. He should not fraternise with those in the echelons of political power. He should not actively support causes which produce partisan reaction in the community. It would be improper for him to participate in a political party convention. As the divorce from political partisanship needs to be complete, he should resign from membership of any party. Continued silent membership could be seen as clandestine support.</PARA>
<PARA>What has happened in this case? The member for Reid (Mr Ferguson), who spoke before me, said that there were certain allegations by failed applicants for appointment to the Immigration Review Tribunal that prompted the opposition to take up those matters and make a political exercise of it; it was really all a matter of sour grapes on the part of some individuals. He has referred to Mr Clothier, a gentleman who was previously the senior member of the immigration tribunal in Victoria, who was not reappointed by the government&mdash;and I will say a little more about that appointment later. The member for Reid made some I think fairly disparaging comments about Mr Clothier. I do not know anything of Mr Clothier's political antecedents. I asked the question as to whether he had been a member of any political party, as I recall, and he said no. He was appointed to this role when I was shadow minister. If I had been asked where I thought his political allegiances lay, I would not have expected them to be with my side of politics. </PARA>

We did not complain about the advisory committee carrying out its functions with due probity. We think that that committee was, in fact, under the minister, carrying out its functions as he required it to carry them out. Of the members of that advisory committee, one was a member of the minister's staff, another was the head of the Immigration Review Tribunal and another was a member of the department. It was quite clear in relation to the evidence that they gave&mdash;and we have drawn very heavily on it&mdash;that matters relating to the appointments that we considered dubious were related to the minister's involvement and not the way in which the committee carried out its functions and responsibilities. Nor did we query whether the positions were advertised or whether the committee was constituted in accordance with the guidelines. They were not the questions. </PARA>

That is the issue. You have to ask yourself whether the appointments he made were appropriate, given all of the surrounding circumstances that have been outlined in the minority report. I think any reasonable person reading that report would come to the view that they were inappropriate appointments or, as we have said, dubious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to Mr Alevizos, he is a gentlemen who had been a guest at the minister's wedding fairly recently and was appointed to an additional full-time post in South Australia where there is some question as to whether or not a full-time post was in fact required. He was appointed over a person who was later appointed to the most senior position in Victoria. He was not shortlisted by the panel, of which the minister asked to be advised. The minister did not interview any of the applicants in relation to this appointment. Yet the appointment was made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Labbozzetta was appointed as a part-time member of the New South Wales tribunal some years ago. He sat on only four cases in five years, and three of them were jointly with somebody else, so he did not have to write a decision. He produced only one decision in that five-year term. The advisory panel recommended against his appointment. So the minister set up an advisory committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee rightly said that it did not think it was an appropriate appointment to make. That is very clear. But, almost by immaculate conception, and over a whole lot of other sound applicants, the minister determined that this gentlemen should be made a part-time member again. The minister also accepted that, even though Mr Labbozzetta is and has been the subject of press publicity in respect of charges in relation to a club that he is associated with in New South Wales, he will stand down for a period of time until that matter is resolved and will then come back and work, presumably on a conscientious basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was pulled out of 800 applicants and put at the top of the pile. It was not done by the advisory committee&mdash;we are not complaining about that&mdash;but it was done by the minister. Let us look at some of the other people who were not appointed. One of them, Ms Turner, was a former secretary of the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio). Another was Dr Witton. I did not know Dr Witton before he came in but I have talked to him and he seems a nice, pleasant fellow. I found out that he was a member of the ALP too. When you look at the factors that have been involved in some of this decision making, he did not have any inappropriate credentials. He has been very conscientious. We looked at his record of decision making. But he was found to be unsuitable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Head was appointed a full-time member of the IRT in Victoria before this process of recent appointments was undertaken. But after the CROSROMD report&mdash;which has been referred to&mdash;the position was not advertised, an advisory panel was not set up and no interviews were conducted. If you look at the workload, there was no particular evidence that there was a greater demand for a new appointment in Victoria over and above New South Wales. Yet, he was appointed. Coincidentally, he just happened to be the ALP's preselected candidate for the upper house seat of Waverley in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know all the factors that are involved in people's capacities, but it seems extraordinary that, out of 800 applicants, a number of other known political activists were appointed, particularly in Victoria. Nikki Dollis was appointed a full-time member, and she is the wife of the Victorian state Leader of the Opposition, who was, I understand, best man recently at the minister's wedding. Mr Joe Italiano was reappointed full time, and he is the preselected ALP candidate for the seat of Werribee. Ms Lynne Kosky was appointed part time and is the preselected ALP candidate for the seat of Altona. Ms Pippy Watson was reappointed as a part-time member and is the former private secretary of Senator Robert Ray and was originally appointed by him to the body. Ms Patti Warn was appointed a part-time member in New South Wales, and is known to many around this place as being very actively involved in the Labor Party and as serving many Labor politicians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the 22 people interviewed for appointment in Victoria&mdash;and we know the minister was involved in suggesting names of those he would like to see interviewed&mdash;10 of them were named by Mr Clothier in his evidence as being members of the ALP. They were: Mr Peter Spyker, Mr Gary Shepherd, Mr Stefano De Piri, Ms Lynne Kosky, Ms Nikki Dollis, Ms Lidia Argondizzo, Mr Ray Rooke, Mr Joe Italiano, Mr Peter Bruce and Ms Pippy Watson. I mention all of this because, when we questioned the head of the Immigration Review Tribunal on this issue of the appropriateness of people maintaining political associations, a number of people actually took the decision to resign from the Labor Party when they took up appointments. Ms O'Neil, the principal member, took that course, which I think was a proper course to take. In relation to another gentleman who was not reappointed in South Australia, he resigned from the Labor Party because he took the view that it was inappropriate to continue that involvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My view generally is that, now that this issue has become clear, if we are going to have a merit review body, the recommendation proposed by me and my colleagues should be picked up. We have recommended that all full-time members appointed to the Immigration Review Tribunal should withdraw from active political involvement by resigning any party membership. We have also recommended that, if a full-time member is nominated as a political candidate for a given election, he should resign from his position. If we are going to maintain community confidence in the ability of the tribunal to be able to perform its duties, that is the only proper and appropriate standard that should be expected in relation to an organisation of this character that is expected to undertake merit reviews. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also made some other recommendations and I draw them to the attention of members. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.the selection criteria for the appointment of Senior Members to the Immigration Review Tribunal specify that legal qualifications or a legal background or equivalent experience is desirable; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.interviews be conducted in all States where full-time members are to be appointed to the Immigration Review Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA>The very fact that the majority of the committee went as far as to make the two recommendations is saying that the process in this case was clearly defective and inappropriate. Clearly, the appointment of a person without legal training&mdash;and who was not considered suitable to be appointed as the senior and only person in South Australia as a full-time member&mdash;as the principal member of the Immigration Review Tribunal in Victoria has to be seen as a suspect appointment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She came from Western Australia, where she had had senior executive service, but it was only after having given very distinguished service in the office of the minister and, I think, the Premier of Western Australia. With that experience, she was given the opportunity to serve in the Western Australian public service. She was not shortlisted for Victoria, she did not apply to go to Victoria, but in the end was given the appointment which the government members have come to the view, in support of their minister, that Mr Clothier was unsuitable to continue to hold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is certainly the view of my colleagues&mdash;I think it is the view of government members when you look at the nature of their recommendations&mdash;that the appointment of Ms Scott was clearly questionable. It could not happen again under the guidelines that the government is asking us to adopt; nor could some of the other appointments that have been made be made under the guidelines that it is asking us to adopt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the report has been written on a political basis by government members seeking to defend their minister. Any objective reading of the evidence, particularly the evidence that we have adduced as part of the minority report&mdash;I do not think it can be refuted&mdash;would clearly lead one to the view that the whole process was flawed and defective. It has brought the government into disrepute. It has brought the Immigration Review Tribunal into disrepute. It warrants some fundamental reforms to the process. Having now examined it and seen the way in which appointments are made by a minister without an adequate system of guidelines, we believe flawed appointments can be made. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I listened with great interest to the assertions made by the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock). As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, I am bound to disagree with a number of his assertions. The first point I want to make seems to have been totally omitted by our colleagues in the opposition. I refer to the directions this parliament gave to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) through the legislation. If the view of the coalition at the time was the same as that asserted by Mr Clothier, one of the witnesses who was strongly of the view that only people with legal qualifications and backgrounds should be appointed&mdash;he made no apology for that view&mdash;then why did the coalition not insist that that provision go into the legislation?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question before the committee was not the wish list of the coalition. The question before the committee was: was there any evidence at all of the minister not complying with the provisions of the act or not complying with the express wishes of this parliament set out in the legislation? It does not matter how the honourable member for Berowra might confect all kinds of political conspiracies. The answer to that simple question is no. The parliament gave very clear and wide discretionary powers to the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened to the argument of the honourable member for Berowra. He said that, if you take one of these appointments, you should resign from all your political connections. That is true for members of the judiciary. Why? Because in almost all cases they are appointments for life. There is a notable exception to that. A very significant number of judges who were appointed for life have been sacked in Victoria. It is a matter of major concern to the legal profession in my state, yet I have not heard any concern voiced by the honourable member for Berowra. He might argue that he is not a Victorian, but I have heard no concern from any Victorian member of the coalition in this House about the fact that judges and people exercising high judicial office have been sacked at the political whim of a Liberal coalition government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of a sudden, we have a different set of balances, a different set of scales. As a judge recently said in a tragic case in Victoria, life means life. But it is also true that an appointment for five years means an appointment for five years. It does not mean an appointment for life. It does not mean that you will necessarily be reappointed because you have an overweening view of your own ability. An appointment for five years means precisely that. It may well be that, when you take all the factors into consideration, the parliament has said to the minister, `It's a matter for your discretion.' That is the argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the somewhat limp proposition of my colleague the honourable member for Berowra, let me say this: I have never argued, and will never argue, that members who, as a result of their political philosophy, their view of Australian society and their commitment to improve their perception of this society, publicly join a political party have any more rights than anyone else, but I am not prepared to concede an argument that on the basis of a five-year appointment they have fewer rights. That, in essence, is the argument of my colleague. He made a nonsensical proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having been a minister for immigration, I can do no better than to say that, if my colleague the honourable member for Berowra through some misfortune in a preselection ballot lost his position but wanted to continue in that position as a result of his deep commitment to the philosophy of the Liberal Party and his background, knowledge and commitment to resolving some of the many problems surrounding immigration, I would regard him as an eminently suitable person for a five-year appointment on a tribunal of this kind. But I do not believe he should be forced to resign from the Liberal Party in order to take up a five-year appointment. If he believes it is appropriate, that is a matter for his personal judgment. But I will not argue that, because of his philosophical and political commitment, he automatically has to disqualify himself from a position for which I believe he would be eminently qualified. I cannot argue that when making a day-to-day decision on the rights of people to seek to become citizens of Australia, which falls within the provisions of the act, the member for Berowra would not act responsibly, sensibly and in a balanced way. That is what flaws this minority report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spent some time questioning Mr Clothier. I am bound to say that I reached the conclusion&mdash;I was not told within the legal profession&mdash;that he was a man skilled in immigration law. But I reject his view that the only people who had some preferment in appointment were qualified lawyers. I say quite frankly, as I act on behalf of many immigrants in my capacity as a member of parliament, that some of the biggest shonks in this whole field are practising lawyers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue is simply this: if this parliament gives the minister a very broad discretion to make appointments for five years, we are not entitled to allow a disappointed and frustrated lawyer who believes because he is a lawyer with not inconsiderable skills to say, `I am going to be there forever.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She is as committed in her integrity and honesty as the honourable member for Berowra, but she was somehow considered to be less worthy. Why? Does anybody say she is an unfit mother? She is not. Does anybody say that, as a result of her background, she does not have a passionate concern for social justice and a commitment to a political party? Mr Clothier says that, because she happens to be a member of a political party and he is a lawyer, he should get appointed. All of a sudden this person with whom he has worked becomes unworthy. What do we do about Mr Clothier's evidence when he says of another member of the Labor Party who also has an ethnic background but is a close personal associate of his that, on the basis of his experience in Victoria, this man is not only fit and yearning to be reappointed but also, in his opinion, the hardest working member on the tribunal in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to be too hard on Mr Clothier. I can understand his frustration and disappointment. I can understand a person who believes he has done a good job but is not being reappointed feeling bitter about the situation. I can understand it when he says, `This was a wrong decision in respect of me.' I am not prepared to say that, because of that frustration and disappointment, we should accept a series of accusations against other members of the tribunal with whom he worked. Why did he make these accusations? Because those members had a political association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I am disappointed. I say frankly, as someone who has spent not an inconsiderable period of my life in the courts and been involved in the legal process, that I would not hang a brown dog on Mr Clothier's evidence. I think I understand him and I feel for him, but I am not prepared to accept and convert some of his assertions into a principle in respect of these appointments. We are not talking about members of the judiciary. Of course, if a High Court judge, a supreme court judge, a county court judge or someone who is appointed to a judicial office want to hold that office it is appropriate that he resign his politic affiliation. I have no arguments with that. The honourable member for Berowra says that it is a terrible thing to appoint people who might have the same political affiliation as the minister. There are a minority of high court judges who did not have political affiliations. </PARA>

I do not remember Labor governments appointing to the High Court or senior court positions people who are active members of the Liberal Party or members of parliament. Let us not get too precious about the way in which senior members of the judiciary are appointed.

What we differ about is the way we achieve it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of the evidence that came before this committee, I am not prepared to say in relation to the Immigration Review Tribunal that, because a person has a commitment to a political philosophy and to changing society in the hope that he will improve it, in order to take up this five-year appointment which he is qualified for in every respect, he has to abandon his political beliefs and his commitment to the party of his choice. That is a nonsense proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, the test we should apply is: did the minister exceed the authority given to him by this parliament?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If honourable members opposite believe that changes have to be made, then it is a matter for this parliament to decide whether they are made.

They found at the end of day that they did not have any evidence upon which to act in that way. They have now confected a minority report which is not based on the evidence.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been waiting to speak on this bill for some hours, so it is with some shock that I finally get the call. It is interesting that we are discussing the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 at a time when we have very recently had a major report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues on the child support scheme tabled in the parliament. That report was an examination of the operation and effectiveness of the scheme. I offer my congratulations to the chairman of that committee, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), and to the members of his committee on having done not only a substantial and substantive piece of work, but one that is also really quite out standing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this is one of the most difficult and complex areas currently facing our society. The statistics are that something like 30 per cent of the population is currently getting divorced. I understand that by the year 2000 the figure will be nearer 40 per cent. With the majority of marriages producing children, quite clearly issues concerning child support are major to a large number of our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is with some regret that I say that I feel that if the minister responsible had been as diligent in his work in this area as the committee was in its report, frankly we could be a lot further down the track of solving some of the problems in this vexed area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like all members in this place, I get a phenomenal number of complaints about the Child Support Agency. I have been moved on more than one occasion to comment with increasing frustration that I think it is probably the worst government instrumentality invented by anybody anywhere in the world in the history of mankind. Perhaps that is going over the top, but it is not a very effective organisation. It is an interesting sidelight, perhaps, that the one thing a former husband and wife might agree on&mdash;they could be having World War III on all sorts of matters&mdash;is the incompetence and difficulties of the Child Support Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the problems come in two categories. One is with the basic administration&mdash;you do not really need a lot of legislation to fix that; we are talking about better management&mdash;and the other is problems with the act. That is where I would certainly like to have seen the minister act with somewhat more alacrity than we have seen in the amendments before us today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sorts of problems I have experienced, as have so many members in this place, are ones of contacting the Child Support Agency in the first place. Whether it is an individual or whether it is my office, you can phone up the Child Support Agency and you can wait. You can hang on and hang on and hang on. If, after 30 or 40 minutes&mdash;the phone may have dropped out several times and you have tried yet again&mdash;you eventually get somebody who has the decency to answer the phone, they will not give you their name, or they will give you a Christian name and nothing else. I am a member of parliament. I am not going to threaten their safety, but they will not tell me who I am speaking to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the person I have spoken to on the phone has promised to do something or take some action and I want to follow it up and I go back later on and say that I have spoken to John, Paul, Pete or whoever it is down there, the person at the office says, `We do not have anyone of that name.' You do not even know who you have been talking to and you cannot get any continuity. Quite often they will answer the phone and just go away and leave it off the hook and not come back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not an exaggeration. When my staff said to me in the early days of my being a member that this was the sort of thing happening with the Child Support Agency, frankly I did not believe them. So I started making some of these calls myself. In spite of all the protestations of the government, the agency has not improved in recent times one iota. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second problem we have is with delays in correspondence. It takes months, quite often, to get correspondence responded to by the Child Support Agency. Then what you get back invariably is inaccurate. It cannot get names, dates or other information right, or it loses documents. People send stuff in and after weeks of not getting any response they phone up and the people at the agency cannot find the documents. Or there may be arbitrary action. Something happens and the first you know is when your pay has been knocked off, or some other action has been taken and nobody has even bothered to tell you it was going to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many clients of the Child Support Agency it is a question of dealing in jargon. People do not understand the technical terms and the phraseology that is used at the different stages of the procedure. Then the privacy argument is used both ways. If you want some information you cannot be told because it is covered under the Privacy Act. But then somebody else is told information they should not have been told and the Privacy Act should have applied but it has not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are delays in payments and quite frequently the Child Support Agency will not act on information. An example of a problem is the situation of the man having a business of his own where his wages cannot be garnisheed and so on. You are trying to find out where he is or where his business is to get some information. The agency says that it cannot lay its hands on the information or find him. You identify where he is, where his business is or where he is earning his money. You phone up the agency and tell the people there and they refuse to take any action. They say, `We have not got time. We are too busy.' Or they say, `Yes, we'll do it tomorrow,' and three weeks later they still have not done a damn thing. So they do not act on information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that all those sorts of administrative problems are issues which are within the administrative competence of the minister and the department. I think, frankly, it is quite an appalling catalogue of irresponsibility that it has not been dealt with appropriately until now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are problems with the act itself&mdash;the way it is written and the particular rules that are applied. I know of one particular case of a man and woman who got divorced. They have three children. He has one of the children and the wife has two. His taxable income, allegedly, was lower than his wife's, although he was getting all sorts of additional benefits and his real income was significantly greater than that of the wife. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After having got divorced and having taken one child and two children respectively, they moved to new jobs. One partner relocated. The husband in fact took a nominally lower wage with lots of direct benefits which, of course, do not get counted. The wife took a lower wage. She was still getting, in real terms, less than the former husband. But we look at taxable income going back a couple of years. We cannot look at current income unless it is a drop of more than 15 per cent on the former income. Because we take only the taxable income and not all of the other benefits that are piled on the top&mdash;payment of mortgage, provision of a car and the paying of all the telephone bills, which come with many jobs and are real benefits to the person receiving those things&mdash;we have the ludicrous situation of the husband being able to claim child support maintenance from the wife, even though his income is greater than hers and he has one child and she has two. Frankly, I think it is not only nonsense but also against all forms of natural justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many men in this country who are in a much better organised lobby. Frequently they are the non-custodial parent. Many of those men genuinely suffer hardship as a result of the operations of the Child Support Agency and the maintenance which they have to pay. They are a well organised lobby, and there are many who have genuine hardship cases. Clearly, those issues have to be addressed. Again, from my experience, many more women as the custodial parents suffer far more greatly than many of those non-custodial men. Those women have to get on with it because they do not have the time, money and other resources to go to court and engage lawyers. They have to put food in the mouths of their children. It seems to me, therefore, that people on both sides of the argument are being ill-served. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say at this juncture that I do not think anybody in this House would object to the objectives of the Child Support Agency and what it is trying to do. The objection is about the way it operates. The problems are the way that the rules are written and have to be applied. If you have so many people suffering so much, it is incumbent upon the government to bring forward much more comprehensive legislation than the piece of legislation that we are debating tonight, which only skirts around the edge of the problems in two or three particular areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> One of the problems that have been demonstrated very aptly in the last couple of days when the report of the joint committee was discussed was that we do not have enough meaningful statistics on benefits, money, how much is spent and who gets it. It seems to me that one of the very urgent things that need to be done is to get much better quality information so that we do not have to deal with wild claims and all the emotionalism that tends to go on. We will not get the somewhat sad sights, where the minister stands up in this place and effectively attacks the chairman of his own committee and the chairman feels obliged to have a go at the minister because they cannot agree on the basic numbers. When we get to that stage, we have a fundamental problem of administration in this very place which goes to the heart of the notions of administration and legislation. If we cannot get the basics right here, what hope is there for the man and woman in the street?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, any decisions made by the Child Support Agency must reflect ultimately for the benefit and welfare of the children. It is a question of parents taking responsibility. We should be making assessments on the current situation. It is ludicrous to make assessments on income from two years ago. It is ludicrous to make assessments on income that is not the genuine income level at present. Clearly, we need to have quicker responses. If you have to feed three kids and your income is not very high, you need a response and some support quickly. You cannot afford to wait for months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CSA has to act upon information that it is given. There needs to be much more transparency in decision making. We need to introduce some case management so that we have some  continuity in the handling of cases. We have to make sure that in legislative terms we do not only look at salary and wage earners but also look at those who get the perks and those who run their own businesses. It seems to me that those people who run their own businesses are able to construct a financial portfolio or profile&mdash;whatever you want to call it&mdash;that enables them to avoid their responsibilities. My own view is that, if you do not pay for your children or provide support, you should not have the rights that you want to have in terms of the legalities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Of course there is a need for men who have been divorced and for women who have remarried to be able to rebuild their lives. I think it is often lost on people involved in these arguments, such as the parents of children, that just because people remarry, whatever the circumstances&mdash;whether they are marrying somebody with lots of money or not&mdash;it does not absolve them from the financial responsibility of their own children. Certainly, I do not think you can just pass it on to the state. I think that has to be made clear in any future legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that sort of background, what is the government doing? The Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 deals with a few peripheral issues. It deals with the subject of presumption of parentage, the child support agreements on Department of Social Security clients, periods of non-enforcement and extension of private payment arrangements. It seems to me that that is skirting around the subject. It does not go to the core of the issues that need to be addressed. That is why my colleague the honourable member for  Sturt (Mr Pyne) introduced the amendment earlier today on behalf of the coalition. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: "whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)its deleterious handling of the provision of child support maintenance for both custodial and non&mdash;custodial parents;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2)its continued failure to address the significant deficiencies of the operation of the Child Support Agency;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3)its prevarication in taking action to reform child support maintenance in this country to ensure it is fair and equitable to all parties".</PARA>
<PARA>The government cannot say that it did not know that the problems existed and that it had some valid reason for not bringing forward legislation. It did not have to wait for this massive tome. It has been there forever. Way back in 1991-92, the Commonwealth Ombudsman listed a number of complaints that he received. He talked about the communication difficulties, including the CSA's failure to respond to correspondence, the inadequacy of its telephone service, the lack of client focus, recovery of overpayments, imposition of late payment penalties problems, disputes over direct payments made to payees or third parties outside of their collection system, the collection of ongoing child support and the recovery of arrears. He was particularly critical of the communication difficulties that both clients of the CSA and the ombudsman's office had with the CSA. It is not just the man and woman in the street; the people who are used to using the bureaucratic system are the ones that are having problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act released a report in November 1992. Although an analysis of the child support scheme was not included in the committee's terms of reference, it felt obliged to comment on the scheme due to the large number of submissions, letters and phone calls it received about aspects of its operation. Then the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues had its famous hotline. One can only guesstimate the number of calls, but we were told that over 150,000 calls were made over a couple of days. That identified a number of issues raised by callers that the government surely should have been much more eager to deal with prior to today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The structure of the scheme and the operation of the formula were the main concerns of non-custodial parents. The standard of service from the CSA was criticised by both custodial and non-custodial parents. The different treatment of stage 1 and stage 2 clients was criticised by both sides of the argument. The committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is incumbent on the Parliament to recognise that there is considerable dissatisfaction, distress and hardship within the community about the program and the operation of the Child Support Agency. That dissatisfaction cannot be dismissed as merely a disgruntled minority.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee received over 6,000 submissions by June of this year. That was a record number for a parliamentary committee inquiry. With that welter of evidence over many years, what we have tonight is four little peripheral issues. I want to know why the minister is not doing something a damn sight more substantial about the whole exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we have got this huge report. The minister can react quickly because, obviously before he had time to read it, he was putting out press releases bucketing the chairman of the committee. The report contains 687 pages, with 163 recommendations. It is an all-party report; there is a minority report, but it really deals with one particular aspect of the matter and generally supports the majority report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has identified a number of things. It talks about the proportion of custodial parents not receiving payments. It talks about the different CSA offices having different administrative procedures. It talks about the CSA's practice of seizing funds without notice and says that this is against the principles of natural justice, and so on and so forth. It also provides a number of major recommendations. It asks that the legislation be rewritten in plain English, that there be a major overhaul of the CSA's operations. It suggests a number of other changes which I have not got time to go into tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, whilst we do not oppose the bill, we have an amendment to it. I believe that this legislation is only scratching the surface. The big job is still to come, and it is time that the government got on with it. All of us come into politics to try to improve our society. The minister has a major opportunity at this point in the country's history to actually bring in legislation to fix a major problem affecting Australian society, and he is missing his opportunity. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the member for Aston (Mr Nugent), we have been waiting a considerable time to debate the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. I support the bill and, despite the fact that I have a great deal of concern about aspects of the Child Support Agency and would agree, in general terms, with a number of statements made by the member for Aston, I do not believe it is appropriate that we accept the amendment moved by the member for Sturt (Mr Pyne). It is fairly typical of the sorts of amendments that the opposition brings into this House that do not forward the cause of legislation and that would be more relevant at another time&mdash;perhaps in an MPI or whatever else those opposite want to put forward. So I certainly do not support the general thrust of the amendment by the member for Sturt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will initially discuss the legislation and then I will turn my attention to aspects of the report of the parliamentary Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues that are very relevant to these discussions and which have been raised by the member for Aston. The first aspect of this bill with which I will deal relates to the presumption of parentage; it extends the basic presumptions of parentage to align them more closely with the Family Law Act of 1975. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will provide the following specific changes. It will allow the registrar to be satisfied that a man is a parent of a child where that child was born to a woman married to that man within 10 months after their marriage has been annulled; or that child was born to a woman who was married to that man, separated from him, resumed cohabitation for not more than three months and separated again; or that child was born within 10 months after cohabitation ended and after the dissolution of their marriage; or that child was born to a woman who cohabited with that man for a period of at least six months, and this period included the time 10 months before the birth. All this sounds amazing and, I am sure, suggests some wildly fluctuating scenarios. But it certainly will assist in the ease with which parentage can be registered and effectively allow custodial parents to claim child support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second aspect in the bill which I will address relates to child support agreements for Department of Social Security clients. The bill requires that child support agreements entered into by Department of Social Security clients do meet reasonable actions for maintenance provisions under the Social Security Act 1991. As a member of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, it is of some surprise to me that the Department of Social Security has indicated that 80 per cent of agreements registered with the Child Support Agency are for amounts less than formula assessment; that, on average, these agreements are 50 per cent less than formula assessment. I know of very few where that has been tolerated at all. However, it is important that non-custodial parents meet their responsibilities to provide for their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to note from the press release of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) that parents will remain free to negotiate agreements that contain a mixture of periodic, non-periodic and capitalised maintenance. However, if the custodial parent is receiving an income tested pension, benefit or allowance, the combined value of cash and non-cash components in the agreement must provide adequate levels of child support. I do not have any argument with that. I will refer to the formula later in my remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third aspect of this bill which I will address relates to the enforcement of certain maintenance liabilities for stage 1 parents. This will enable the registrar to respond to certain changed circumstances of non-custodial parents without requiring the parties to return to the court. This is a very important issue and certainly will go some way to meet the concerns outlined in Senator Belinda Neal's dissenting report. In her dissenting report, Senator Neal stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I must begin this report by stating quite clearly that, even though there are some issues in the Joint Committee report that I cannot agree with, I believe that the majority of the matters raised and the recommendations set out within that report will be of great benefit to the Child Support Scheme and to those whose lives are affected by the operation of the Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>It was one of Senator Neal's recommendations that the Child Support Assessment Act 1989 should be extended to all children of separated parents, that is, to bring stage one into the stage two area of the scheme. The joint select committee debated and discussed this issue long and hard but, given that the retrospectivity of such a situation would create massive difficulties&mdash;particularly where property settlements were made&mdash;the joint select committee could not agree to make what would be a major and very radical change to the scheme. However, while the member for Aston may feel that these changes are peripheral, I believe that this issue will allow for real benefit to stage one parties to avoid the cost and difficulty of returning to court to get some changes to their obligations, and it particularly refers to two areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When a non-custodial parent's income is not more than the maximum rate of single pension and that person is in receipt of an income tested pension, benefit or allowance, in practice this will usually be when the non-custodial parent is unemployed or unable to be employed through, for example, a serious illness and, secondly, when the child has left the ongoing care of the custodial parent. This is going to be very important because it will allow the registrar to make a decision that the child support does not have to be collected without the court making a determination. However, it does not mean that, if those circumstances change, either party will not be able to go back to court. I believe this is an example of the minister being prepared to be flexible in an ongoing way to make changes to the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the joint select committee would not expect that the Assistant Treasurer would be able to bring in a bill that would entirely respond to all the 163 recommendations in the committee's report two or three days after it has been tabled in the House. So I believe this is a matter that will meet at least one of Senator Neal's concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth area of the bill presently before us relates to the extension of private payment arrangements and will allow Department of Social Security clients who have been receiving payments via the Child Support Agency to enter into private arrangements. This is a very important amendment to the main Child Support Agency bills because under current arrangements when a custodial parent applies to Social Security for income support he or she must decide whether to have the non-custodial parent pay privately or whether to have the Child Support Agency collect the money. Once the custodial parent decides, for instance, to have the Child Support Agency undertake the collection, there is no future possibility of a change of mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly in many cases in the early stages once a marriage has broken down there is a huge amount of trauma and conflict between the parents. Very often the custodial parent, as they are still called, sees the Child Support Agency in a sense as a haven and a refuge so they will not have to deal directly with the non-custodial parent and they will avoid the kinds of difficulties they fear. So they opt for a collection through the CSA. Ultimately this can become onerous to both the custodial and the non-custodial parent and many custodial parents later find that payment would be faster if their former partners were allowed to pay directly. Certainly non-custodial parents complain that their privacy is invaded by having their employer deduct child support when they are quite willing and able and prepared to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also creates a fair deal of aggravation for non-custodial parents who feel not only that in regard to many of their rights as non-custodial parents to have access to their children and be involved in their children's welfare many difficulties are put in their path, but that also once again a bureaucratic government agency is imposing on their parental responsibilities. I believe that this amendment will make a considerable difference in this area and goes to the heart of one of the numerous recommendations in our report. I refer to paragraph 153 of our report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The joint committee considers that a large proportion of those parents who voluntarily pay child support to the Child Support Agency on time could be safely moved off CSA collection. This could be achieved by giving the Child Support Registrar the discretion to substitute private collection for CSA collection where a reliable parent has established a reliable voluntary payment record of six months. However, there will be some special cases, such as those involving duress or domestic violence, where private collection will not be appropriate. The joint committee considers that in order to encourage private collection and minimise the CSA's collection costs, the Child Support Registrar should ordinarily exercise his discretion to substitute private collections for CSA collection except where the special circumstances of the case require.</PARA>
<PARA>I note that we have not been gender non-specific here. I will have to raise that with the chair. We have obviously missed that one in our many long discussions on this report. Recommendation 69 states the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The joint committee recommends that the child support legislation be amended to give the Child Support Registrar the discretion to substitute private collection for Child Support Agency collection where a reliable parent has established a reliable voluntary payment record of six months.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 70 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The joint committee recommends that the Child Support Registrar's discretion to substitute private collection for Child Support Agency collection be ordinarily exercised in favour of private collection except where the special circumstances of the case require otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Here is an example, I am delighted to say, of where the Assistant Treasurer has picked up on evidence given to the committee over a period of 18 months and responded to it. We feel that where we can move as many collections as possible out of the system for the Child Support Agency it will free up the system so that the agency can then concentrate on the difficult areas and the areas that were referred to by the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent). So here is an example of where the minister concerned has responded to the joint select committee. I hope this will be not be the only area where the minister picks up on our recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to move from specific discussion of the bill at hand to the reform package that we have tabled and the report that the member for Chifley (Mr Price), the chair of our committee, tabled in the House on Monday. In the report that we have tabled it was a challenge for the committee to bring a balance between the issues of justice and equity for the families of both custodial and non-custodial parents, between the children of first and subsequent families and between parents and taxpayers generally. The balance points are complex in both social and economic terms and are affected by the interaction of the taxation, social security, family law and child support systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the committee's 163 recommendations provide the basis of a powerful reform package. Therefore, with other members of the committee, I feel somewhat disappointed at the early response from the Assistant Treasurer and the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) because I do not believe they have had a chance to look at the recommendations as a package. I am sure every member of the joint select committee hopes that, irrespective of the early criticisms that have been made of our recommendations, the ministers will have another and a longer look. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been an all-party committee of both houses of the parliament. Speaking as one member who put a lot of effort into the public hearings, I do not believe that the 6,000-odd people who put in submissions, many of whom travelled long distances to personally attend public hearings, are just a disgruntled minority. It was very easy to pick up on the disgruntled few, particularly non-custodial parents who wanted to continue the fight and the war with their ex-partners and who were using the child support arrangements to do it. I believe we were able to clarify those difficulties. Certainly the ministers have not picked up on the substantial number of suggestions we have put forward in terms of those non-custodial parents who are self-employed. I refer to our recommendations in this regard. We said in paragraph 265 of our report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The submissions received by the joint committee in respect of the current child support income base generally complained that self-employed non-custodial parents can easily avoid child support obligations. The CSA was not able to advise the joint committee of the actual number of self-employed parents, that is, parents in receipt of business or investment income under the scheme. Nor was the CSA able to indicate the overall extent to which these parents are avoiding or minimising their child support liabilities. The joint committee considers that the CSA should undertake research to identify the precise number of parents under the scheme who receive income from business structures and the extent of the child support minimisation by these parents. Only then will the CSA be in a position to develop strategies which can efficiently respond to child support minimisation by parents who receive business and investment income.  </PARA>
<PARA>We made a range of recommendations about self-employed parents because they are the group about whom many custodial parents have complained long and hard, not only to every member of this House, but also to the committee, because those parents must meet their child support obligations. Where we have suggested changes to the formula they have been quite marginal. We have not walked away from the core responsibilities with which we agree with the Minister for Social Security and the Assistant Treasurer. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

As my colleague the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) has indicated, we do not oppose the amendments to the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues has recently handed down its report. Once the government has digested that report and once it has sorted out the very many arguments that will emanate from that report, we may well see further amending legislation in the House in this subject area and we will be back to debate it yet again. I also support the amendment moved by my colleague the honourable member for Sturt which states:</PARA>

<PARA>The amendments the government is proposing to introduce into this House will not be opposed by the opposition. Indeed, those amendments were outlined by my colleague the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) when he spoke just a little while ago. We ought to appreciate that the amendments are too little too late and are, in fact, only cosmetic changes to a government agency which is undoubtedly one of the most despised bureaucracies in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the joint committee says that the child support scheme has been a qualified success, the simple fact is I receive hundreds of complaints every year from constituents in relation to the Child Support Agency and I know my colleague and good friend the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) also receives hundreds of complaints. I challenge any member in this place to say that the Child Support Agency is not one of the major areas of difficulty for the people of Australia. The fact that so many people complain indicates that the Child Support Agency is in a total state of disarray. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this committee called for submissions, over 6,000 submission were received&mdash;a record, I understand, for submissions to a government committee. The committee also had a phone-in and 150,000 Australians found it necessary to express their concerns in relation to the Child Support Agency. I commend that committee on taking into account the consideration of so many of our fellow citizens. Clearly, when you look at the report handed down, you see it is widely accepted that there is a very large number of problems in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amongst the recommendations of the report is the recognition that a significant proportion of custodial parents are not receiving payments and $481.5 million is actually owed to the CSA. It takes an average of 142 days, 20 weeks, from the start of liability for custodians to receive the first child support payment. How on earth can that be justified in this day and age? We also find that different CSA officers have followed different administrative procedures. Can you believe this in 1994? The Child Support Agency's practice of seizing funds without notice is against the principles of natural justice. CSA staff do not understand privacy arrangements and have disclosed personal information. That is an absolute disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CSA staff have refused to give reasons for decisions, have been rude and unhelpful, have made personal judgments about clients and comments like, `You'd be better off on the dole.' What absolute contempt. I do not think anyone in this House would endorse those kinds of sentiments being expressed towards people who are going through a very difficult period in their life. The CSA has not automatically provided clients with information on their rights and obligations under the child support legislation. The system for reviewing decisions causes uncertainty and a lack of confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a total of 163 recommendations. We notice that the government is already squabbling over what it is going to do in relation to this report. I hope the government and the ministers look seriously at this report and take into account some of the matters raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The joint committee report is not the only damning indictment which exists on the record of the Child Support Agency. The recently released ombudsman's annual report has shown that the Child Support Agency is generating a disproportionate amount of complaints. This report lists the top three sources of complaints to the ombudsman as: Social Security with 3,403 cases; the Child Support Agency with 2,452 cases; and Telecom with 2,361 cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This might look fine on the surface, but one ought to appreciate that Social Security has about five million clients&mdash;an indictment in itself, given the extent of problems in Australia today&mdash;and that Telecom has 8.5 million subscribers, while at the moment the Child Support Agency has fewer than 300,000 active cases. A close analysis of these figures shows that one in every 100 people dealing with the CSA has felt obliged to turn to the ombudsman to solve problems. This number has increased by 13 per cent in just 12 months. If one in 100 goes to the ombudsman, then many others seek redress in other ways. Given the hundreds of complaints that I receive and the hundreds of complaints that every one of the other 146 members of this House receive, it is pretty clear that there is a monumental problem with the Child Support Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although sadly divorces today are becoming more common, the breakdown of marriage is a time of hardship and emotional trauma for all those involved. The large number of divorces in this country should make us appreciate that government bodies, when dealing with people going through this difficult time in their lives, ought to treat them kindly and in a very humane manner. It is therefore very personally upsetting to me to hear of so many complaints about the Child Support Agency from people who are normally suffering enough stress from the trauma associated with their marriage breakdowns. The added stress associated with the CSA is beyond the pale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who come to see me and sometimes bring files of their dealings with the Child Support Agency which are six inches thick. The inefficiency, the bureaucracy and the monumental contempt the Child Support Agency shows to ordinary Australians has meant that an ever-increasing number of our citizens have their dealings with the Child Support Agency as virtually the dominant factor in their lives. They worry about the Child Support Agency and, in effect, they find that it tends to prevent their getting on with their lives and putting their lives together. As was noted in the joint committee report, a major problem with the present system is the variation of administration procedures among CSA offices and the failure of those offices to enforce orders made by the Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There must be something dramatically wrong with an operation which no-one is pleased with. Custodial parents feel that they are treated with contempt, that they are spoken down to, that their problems are ignored, that their legal rights are overlooked. Non-custodial parents feel that they are being hounded, persecuted and victimised. You will find that anyone who has dealings with the Child Support Agency, in effect, makes a complaint. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many couples whose marriages break down try, for the sake of the children, to maintain some kind of ongoing sensible relationship so that they are able to help bring their children up together. They might not be living together, but they are prepared to work together to make sure that their children get the best possible upbringing. I have had quite a large number of those people come to me and say that any residual relationship that existed between them has been exploded by the Child Support Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to outline one particular case where the wife was absolutely desperate; she was destitute. She was not receiving the child support that she was supposed to receive, so she contacted the Child Support Agency&mdash;not once, not twice, but 25 times. She never got a phone call back. She never got a letter. The Child Support Agency finally spoke to her and said, `Your ex-husband hasn't paid the money.' I will not use the term that she used to describe her husband; it would not be parliamentary. But, obviously, from that moment on she did not trust him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ex-husband came to see me afterwards and said, `Look, these are the receipts.' The agency had taken $7,000 away from him by way of child support payments and somehow lost that money in the system. He paid it; the Child Support Agency got it and somewhere lost it within the labyrinth of the agency's offices throughout Australia and it did not emerge out the other end. On the one hand, you had a woman who was destitute. On the other hand, you had a father, in this case, who had made the payments and the Child Support Agency was sitting on the money. There is something basically, radically and totally wrong with any government institution that can operate in such a way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People tell me that they get three and four letters in the space of two or three days from the Child Support Agency. I can tell from the way you are nodding, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the problems I am outlining are the sorts of problems that you know of through your electorate office as well. A person opens the mail and gets a letter from the Child Support Agency which says that a certain amount has been paid or that a certain amount is owing. The next day the postman delivers another letter setting out that different moneys are owing or that different moneys have been paid. Forms are issued and posted to clients which are absolute gobbledegook. You find that there are miscellaneous debits and credits that can never be tracked through the system. People ring the Child Support Agency and receive no reasonable response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The plight of second families has not been adequately addressed. I agree with colleagues on both sides of the chamber who have said that, even when a marriage breaks down, it is very important that ongoing responsibilities are met and that, if a person has fathered or mothered a child, then that child is entitled to support whether or not the father or mother has entered into another relationship or has married. But I have had numerous complaints telling me that when children are born into a second marriage there is not enough money left to maintain the second family in any reasonable way. I think that has to be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A constituent recently contacted my office and advised me that she had received a communication from the Child Support Agency outlining that she was obliged to forward documents, such as bank statements, to the agency at the request of her husband, who had enacted review procedures. I will call this lady Mrs X for the reasons of confidentiality. I do not want her to be persecuted further by the Child Support Agency. She already has been. If I mentioned her name here, then the Child Support Agency would probably be on her doorstep persecuting her and treating her with even greater contempt than it has already. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before complying with the order, she understandably sought legal advice and was told by her solicitor that there was no obligation for her to comply with the order unless her income was over $38,000. Her solicitor then went on to say, `But if you want to win, you have to abide by the Child Support Agency's own rules.' Can you believe that? This body is running amuck, treating people with contempt, writing its own rules and, in effect, tearing up the common law of this country, which ought to govern the actions of all of us. It is through these inconsistencies and this kind of approach that people have come to the view that the Child Support Agency is flawed and full of grave injustices and uncertainties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many other sentiments about the Child Support Agency have been expressed to me. I can honestly say that I have not had one person come to me and say that the Child Support Agency has done the right thing. I have had another instance where someone said that it took 18 weeks from the time the money was deducted from her husband's income until she received it. In 1994, almost 1995, how can one justify that it would take 18 weeks from the time it was taken out of the pay until it was received by the custodial parent? At the very least, one has to say that there is gross inefficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Child Support Agency has failed to enforce maintenance payments of supporting parents who had absconded, defaulted or were incapable of meeting the financial commitments set by the agency. The fact is that a lack of consistency in the CSA enforcement procedures for maintenance payments has meant that in some cases tens of thousands of dollars have been spent on obtaining court orders which, to quote one of my constituents, once obtained were `not worth the paper it was written on'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this particular case, the lady was told that, despite the fact she had spent $18,000 in court costs to obtain a number of court orders, she could not use them. It is not surprising, therefore, that the committee report found that a significant proportion of custodial parents were not receiving payments and that $481.5 million is owed to the CSA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the CSA's failure to make effective use of the full range of its enforcement powers and the inconsistency in its approach to the use of these powers was also noted by the joint committee. I note from the report that the Family Court of Australia has submitted that there was a need for the CSA to provide more training to staff in the use of the court system in Australia and to establish consistent criteria so that appropriate enforcement action is taken in each case. From the letters I have received, this training is clearly overdue. However, that training will not make up for the endless hours of hardship which thousands of people have encountered as a result of the fundamental flaws in the current system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another complaint I received was from a person who paid some $4,500 to his wife and family in excess of his obligations under the child support arrangements. But, because he had retrospectively made that payment, the Child Support Agency refused to accept that the money had indeed been paid, with the result that the agency was hounding him for an amount which of course he no longer had. That constituent said, `I've no objection to paying for the support of my children, but these back payments are totally unjust.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have received numerous complaints from people who have been treated inadequately by the Child Support Agency. A few months ago I received such a complaint from a constituent in the electorate of Fisher. The agency has made mistakes in assessing the amounts of child support payable by many parents and, consequently, these people have had to reorganise their own budgets. Some parents have found that they have had to pay more than was originally instructed by the Child Support Agency. This bureaucratic bungle ought not to have happened; people ought to be entitled to plan their affairs in accordance with the information given to them by the Child Support Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, we have a situation where the government has now brought into the parliament a bill which includes a few fiddling amendments. I think it has been described as `too little, too late'. It certainly is an inadequate bill. It is a bill that has come in at about the same time as the report has been handed down&mdash;the report, which is a damning report with 163 recommendations. The government I think would have been well advised to possibly take on board the terms of that report and then to have brought in a consolidated bill which would have dealt with all of the changes that are required in the area of child support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting, however&mdash;and I mentioned this briefly earlier&mdash;that a full-scale brawl has now broken out between the chairman, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), and two ministers over the committee's report on the Child Support Agency. These ministers have savaged the report. I think it is disgusting that they have savaged a report on the instructions of their departments, when that report really was produced as a result of over 6,000 written submissions and some 150,000 phone calls. So these concerns of people right across Australia have been wiped away by these two ministers who have backed up their department and who are, in effect, defending the indefensible. I think that is appalling. I certainly hope that the chairman, the honourable member for Chifley, is able to take this matter on board with a view to rolling these ministers so that we can have the changes to the Child Support Agency which are much needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, it is pretty clear that the Child Support Agency is an organisation which pleases no-one. Custodial parents are unhappy; non-custodial parents are unhappy. Gross bureaucratic bungles appear to occur by the day. In fact, the Child Support Agency is destroying the lives of an increasing number of Australians. Quite frankly, I think the government ought to be condemned, in effect, for not bringing in the major changes necessary. The Child Support Agency is a rotten agency&mdash;it is rotten to the core. It is important that people look after and maintain their children. But we ought to have a system which is fair, reasonable and equitable, a system that treats ordinary citizens as though they are human beings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak on the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. Firstly, I thank all honourable members who have spoken so kindly of the work of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues in its tabling of its recent report into the child support scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose we should go back a little time in history to when the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) first announced this proposed change to legislation. I found it ironic that the media were contacting me and saying, `Isn't it dreadful that the minister seems to be pre-empting the committee? Aren't you offended? Haven't you got something to say?' Of course, I did have something to say. I had to say that I was very pleased that the Assistant Treasurer was announcing these changes, and that, no, I did not see him as pre-empting the report but that I felt this to be the first instalment of changes that would be received by clients of the agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I feel it is a little ironic that we have an opposition amendment which is very critical of the government and the Assistant Treasurer for not going further, particularly given that at the time he said&mdash;and I thank him for this&mdash;he was awaiting the report of the committee before making any further changes. So the opposition amendment is critical of the government for not going further. However, at the time these changes were announced, people, particularly commentators in the media who were following child support, felt they were pre-empting the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the role of oppositions in this House is difficult, although generally members on both sides of the House seem to see the issues very much in a bipartisan way. However, I would say genuinely to all members of the House that, rather than going through the entrails of the past, I think what is really important is that we form a view about the recommendations. I welcome all members in this House, both from this, the government, side and that of the opposition, seeking to work constructively to persuade the ministers of the importance of introducing this reform package. I think that is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand where the amendment is coming from, but I am not particularly anxious to support it. This issue is unfortunate in a way because I believe that the whole child support area has been treated very much in a bipartisan way by the overwhelming majority of members of this House. It has shown that, when important issues start to bite, the best is brought out in all members and senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested by a couple of members that there is a sort of war breaking out between the ministers and me. That is not true. But I have said&mdash;and I am not ashamed to repeat it&mdash;I am disappointed at their initial reaction. However, that is not the main game. The main game is what they will do with the 163 recommendations, not their knee-jerk reaction to one or two. I am a long-term player in this game, so that does not phase me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do feel that I need to correct something I have said in this House, and this is the first available opportunity I have had to do so&mdash;and I apologise to the House. Firstly, the committee in its report suggested that default assessments were not being included in the collection rate. We were absolutely correct in that assertion&mdash;right up until 1 July this year. I regret to say that I and the other members of the committee were totally unaware that that had changed. I do not recall the minister advising the House of it; I do not recall a press release; in fact, I do not even recall the CSA informing the public of it. I think that is the reason for that new figure of 68 per cent, because it reflects this change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not really think the minister has pinged me on that at all, but it does appear that we were in error about private collections being included. In fact, my understanding at this point is that they are not included. But that does highlight, I think, that you can spend vast amounts of time with there still being great confusion about different figures of debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Auditor-General was critical of that issue, I would join constructively in that. I am aware that the agency is conscious of it, and I am sure it is going to do something constructive about it. I was wrong in that, and I have always found in life that you are better squaring off and saying you are wrong. Of all the other criticisms the ministers have made, I have to say that I got four out of five and they got one out of five. I would have thought that is not a bad batting average. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have never thought the important thing about the collection rate was the actual percentage at the moment&mdash;whether it is what we say it is, whether it is 68 per cent or whether it is 75 per cent. To me that was never the critical issue, and if you read the report you will see that. The critical issue is the fact that it is not in the high 90s. That is what the committee has been most concerned about and is what we need to focus our attention on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am in that vein, I congratulate Michael Carmody on his press statement about the report. CSA accepts the challenge, which, I have to say, comes as no surprise to me at all. As I have said a number of times in this place, and to groups I have addressed and to a lot of the media, CSA is already on the reform path. It has bitten the reform bullet and, if I can use another cliche, is on the reform escalator. That is good news. I do not think it can get off, which is also good news. The committee has set very high standards for the CSA which will be very challenging. I am sure the CSA will relish the exercise of trying to meet those very high standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of criticisms in the ministerial press release I want to go over again because, I regret to say, they are being repeated. The first is the criticism that non-custodial parents earning over $65,500 a year would benefit most. I really find it very disappointing that the Department of Social Security is running with this line. It knows very well that the original proposal was that it would be set at that level and that the figure of 2 1/2 times average weekly earnings was set by the ministerial committee only because of a concern about custodial parents having to apply to the Family Court for a departure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that they no longer have to apply, because of early initiatives to introduce child support review offices, it is absolutely scandalous that the department would peddle the line that returning to the original designs of the scheme, which it had fully endorsed and advised ministers on, would somehow be a dreadful mistake and that the committee is erring and singling out non-custodial parents to benefit most. I am very disappointed, as is the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Referring to further modifications in the formula, the majority of custodial parents and their children would achieve less assistance. Why can people not look at the enforcement side, which clearly will mean that many custodial parents and their children who currently receive not one dollar will receive some money. Why can they not pick on the fact that the committee took the principle that even where people are unemployed that is not a terminating event and not an abrogation of responsibility. Even though the amount is modest, they would be paying a minimum of $260 a year. I admit that it is not much assistance to custodial parents and their children, but this is a whole new group of custodial parents and children who would benefit from the recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is a knee-jerk reaction. Again, by these formula modifications, there will be a perception of greater fairness and equity in the scheme, which a lot of people feel is not there now. Apart from all the enforcement procedures we are recommending, I believe there will be a greater level of voluntary compliance, again with custodial parents and their children benefiting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not mentioned in the ministerial statement but it was mentioned on radio that somehow we have created a huge work disincentive by dropping that disregarded income level for custodial parents from $34,000 down to $19,000. There can be work disincentives on both sides of the equation, both for custodial parents and for non-custodial parents. If we are going to be genuine, and as the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) reminds me, we ought not to be gender specific but we ought to rail against disincentives wherever they occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most mischievous point about that is that 91 per cent of all custodial parents currently in the scheme are absolutely unaffected by the change; only nine per cent are affected by the change. It is very mischievous of people to try to highlight that as some vicious attempt to create work disincentive hurdles for custodial parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise that this is a package. All members of this House, on both sides of politics, have a job in front of them if they want to see these recommendations implemented. I certainly am looking forward to a dispassionate, calm and, hopefully, rational consideration by the ministers. Should they so desire, I look forward to working through the report recommendations with them and telling them where the committee was coming from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to do something a little personal. Family law was completely new to me when I became chairman of the committee. It has been a difficult area for me. As soon as it became public knowledge that we had this child support reference, a person in my electorate&mdash;whom I am going to call Alice, which is not her real name&mdash;was in a second family situation. It was her second marriage and it was his second marriage. She rang me from the club and was very excited about it. She was an office holder of one of the organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alice asked me if she could come and talk to me about the report to try to gain my views on it and I said that of course she could. I must say that Alice was always very supportive during the inquiry. I am sad to say that the report came out and Alice's husband committed suicide. I suppose one of the most stressful things during the report was that I had alluded to the fact that non-custodial parents were suiciding. Quite a bit of pressure was put on me because it was said that I was undermining the credibility of the scheme and that, as a result of my comments, non-custodial parents would refuse to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sad again to report a situation in Darwin. We actually did not have anecdotal evidence of a suicide. We had the de facto partner of someone. The child support scheme is not the sole reason, but it constitutes a significant reason why, I regret to say, some people have contemplated and committed suicide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very sorry for Alice and her husband that this occurred. If I could dedicate the report to anyone, I would dedicate it to Alice. I sincerely hope that she has an opportunity&mdash;I know she will&mdash;to read the report. I hope she will see that there is a lot of light at the end of the tunnel for a lot of people who have thought they were in a hole, were desperate and had nowhere to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said to the House previously that we had an inquiry into the funding and administration of the Family Court, and we will get stuck into that in the new year. I am pleased to say that we have the full support of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch). He has been urging us on for some time. I say to members of this House that I think it is unfortunate that in the International Year of the Family we do not have a reference that looks at the community sector and what can be done not at the collateral end of relationships, as the previous committee inquiry did and as this inquiry did, but to strengthen families and relationships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am profoundly of the view that there is a lot we can do to change community attitudes and to provide access to services. I am not saying that we will save every relationship or every marriage, but at least we will save some, particularly in the longer term. For every one that we save, that is great. At least we made the effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the committee does not have that reference. I think it is really sad that on the second last day of this sitting in the International Year of the Family we do not have that reference. If it were possible to get the reference, I certainly would welcome it. I could assure you that the members of the committee would make a first-class job of it. </PARA>

It clearly indicated that the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) really felt some of the pain of the people who were coming to him. I want to pay a very great tribute to the previous speaker, the Chairman of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. He has tried very hard and shown great courage. It is extremely rare for members of the government and, I regret to say, the opposition to stand against the frontbench, in spite of the fact that the frontbench makes some dreadful mistakes, as it has in the case of this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I intend to be very specific this evening. I believe that, if you are going to make a case, you should make it with the hardest of evidence possible. On each occasion that I have made claims in this place I have been proved exactly correct on every detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, this evening I have the hardest of hard evidence. I have in my hand a pay slip which indicates that this particular employee works in the surface workshops department. The pay slip is dated the fortnight ended 4 September 1994. The employer is Mount Isa Mines Limited and Mount Isa Mines Operations. I have whited out the name and pay number of the employee. His classification is a diesel fitter. His income tax payable for the fortnight to which this pay slip refers is $301. His child support payment is $267. His phone calls are $4. His superannuation is $37. His guard set&mdash;whatever that is&mdash;is 50c. His National Mutual deductions are $32. His MEWU fees&mdash;that is, his union dues&mdash;are $8. His ambulance payment is $2.60. The rest of his pay&mdash;$240&mdash;goes into his savings account with the Queensland Country Credit Union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His income for that fortnight was $1,266, quite a reasonable income. His total deductions were $893. That left him with a disposable income of $613 for the fortnight, which is $307 a week. He has health fund payments&mdash;his medical benefits, if you like&mdash;of $17, and that covers his kids as well as himself. He has tried to keep them going because he wants to look after his kids and see that they have medical benefits available to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His wife shot through and went to live on the coast at Maryborough, Hervey Bay or the Sunshine Coast&mdash;some place like that&mdash;which is about 1,600 road kilometres from Mount Isa. If he sees his kids twice a year, he has to save $54 a week in order to go down there, stay there and come back. That is a pretty reasonable figure. Like most people who have come into my office, and I suspect everybody's office, he has legal debts hanging over from his divorce. He is paying $44 on a weekly basis because he borrowed money to pay the legal debts. So those three deductions&mdash;travel to see his children, repayments of his legal debts for the divorce and his health fund payments&mdash;total $115 a week. That leaves him with $182 a week to live off in Mount Isa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has to get to work. There is no commuter transportation system in Mount Isa. The ground temperature reaches close to 200 degrees fahrenheit in Mount Isa in mid-summer. It is pretty hard to walk to work because the mine is some distance from the town. The best he could do was a second-hand motor scooter, but that still costs him about $35 a week in costs. His rent is $85 a week. That leaves him with the princely sum of $62 a week for food, clothing, razor blades, soap, medication and letters and phone calls to the kids. How you can possibly live and stay alive on $62 a week is incredible to me. This is an ordinary, typical case. We have some 30-odd cases that are almost identical to this on our books in our offices in Innisfail and Mount Isa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is not typical is a bad case. It is an ordinary case when the bloke is trying to live off $182 a week. I would assume that other people have cases of an extraordinary nature. Once again I turn to a pay slip. I have two of them, but I will read only one of them out to the House. It is from the Queensland Railways. Every fortnight the person pays $235 in income tax; $28 for his quarters&mdash;we will include that in his income&mdash;$200 to his bank, the Queensland Credit Union; $74 to his medical benefits fund; $45 to his Queensland government superannuation, which is compulsory at his workplace; $1.50 to the QRI; $488 in child support payments; $6 to the Australian Railways Union; and $43 to National Mutual Life, which is also part of his income. That creates for him an income of $1,127 gross a fortnight. After those deductions, we find him left with $116 a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also has to repay a legal debt for a divorce, which is $54 a week. So that leaves this person $62 a week to live off. In this case, he has to pay for accommodation, food, clothing, razor blades, soap and medication. He has $62 a week to do this. It creates some difficulties for me, as a rational person, to get a letter back from the head of the department after I had discussed the matter with her in great detail. I hope and pray that she was not really a party to the letter. The letter says that the department sees nothing in the cases I raised that would lead it to believe that there should be any change in the legislation. In other words, the department thinks that it is quite acceptable for a person to try to stay alive on $62 a week. Let me bring the message home. It is horrific that a government department would accept that it is quite acceptable that a person should be asked to live off $62 a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case, the wife shot through. I am told she has quite a good job as a law clerk. She is on some $20,000-plus a year. Her husband is a practising lawyer with a reasonable sort of firm in a provincial town. Presumably, he is on some $45,000 a year. So that is $65,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then they get another $12,000 off this poor beggar who is left to live on $62 a week. This woman who shot through on her husband and took the kids with her, leaving this fellow who is totally innocent with no family, is living on a household income of $77,000 a year. Can it be that we live in a society that accepts that a human being in Australia today can live on $62 a week? Can it be that we get a letter from the head of the department stating that there is nothing wrong with the situation? We could even take the average case where a person has to live off $182 a week in a place such as Mount Isa. It may be difficult to live anywhere on $182 a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has to be something behind such a situation. It seems to me that we have a policy which is being driven by the feminazis, as the radio commentators call them. It is hard to find any other explanation for what can only be described as vicious oppression of a class of people. The honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) said earlier this evening in this debate that there had been an extraordinary number of complaints against this operation, both from the ombudsman and those members of this place that take any notice of the people who walk through their doors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the member for Chifley and chairman of the committee, spoke about a suicide. We had a case in Mount Isa where a person had to stay alive on this sort of money. Members have to understand what is going on in this human being's mind. His wife has shot through on him and left him. This in itself has a shattering effect on any human being. Certainly the people I know who have gone through divorces say that that is the case. To lose your children as well magnifies the psychological problems that are created by the situation. Then they are left not only with no money now but also no money for the rest of their adult lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If they have young children, they have to keep paying for the next 15, 17 or 20 years of their lives. Unfortunately, in most of the cases I know of, young children have been involved so these people are looking down the barrel of a gun and this situation prevailing for the next 20 years. They have no money to take girls out and therefore do not have the opportunity to get married again. They have no savings, so they do not have the ability to better or improve their lot. They can hope for nothing better than what they have got. They have no money to be able to undertake courses of study to improve their income and they are deprived of the comfort of their wife and children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had three cases of suicide in Mount Isa alone. The last one was a nice young man. He cried with his mates when he told them what was happening to him. He went to his parents house in Cairns, bought some rope, tied it on to a tree in the backyard, stood on a chair, kicked the chair out from under him and died. We can clearly understand this suicide because not only had this man lost everything; he had also been condemned to a life of grinding, unbelievable poverty. I will give the Child Support Agency one thing: it has created an effective situation where people will pay. There is no way a person will get out of paying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst campaigning before I became a member of parliament, one day in one hotel I met two people who were very much inebriated. A young bloke who was with one of them said, `Just ignore what he is saying. He has been this way for sometime. This is the Child Support Agency thing.' He explained to me that these men had everything taken off them. These men had improved their income and position. If a person is on the dole and has a limited amount of money, they will get rental assistance. A person in Mount Isa will be significantly better off on the dole, so they go on the dole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who work at Mount Isa mines are hardworking men. A person could not do a hard day's work at a mine unless they were a hardworking sort of person. Their lives have been ruined and they have nothing to look forward to. They are not slowly drinking themselves to death but speedily drinking themselves into an early grave. This is being paid for by the taxpayers. This is a great achievement of the Child Support Agency. It says that it sees no evidence that warrants any change in the act even though a person is trying to live off $62 a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will outline to the House two other cases that are of interest. One involves a young man who had worked very hard, completed his apprenticeship and had purchased two houses. That is quite a feat at 22 years of age. He had a car that he owed no money on. He was a hardworking achiever. He was a good looking fellow who did some male modelling. He was a good style of bloke in every respect. He also went to church. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His wife decided one evening that she would go to the disco instead of coming home. Then she decided to do that on a fairly regular basis. For the sake of their son, which this young man loved very much, he endured this situation for some time. Eventually he could endure it no longer. At this stage she was not coming home at all. They split up. When he complained, she walked out taking the baby with her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the machinations of the court&mdash;and that wonderful `Lionelised' person who was in this place, Mr Lionel Murphy&mdash;this young man is left with no houses, no car, no child and no wife. He is 22 years of age and the child is one year old. He will be living on the $182 or $62, whichever figure members wish to choose in this case, for the rest of his days&mdash;for the next 20 years. This man's life has been shattered and wrecked, not by that woman&mdash;though she made a contribution&mdash;but by the people in this place who passed this vicious legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a committee inquiry to have 6,900 representations made to it and for the government then to decide to do nothing and for the chairman of the committee to have the temerity to say that some changes need to be publicly assailed by the front bench is a most remarkable situation. It shows how out of step with the Australian people the committee is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After 20 years experience in politics, and coming from a very successful political family, let me say that those opposite will see the greatest devastation and an even bigger landslide than against Mr Whitlam. There is a level of hatred for this government out there in the community because of the things it has done to the Australian people. If the government sets up a committee and that committee even remotely passes criticism upon the government, then it vilifies that committee. That arrogance will be dealt with by the Australian people. Please, God, let us see that happen at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the chairman of the family law committee, said, `Let's do something about keeping marriages together.' Whilst Mr Murphy made it the easiest of things to walk in and out of a marriage, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has gone one step further and made it attractive. He has made it attractive to walk out of a marriage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To cite the other case, I was going on a fairly long journey in a taxi and the driver was talking to me. He said that his son's marriage had broken up. I said, `You have the old CSA problem, I suppose.' He said that it was worse than that. The son's wife went to work one morning and said, `I am not happy in my marriage.' In every marriage in the world someone says that, probably once a month. But the girl she was working with said, `Why are you staying in this marriage?' The wife said, `I have a kid. I could not afford to get out of the marriage. Apart from any other consideration, who is going to look after the child?' The girl said, `Haven't you heard of the Child Support Agency?' She explained to the wife how it worked and how much money she would get, and the wife was gone the next day. The very next day she had walked through the door. So whilst Mr Murphy destroyed the institution of marriage in Australia and made it the easiest of things to walk in and out of that arrangement, the Prime Minister has now made it an attraction for young women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that six or seven of the other cases that have come through my door are similar. There is no solution when you have to keep two households&mdash;we have to face up to that&mdash;but if we had compulsory counselling for four months before women were allowed to get this, there would be a different situation. Surely a person can be taxed on disposable income. This person does not have a disposable income even remotely like that amount. He has a disposable income of what is left after a woman, who is no longer his wife or a relative, takes it off him. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>It is about five years since I was given the great honour of representing the electorate of Ballarat. Over that time, there have been a lot of issues facing the constituents of Ballarat, unemployment being not the least of them. There are also the problems of the collapse of small business and of youth unemployment being at such levels that people have been required to move out of the region. These are all matters that have led to very deep hurt for those constituents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one issue that I think has totally dominated the issues coming through my office and, I suspect, the offices of members from both sides of the House right throughout this country; that is, the Child Support Act. I say at the outset that the officers who have been handling this&mdash;in my local area they are mainly from Geelong&mdash;have been suffering under the most extraordinary pressure. I place on record my thanks to them for what they have done for me and for my staff when we have made inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great tragedy is that the 30 per cent of the constituents who come to see me about the Child Support Act have had to go to their local member of parliament to get any sense out of this piece of legislation. They simply cannot get it from the department because of the pressure its officers are under and the workload they have been required to suffer. They have to go to their local member of parliament to get even basic information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After seeing some of the letters and the responses to the letters I have written on behalf of constituents, I think this is the most extraordinarily bureaucratic piece of legislation I have ever seen&mdash;and I do not profess to having seen as much as the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), for example, who is here tonight. But it is an extraordinarily difficult piece of legislation. Even getting a three-page response to a letter only adds to the extraordinary level of frustration experienced by those the letter is sent out to. There is one thing to guarantee a return visit from a constituent: send them a copy of a Child Support Agency letter. I guarantee that it will only double the problems and will leave unanswered as many questions as it originally tried to solve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have seen parents, both custodial and non-custodial&mdash;I do not want to draw a difference between the two tonight because I think that debases them and debases the argument&mdash;and I can say that this has led to frustration, anger, tears and, I think, a level of desperation that I am not surprised about, even when I hear the chairman of the family law committee, the member for Chifley (Mr Price), talk tonight about that extraordinarily sad incident. I rather suspect that if it has not happened in other areas of this country it must have gone perilously close to doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has driven sensible people insane. It has driven rational people to a stage of desperation that I do not think could ever properly be tagged.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill follows the April 1994 announcements of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) and it amends three acts: the Child Support Assessment Act 1989, the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 and the Social Security Act 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill itself is split into four parts. Part 1 brings the presumption of parentage arrangements into line with Family Law Act 1975. Part 2 requires child support agreements where the custodial parent is a recipient of certain social security benefits to take reasonable measures to ensure that proper maintenance is being collected. Part 3 enables the registrar of the agency to choose not to enforce certain stage one cases&mdash;that is, if the payer's income is reduced to the level of a maximum single pension rate&mdash;or if a child leaves the ongoing care of the custodial parent. Part 4 attempts to make private collection agreements more flexible for payees, and for payees who receive income support from the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has no substantive objections to these provisions. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about some aspects of the operation of the child support scheme and its administration by the Child Support Agency within the Australian Taxation Office. The initial intention of the establishment of the agency was to collect court ordered child support, or maintenance as it was known. From 1 October 1989 it has also been collecting child support using an administrative formula for couples who separated after that date. However, since the scheme's commencement on 1 June 1988 it has created an administrative and bureaucratic nightmare of red tape, particularly for many custodial parents and ultimately, of course, for the children whom the scheme was meant to assist in the first place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Be patient, my friend. I am sure members on both sides of the House are familiar with many of these problems as a result of the difficulties brought to their attention by constituents. Indeed, we have heard some of their episodes being recited tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members opposite might feel constrained in criticising the operations of what is another addition to the many ugly creatures of this Labor government. I have spoken about the inefficiencies and inequities of this particular monster before. On 13 November 1990, in a speech in the House, I pointed out that a common complaint levelled against the Child Support Agency at that time was that of harassment involving people who were content with their own private maintenance arrangements yet were continually being pestered by the agency for their failure to take up the option of having the agency act on their behalf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also pointed out that such harassment reflects the principal incentive of some people in the welfare bureaucracy to maximise the number of clients they supposedly serve and to increase the extent of their bureaucratic empire. Let me make it perfectly clear: it is certainly desirable in my opinion that the scheme be extended to the extent that it relieves taxpayers of the burden of otherwise unsupported children. However, let me make it just as clear that the scheme should not expand at the expense of pre-existing arrangements that are satisfactory to the parties concerned. I am surprised that it took a report of a committee to find out what we already knew. An extract of what I had to say in 1989 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the child support scheme has become an imposition on people who want to remain independent of the Government's collection agency . . . Women who have told me that they are happy with their arrangements and the payments made by their former spouses have complained that they are contacted, sometimes repeatedly, by the Agency seeking to act on their behalf . . . People have found that the Child Support Agency can be so officious that the non-custodial parent who once generously provided more than the basic level of maintenance required, when faced with the big stick of enforced payment, is no longer willing to pay more than is required.</PARA>
<PARA>That was evident in 1989. It has taken this long and a very comprehensive and fine report to get the government's attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is one thing that characterises the Public Service literature on the subject of the child support scheme, it is the desire to extend the scheme to include the maximum number of eligible children, regardless of the consequential administrative and financial inefficiencies. Unbelievably, all evidence continues to point to the undeniable fact that, although the agency has been under almost continuous criticism and has been the subject of substantial reviews by the child support evaluation advisory group, nothing has changed. Hopefully, with the release this week of the report into CSA of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, we might begin to see some change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report makes it clear that private child support agreements should be the preferred means by which support is made and that the CSA should be involved only where the non-custodial parent will not pay maintenance, or is obstructionist, or both parents decide that they would prefer the CSA to collect and distribute the agreed support amount. The committee states in its report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . private collection under the scheme has developed in a different manner from what was originally envisaged. Child support agreements&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, private agreements&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">have not been widely used by parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead, many parents have opted for private collection of a CSA determined liability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development of the scheme towards this type of private collection has occurred because the scheme has placed certain restrictions on the ability of parents to choose their own arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>It is about time this sort of commonsense approach is not only spoken of but also acted upon. The government needs to implement recommendations 69 to 72 as promptly as possible just as it needs to consider the other worthwhile recommendations contained in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This latest report adds to the growing body of evidence that the CSA has become a bureaucratic nightmare. The Auditor-General's 1993-94 efficiency audit of the management of the Child Support Agency, conducted by the Australian National Audit Office, found that the scheme is riddled with serious deficiencies and administrative shortcomings. The major consequence of this is an unsatisfactory standard of service to clients. Specifically, the following serious deficiencies were identified by the ANAO audit. Most of the administrative shortcomings identified in the December 1991 report of the child support evaluation advisory group, chaired by Mr Justice Fogarty, still remain as impediments to efficient service delivery by the scheme. It is unacceptably difficult for CSA clients to contact the agency by telephone. Amen to that. There are excessive delays in dealing with correspondence from clients. Many letters are not answered. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It appears that way, and that is my experience. Management of debtors is unsatisfactory. Debtors' reporting is inadequate and misleading. Tracing of defaulting debtors is ineffective, ad hoc and inconsistent. Procedures for intercepts of tax refunds due to defaulting debtors and application of late payment penalties are stark examples of the clear lack of consistency and operations between branches. Procedures for corporate planning, performance reporting and monitoring are in need of enhancement and coordination, especially for assessments of first payment performance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no clear and specific translation of corporate goals into business unit action plans. Accountability for achievement of objectives is not based on useful and meaningful performance indicators related to program goals. Staff training is not developed on any planned and systematic basis and has little emphasis on client needs, staffing levels, staff utilisation, productivity targets. Work standards are in need of desperate improvements, supported by sound quantified analyses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The audit also recommended that urgent action be taken by the agency to reverse these problems, with a need to shift emphasis within the CSA from problem identification to problem rectification. What is most disgraceful is the fact that the audit report found that, in proportion to actual client numbers, the Ombudsman was receiving more complaints about the CSA than any other Commonwealth agency. The audit report highlights a government agency that is totally incapable of fulfilling its role in a way that does not put clients offside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To get a perspective on the gravity of these inefficiencies which go right to the core of the CSA, one must understand the hardship and difficulties that this bureaucratic nightmare imposes upon the lives of people and families who become involved with it. I will give one particular example of a male constituent. This man's wife walked out on him, leaving him with both his children to look after and a pub to run. His wife later divorced him and was awarded custody of the children. As a result of the court's settlement, he had to sell the pub, abandon his livelihood and get a job. The only job he could find was that of an ASO1 with the Public Service, which provided him with a salary of $21,000 per annum. Given the hardship and turmoil he had just been through, he was under the impression that things could not get much worse. But along came the CSA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unbelievably, the Child Support Agency assessed his annual child contribution payments to be $22,000 per annum, even though he had informed the agency of his current income, which was only $21,000 per annum. Over the following 12-month period, he tried repeatedly to contact the CSA by correspondence, by phone and in person to try to have his contributions recalculated. Finally, after 12 months, he received a positive response, but before this he was continuously told that he was up for the full $22,000. No apology was given for the delay in making a decision, nor was there an apology for the failure to reply to the correspondence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example highlighting the inefficiency of the CSA and the absurdity of some of its practices involves a couple who had divorced but were able to come to a private agreement involving the provision of child support and maintenance, whereby the father would contribute as much money as was required under the CSA formula to his ex-wife for the upbringing of the children. Once again, everything was going fine until the CSA stepped in. After applying for and receiving the sole parent's pension, the ex-wife was approached by the CSA, which pointed out to the woman that it would be wise for both the security of her and her children for the child maintenance payments to go through the CSA. The CSA stated, no doubt correctly, that this would ensure that, if her ex-husband changed his mind and reneged on his payments, he would still be bound to continue with his contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, once the CSA took control, things started to go horribly wrong. The ex-husband never missed a payment to the CSA, but his ex-wife and his children, whose security the CSA was supposedly meant to be guaranteeing, did not receive any payments from the CSA for two months. The situation became so desperate that the woman could not pay the rent and could not feed herself and her children. Ironically, it was the ex-husband who stepped in and paid money directly to his ex-wife so that she and the children would not be thrown out onto the street. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unbelievably, that man was still paying money to the CSA&mdash;a government agency which could not even properly manage the simplest and most obvious of its functions. Clearly, the CSA is an example of Labor's bureaucratic bungling. That bungling is causing untold emotional damage to many of the CSA's clients and is costing the taxpayer millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extent of this bureaucratic disaster is an absolute disgrace. It cannot be allowed to continue. The fact that the agency is such a disaster is a clear indictment of Labor in government. The government should be condemned for the abdication of its responsibilities to administer and govern in the interests of all, and especially in the interests of the weak. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government members opposite continually claim&mdash;and, in my opinion, dishonestly&mdash;that Labor is the party representing the common man and that the Australian Labor Party governs in the interests of the working class. Listening to Labor's rhetoric on that subject would lead people to believe that this government is actually looking after the interests of ordinary Australians and their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the International Year of the Family, this propaganda could not be more clearly exposed for the farce that it is than by the two examples just described, which are strongly backed up by the previously mentioned findings of the ANAO audit report. Like the ANAO, the coalition believes that the CSA requires more direct involvement at national office level to ensure that sound, consistent and effective procedures are adopted across all CSA branches, with a greater emphasis on client needs and client service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Action plans to deal with problems should be imposed by management, if required, and accountability for implementation should be made clear. This is not to suggest that a devolved means of operation is not appropriate. It simply means that devolution requires strong coordination and review. So, while the amendments provided for in this bill are important and necessary, and will be supported by the coalition, clearly they fail to provide what is needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pill that needs to be swallowed to cure the cancer which has spread throughout the CSA and this current Labor government, and to ensure that the CSA becomes an efficient and accessible division of the Australian Taxation Office&mdash;or even independent of the ATO&mdash;is not an easy one to swallow. However, one thing is certain: it could not be swallowed by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One only needs to look at Labor's irresponsible economic and fiscal policy and failing industrial relations policy to realise how incapable this government is when it comes to making the hard decisions and implementing the reform that is required to reverse the current trend of snowballing administrative malaise, bureaucratic red tape and inefficiency. That malaise is evidenced by the history of the CSA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is clearly far more interested in pandering to the demands of minority and sectional interest groups and its union mates than it is in addressing the many bureaucratic by-products of its irresponsible and downright wasteful approach to government.

It needs to address the findings of the recent report on the CSA by the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues which examined the child support legislation is an outstanding report. The crime of the whole affair is that there are two ministers who, in order to defend their reputations, claim that the Child Support Agency has nothing wrong with it and is doing a splendid job. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is an absolute untruth, typical of the untruths told by the Australian Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Central to those untruths, of course, has been the role of the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), who is here in the House tonight. He does not appear at question time, but he appears late in the evening, plotting with his friends and wondering whether the CAA is still alive and what sort of inquiry he is going to enter into next in order to bring his collapsing empire back together again. The only thing that is holding his empire together is the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). With a friend like the Prime Minister, the Minister for Transport is all right.

In order to illustrate some of the flaws within the Child Support Agency, I have brought two cases along, and I know that many other members have done the same thing. They are recent cases. This outfit, run by the Australian Taxation Office, is a criminal miscarriage of justice. I notice that the report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues is very critical of the CSA in its opening paragraphs where it says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The frequently quoted collection rate of `73 per cent of amounts registered with us' is used as the key indicator of the CSA's success. However, the Joint Committee is concerned that this collection rate is a poor measure of the CSA's actual performance due to the manner in which it is calculated.</PARA>

Unfortunately, the assessment application did not proceed and notices were issued to both parties on 2 May 1994.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak only briefly to the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. As far as constituent inquiries go, as we have heard from so many speakers this evening, the Child Support Agency and the broad issue of family disputes are ones that I do not particularly like to deal with. I do not like to deal with this issue simply because it often involves divisiveness in families or former families, allegations about one's former partner and, at the end of it all, the only losers are the kids. They end up with fighting parents making allegations about each other. The welfare of the child or children is often put on the backburner. Sometimes it can cause hatred of one's own children, which I find appalling. I have received numerous calls, as have a lot of other honourable members, both from custodial parents and non-custodial parents seeking assistance in dealing with the CSA.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In two cases, I have had a non-custodial parent and that parent's partner contact my office, both calling their ex-partner a liar, both wanting either increased support or lower payments depending on whether they had custody or not, and both offering conflicting details. Who do you believe in such cases? I assume that if we are offered such conflicting information the CSA would experience similar problems. I can therefore understand the difficulties faced by the CSA in dealing with these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I respect the privacy of my constituents and therefore I keep their details and the information they provide to me confidential. I presume that all my colleagues do the same. But what does one do when a non-custodial parent threatens to kill the children if an adverse decision is made by the CSA? A constituent actually told one of my staff members that if push came to shove the children would be killed. Another threatened the lives of employees at the CSA, as well as members of this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, although this legislation is great in theory, the problems extending from its operation have some very serious ramifications. Children, who are not to blame in parental break-ups and custodial disputes, could die because of a decision made against their non-custodial parent.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision must be made: is the non-custodial parent being overcome by emotion, or are the threats serious?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that this legislation has been enacted for some time now, it is disappointing&mdash;but probably understandable&mdash;that it has taken so long for amendments to come forward, particularly when the concerns of both custodial and non-custodial parents, which were recently outlined by the member for Chifley (Mr Price), have been well known for some time. The committee report handed down by the member for Chifley has highlighted the need for many more amendments. The amendments that we are dealing with simply tinker at the edges of the changes that are desperately required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now only a couple of weeks before Christmas, yet these amendments were announced eight months ago. I have always had trouble in getting replies to correspondence from the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), but for him to take as long with this legislation as he does with his amendments is most disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want now to comment briefly on the detail of the legislation. I realise that the concerns expressed in my preamble are not dealt with by this legislation, but I hope that they will be addressed by future amendments, particularly as the report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, which was handed down on Monday, addressed most of my concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are four parts to these amendments, all of which the coalition supports. The first part deals with presumption of parentage, and I have no qualms with that, for it expedites the identification of both paternal and maternal parents. It is intended to make the processing of applications quicker and to ensure that child support is paid sooner. It will also assist non-custodial parents by limiting the arrears bill that could occur if proof of parentage proves hard to determine and takes a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part deals with custodial parents in receipt of Department of Social Security assistance. It requires them to ensure that they are maximising their support from the non-custodial parent before becoming a burden on the taxpayer. I wholeheartedly support any measure which reduces the burden on the taxpayer and this part will ensure that the non-custodial parent pays a fair share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that really irks me is when parents shirk their responsibilities for the welfare of their offspring by arranging their statements so as to minimise the liability for the non-custodial parent and pass the burden on to the taxpayer via the social security system. I think that this is extremely un-Australian and I am glad that such an amendment is in place to ensure that both parents contribute to the support of their children, according to their capacity to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the comments of the member for Chifley when he said that no group in society should be allowed to avoid or evade its responsibilities to its children. Parents have a duty to their fellow Australians to ensure that they minimise the burden placed on the rest of the community. Therefore, they should take responsibility for the costs of supporting their children before they look to the social security system which, of course, is funded by the Australian taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wholeheartedly support part 3. Another constituent of mine, who has had a marked decrease in income, had only one option to vary maintenance and that was through the Family Court. Unfortunately, the costs were prohibitive for the constituent and the CSA could not come to the party with regard to varying the maintenance. That person&mdash;a non-custodial parent&mdash;ran a small business and was in dire financial straits; the business could have collapsed. Yet there was no way possible for relief in maintenance payments, despite a major fall in the income of the non-custodial parent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That non-custodial parent, whose pride and joy is the child&mdash;as is the case with most parents&mdash;and who would do anything for the child, also expressed concern about how the maintenance payments paid were spent. The payments of the non-custodial parent were used by the custodial parent for staying in hotels on weekends, for clothes, for restaurant meals and for the custodial parent's partner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It therefore disappoints me no end to read that the committee report, handed down on Monday, did not recommend more accountability by the custodial parent with regard to disbursement of maintenance payments. I think more action needs to be taken in this area so that the child remains and always is the beneficiary of maintenance payments and so that the payments are not wasted by the custodial parent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final part also has my support. Private payment agreements will enable greater flexibility between parents. I am aware of many parents who are still good friends, despite splitting up. They could have a satisfactory private agreement without the need for the CSA's intervention, thus enabling the CSA to concentrate its resources on cases where its involvement is of a greater necessity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While in support of this bill, the coalition has proposed a very legitimate amendment highlighting the fact that the government's bill does not go far enough. Monday's report of the committee looking into this legislation backed that up. I therefore have no hesitation in supporting the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I highlight the point that this speech should please all students of the school of political correctness in that I have not, whilst talking about a number of constituents, mentioned the gender of any person. Therefore, no-one can accuse me of sexism, chauvinism or any other `ism'. Not mentioning gender highlights the problem and not the specific constituent case to which I have referred. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting to listen to the previous speakers on the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill, particularly in light of the fact that the Child Support Agency and the problems encountered by a lot of people in our electorates probably keep us busy 75 per cent of the time. I think that would be the case for members right around this chamber. That has been evidenced not only by the speeches that have been made here tonight but also by the bipartisanship of the report from the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, released earlier this week. That committee has taken an enormous amount of evidence and an enormous number of submissions from right around Australia to address this very serious issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While acknowledging that the government is attempting to improve the legislation as it stands at the moment, I think&mdash;hundreds of people have made representations to me and I have made representations on their behalf to the minister in charge of this particular area of the portfolio&mdash;these changes do not go far enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system obviously is not working well enough when there are hundreds of millions of dollars not collected. There are custodial parents out there that have not received and are not receiving money from non-custodial parents. Non-custodial parents are left with precious little to live on and are forced to live in poverty to pay the rate expected of them by the CSA. Under the circumstances non-custodial parents find themselves in, in a lot of cases they are being forced to give up employment to get out of the responsibility of paying the money to the CSA and to the custodial parent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an absolute Pandora's box. Talk about a can of worms. I did not expect to be confronted with this when I was elected as a member of this parliament in March last year, but certainly the dominant issue in my offices in both Taree and Port Macquarie is that of problems with the Child Support Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying that the people who exercise the policy on behalf of the government through the Australian Taxation Office are at fault but certainly I think people who are trained and have operated for years in the tax office are not trained in dealing with the emotive sorts of issues that present themselves when people have problems with the Child Support Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of areas that I am sure are all addressed very well in the Price report on the child support scheme. It has been interesting to note the tension between the two ministers involved and the chairman of the committee, the member for Chifley (Mr Price), earlier this week. That is how deep the feelings are and that reflects the high emotion that exists out there in the community with regard to this system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the system was first established, the ideals were quite admirable. In the background paper it states that, in its 1986 discussion paper on child support, the cabinet subcommittee on maintenance identified the impetus behind reform of child maintenance laws. The government sees a need to strike a fairer balance between public and private forms of support to alleviate the poverty of sole parent families and to achieve some constraint on government outlays on sole parent payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would imagine that the latter was the greater imperative at the time; the government was trying to alleviate government outlays on sole parent payments. That was good. People who expect to have all sorts of rights in our community should also expect to shoulder their fair share of the responsibilities. That is basically what this is all about. But it is lacking an element of fairness and equity on both sides of the equation. You could write a book about the unbelievable circumstances that a lot of people find themselves in as a result of this system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Non-custodial parents, custodial parents and fathers who are non-custodial parents walk in and out of both my electorate offices on a daily basis. A mother who is a nursing sister and the custodial parent of two children has also walked into my office. Her former husband is the custodial parent of one child. He is unemployed, so the mother, who is caring for two children out of the three, is paying CSA to the father for the one child whilst he is unemployed and collecting unemployment benefits. It is just unbelievable. She cannot even afford to feed and clothe the two children she has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cases we can cite are absolutely limitless. I know a lot of the speakers tonight have spoken about the custodial parents and the problems that they are having in, firstly, collecting the payments from the non-custodial parents, and, secondly, getting a fair go out of the Child Support Agency. A large percentage of the complaints and representations I have made on behalf of constituents to the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) have been about the inequity of the equation, or the formula, in working out what non-custodial parents should be contributing to the scheme and what they are left with. Again we have this notion that a fair amount to live on per week should be the same whether that person lives in Sydney, Taree, Port Macquarie, Perth or Brisbane. It is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We apply a percentage to what they are to contribute to the scheme per child and the non-custodial parents are left with x number of dollars per week. There are a lot of non-custodial parents who, because of the circumstances they are forced into, opt out of the work force and say, `What is the point of going on? The government will pay me unemployment benefits to do nothing. When I move into that situation, I do not have to pay the CSA any more. The government will pay my wife sole parents benefit, or whatever it is.' In that way they get themselves out of that circumstance. There are not just single cases of this happening; there are lots of cases of it happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I was talking to one of the members from Queensland where a non-custodial parent owned a business that was travelling reasonably well. It was producing an income for him and he employed six people. But when the formula was applied to him, with the contributions that he had to make to the Child Support Agency, he was better off to close the business down, put those six men off and go on the dole. He did that. He did it because logic leaves the whole equation when we start moving into these emotional issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not had an in-depth look at the report. I think the formula percentages are addressed under child support assessment considerations in one section. I urge the government to have a serious look at that because we will never be able to quantify the economic ramifications it is having on government revenue. But I can assure the House that that sort of situation is very widespread across Australia. If my electorate is any indication, it is. A lot of people are in that circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very difficult issue to deal with. We agree with the initial legislation that was brought in some time ago&mdash;certainly before my time&mdash;which makes people shoulder their responsibilities and which takes the burden off government outlays. But let us look at this in a very objective manner. The opportunity is now before the government to have a serious look at this unanimous report from the committee which was chaired by a government member and which comprised a majority of government members. The government should have a serious look at where fairness and equity lie in this system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The eyes of a lot of people around Australia will be on the government to see whether it does the right thing and whether it does it properly. It should not just pay lip-service to what this report is about and to what the people of Australia, through correspondence to all members of this House who have been forwarding this correspondence to the Assistant Treasurer, have been asking for: that is, reviews of the circumstances under which these situations are being dealt with right across Australia. The challenge is before the government to do something equitably and fairly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In commenting on the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1994, I am going to mention the work of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, of which I am a member. The joint select committee has just completed an inquiry that began on 13 May 1993 into the operation and effectiveness of the child support scheme. The committee, an all-party committee, tabled its unanimous report containing 163 wide ranging recommendations. The report was tabled on Monday this week&mdash;5 December. I do not intend to address the recommendations of the committee generally, but I will refer to those that are specifically relevant to the provisions of this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The child support scheme was set up in 1988 to ensure that parents retained financial responsibility for their children when the family unit broke down. Under the scheme, the Child Support Agency collects payment from the non-custodial parent, usually the father, and passes it on to the custodial parent for the support of the child or children of the family. I use the expressions `custodial parent' and `non-custodial parent' with considerable reluctance, because they express a proprietary interest in children which is quite inappropriate. Fortunately, legislation recently passed by this House would see an end to the notion of children being the subject of custody and would see children being more the responsibility of parents and the subject of parenting plans. In view of their use up until now, I will continue to use those terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme is divided into two parts: the first stage is for children whose support was decided upon by a court before October 1989; the second stage is for children born on or after 1 October 1989 and for all children of parents who separated on or after that date. Under stage 2, the amount of child support is calculated by a formula based on the non-custodial parent's taxable income. Stage 2 parents can apply to the Child Support Agency for a review of their child support formula assessment, whereas stage 1 parents must go back to the court to have their maintenance amount amended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has on many occasions acknowledged the importance of the child support scheme to many Australian families. It is because the scheme is so important&mdash;a lifeline for many families&mdash;that the government must ensure that it is operating equitably and efficiently. In fact, it is widely recognised in the community that the scheme is failing its clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The joint select committee in its report drew attention to these failings and made recommendations for improvements to the system. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has admitted that the child support scheme needs reforming. In a press release on 7 June this year, the Assistant Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I agree with the Auditor-General that there have been problems in administration.</PARA>
<PARA>Earlier, on 6 April, the Assistant Treasurer issued a press release announcing a series of changes to the operations of the Child Support Agency, the body responsible for administering the scheme. In his press release, the Assistant Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the number of clients the Agency deals with continues to grow and is not expected to peak for about ten years. These are often the most difficult cases where parents cannot agree.</PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the sheer volume of growth has created its own problems for the efficient operation of the Child Support Agency, and for communications between the Agency and parents.</PARA>
<PARA>The Assistant Treasurer went on to announce the details of the changes to the operations of the Child Support Agency. These included both legislative and administrative changes. The administrative changes were to be implemented straight away. They addressed several problems: the time taken by the Child Support Agency to respond to clients by phone or mail; the agency's lack of sensitivity to client's needs; communication problems between the agency and its clients; the unacceptably high level of arrears of child support payments; the lack of efficient case management; and inadequate liaison with interested community groups such as the Australian Council of Social Service, Dads Against Discrimination, and the Council of Single Mothers and their Children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislative amendments foreshadowed by the Assistant Treasurer in April have now seen the light of day in the form of this bill. This bill aims to make certain limited reforms to the child support scheme and touches on several areas. Firstly, there is the presumption of parentage arrangements which are to be brought into line with the provisions of the Family Law Act 1975. Secondly, custodial parents who receive certain social security benefits will be required to take reasonable measures to ensure that they are collecting proper maintenance under a child support agreement. Thirdly, the Child Support Agency registrar may choose not to enforce collection of maintenance by custodial parents in stage one cases if the non-custodial parent's income is reduced to a particular level, or if the child leaves the continuous care of the custodial parent. Fourthly, private collection agreements will be made more flexible for custodial parents who receive income support from the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will first address the proposed amendments to the presumption of parentage provisions. Proof that the non-custodial parent is in fact the child's parent is crucial in many cases because unless the person is the child's parent he or she may not be liable to support the child. The bill proposes to align the child support legislation with the provisions of the Family Law Act by allowing the child support registrar to be satisfied that a man is a parent of a child if certain conditions relating to the man's cohabitation with the child's mother and the date of the child's birth have been satisfied. The aim of this amendment is to assist clients who can satisfy these conditions by speeding the processing of their applications for child support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment is welcomed as far as it goes, but it does not go far enough. The real problem that exists is in the cases of disputed parentage. In disputed cases the interests of both parties have to be carefully balanced. It is important that neither party is adversely affected by the dispute, but that the interests of the child are treated as paramount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In cases such as this, the joint select committee has recommended that legislation be amended to enable the child support registrar to collect and hold in trust child support money until the parentage dispute is settled by the Family Court. This would protect the rights of the non-custodial party by keeping open the possibility of returning child support money if the dispute is resolved in that party's favour. If the paying party were held to be the child's biological parent, then the amount held in trust would be paid directly to the custodial parent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To avoid the potential hardship caused to one or both parties by delays in the hearing of the dispute, the joint select committee recommended that the courts hear these cases as a matter of priority. The committee further recommended that the Family Court delegate to the family court registrars the power to resolve child support related paternity disputes. I urge the government to make more than merely superficial amendment to the parentage provisions of the child support legislation by adopting these recommendations of the joint select committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next set of amendments to the child support legislation affects custodial parents who are clients of the Department of Social Security. Where a custodial parent who is receiving benefits, such as the sole parent pension, enters into a child support agreement with the non-custodial parent, it is proposed that that agreement be examined for its adequacy under the `reasonable action for maintenance' provisions of the Social Security Act 1991. This means that parents will not be able to register private agreements at less than the Child Support Agency's formula and in so doing transfer the extra cost from the non-custodial parent to the Department of Social Security and thus ultimately to the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will be a compulsory process that will require the custodial parent to take reasonable action to ensure that he or she is receiving adequate maintenance. The aim of these amendments as expressed in the explanatory memorandum accompanying the bill is to ensure that both parents contribute to the support of their children according to their capacity to pay while minimising social security outlays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such an aim is laudable and touches on a principal recommendation of the joint select committee. The committee in its report recommended that the government adopt an order of priorities regarding the objectives of the child support scheme. That order would be: first, adequate support is available to all children not living with both parents; secondly, non-custodial parents share in the cost of child support according to their capacity to pay; and, thirdly, Commonwealth expenditure is limited to the minimum necessary to ensure the adequacy of child support to all children not living with both parents. Again I urge the government to consider the recommendations of the joint select committee and undertake a comprehensive and thorough reform of the child support legislation along the lines of those recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third set of amendments proposed by the bill relate to the non-enforcement of certain stage 1 maintenance agreements. Parents with these agreements, court ordered maintenance agreements registered under the child support scheme, are currently allowed to vary their liabilities only by applying to the Family Court. The Child Support Agency does not have the power to exercise discretion in not collecting child support if a party's situation changes. For example, the non-custodial parent may become unemployed or receive sickness benefits and the child may no longer be in the care of the custodial parent. It is often expensive and time consuming for a non-custodial parent to appeal to the Family Court to alter his or her liability for payments. The result is often to leave the non-custodial parent with large bills for arrears of child support payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of the proposed amendments giving the registrar the power not to enforce a registered liability for a certain period is to waive the liability temporarily. That does not mean that the agreement has actually been changed. The parents will need to return to the court if the change is to be made permanent. If a non-custodial parent finds employment while his or her liability to make child support payments is not being enforced for the reason that he or she had become unemployed, then that parent must inform the registrar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The joint select committee noted in its report that the child support legislation imposes a penalty of imprisonment for a maximum period of six months where a person knowingly makes a statement or omits any matter from a statement which makes the statement false or misleading in a material way. However, the report notes that there is no existing penalty for people who recklessly or inadvertently provide false or misleading information to the Child Support Registrar. As a result, the committee recommended that a financial penalty be introduced for persons who recklessly or inadvertently give the Child Support Agency false or misleading information about their current monthly taxable income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The joint select committee also recommended that a monetary penalty be introduced for persons who either knowingly, recklessly or inadvertently fail to notify the Child Support Agency of any increase in their monthly taxable income of 15 per cent or more when required to do so. It is important to the integrity of the child support scheme and the operations of the Child Support Agency generally that clients are encouraged to provide accurate income information, or at least discouraged from failing to provide accurate information. This recognises that the primary objective of the scheme is that parents bear the responsibility for the financial support of their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a vexed area. There are more far-reaching problems in the child support system that involve the calculation of child support payments from the non-custodial parent's taxable income. The child support income base for each parent is equal to each parent's taxable income from two years before the child support year, multiplied by the indexation factor. Problems arise because self-employed non-custodial parents can easily avoid their child support obligations. It is to be regretted that any parent would avoid his or her proper obligations towards his or her children. Unfortunately, it is a fact of life that some parents are guilty of such behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The joint select committee concluded that the Child Support Agency should undertake research to identify the precise number of parents from the child support scheme who receive income from business structures and the extent to which these parents are minimising their child support obligations. The committee considers that only when this has been done will the agency be able to develop strategies to respond efficiently to the problem caused by parents who receive business and investment income and who minimise their child support liabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The joint select committee made detailed recommendations which address this problem. In its report, the committee says that taxable income should be used to assess the capacity to pay of pay-as-you-earn taxpayers. However, the committee said that taxable income should be used only as the starting point for assessing the capacity to pay of parents who receive business or investment income because these parents can easily structure their financial affairs in order to reduce their child support liabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The joint select committee recommended that the Child Support Registrar be given the power to separately assess parents with business or investment income and a capacity to pay that is greater than is indicated by their taxable income. The committee has suggested an individual review process that would allow the Child Support Registrar to vary the formula assessment if necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the joint select committee made a series of detailed recommendations on this particular problem, to which I cannot do justice in the present debate. Suffice it to say that the committee recommended that the Child Support Agency implements, firstly, a targeted audit program in respect of parents who receive business or investment income; secondly, a random system of auditing parents who receive business or investment income; and, thirdly, a system of public rulings and other appropriate measures to inform parents and their advisers of the Child Support Registrar's practice in the assessment of a parent's capacity to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth set of amendments to the child support legislation contained in this bill provides for the extension of private payment arrangements. When he or she registers a child support agreement a custodial parent has the option of choosing whether he or she wishes to collect the child support payments himself or herself&mdash;in other words, privately&mdash;or whether he or she would like the Child Support Agency to collect the payments from the non-custodial parent. The custodial parent may later change his or her mind, unless he or she is receiving benefits from the Department of Social Security. Custodial parents who have elected to have their child support collected by the Child Support Agency and who receive social security benefits cannot later revert to collecting the support payments privately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes proposed by the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill are designed to introduce greater freedom for all child support recipients to make arrangements for payment to be made privately. The bill allows the custodial parent to collect child support privately as long as the parent making payments has a satisfactory record of reliability. Payments must not be in arrears at the time of election, and all payments must have been made on time by the date of the election. However, if the new arrangement is not successful, the custodial parent may elect for the Child Support Agency to collect the child support. In these circumstances, the bill also allows the custodial parent to claim up to three months' worth of arrears. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The joint select committee considers that many parents who voluntarily pay child support to the agency on time could be moved safely off agency collection. The committee believes that this could be achieved by giving the Child Support Registrar the discretion to substitute private collection for agency collection where the paying parent has established a reliable voluntary payment record of six months. The committee recommended that the registrar's discretion should ordinarily be exercised in favour of private collection except where the special circumstances of the case require otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will always be cases where private collection of child support payments is not appropriate, such as those involving domestic violence. But one should encourage parties to enter into private collection agreements where it is appropriate. Such agreements allow both parents to have greater flexibility within the child support scheme. It also minimises collection costs for the Child Support Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the provisions of this bill, only those payers who have a satisfactory payment record will be able to change to private collection. The child's interests are protected because if the payer becomes unreliable the custodial parent may choose to return to having the agency act as collector with the power to collect arrears. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments are important and necessary but they are insufficient. They fall well short of what is required. What is required is a wholesale, comprehensive reform of the child support system. The Child Support Agency must become efficient and it must become accessible to its clients, to the families it serves. The administrative changes announced by the Assistant Treasurer in April 1994 have not achieved the improvements they were aimed at. If the government is to earn any credibility at all in the area of child support, then it must look at the recommendations of the joint select committee and lose no time in implementing long overdue reforms. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak briefly in support of the amendment moved to the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 as I believe it encapsulates the frustration, anxiety and pain felt by many Australians who have to deal with the Child Support Agency. In my office in Bundaberg, and to a lesser extent in my office in Gladstone, there would be no single issue that has raised the ire of my constituents more than the issue of the Child Support Agency. Speaker after speaker tonight has made that same observation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have got to recognise that it was the government that created the CSA and it has been this government that has left the agency to squander and destroy many lives over the last six years because of its poor administration, its inflexibility and its poor client focus. The evidence of the CSA's failings were presented to us this week in the damning report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Matters on the agency and in its urgent calls for reform. I compliment the member for Chifley (Mr Price) for his great dedication and sincerity in this matter and I am appalled at the ambivalence of two of the ministers to some of the recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the member for Tangney (Mr Williams) said, we are a long way from fixing the matter up even now and the partial reforms that were announced by the minister earlier this year have gone no way to correcting the problems. I have had a stream of people coming through the office saying that they are getting accounts and being told that they are underpaying or that they are in arrears when they are actually in credit, and so on. This creates a great deal of tension not only for the person involved but between the custodial and non-custodial parents. Loosely paraphrased or condensed, I suppose you could say that the major complaints about the CSA revolve around poor leadership and staff management; lack of national policy and guidelines; poor level of cooperation between the Department of Social Security and the Child Support Agency; lack of appropriate work ethic by the CSA staff; and inappropriate delays in application, registration and collection of child support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to move from that to the human cost that this agency has caused to people who have come under its regime. Many stories presented in this debate recount the evidence of this human cost and the ineffectiveness of the government agency. The member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) quoted a case, actually from my electorate, where a man with quite a successful business with six employees decided that, if the Child Support Agency was going to pursue him in the way that it had, he would give up the whole issue, close down the business and go on the dole. If we are talking about collecting money for the public purse, just imagine what we are now paying for. We have probably got six or seven people out there on the dole, we are not having those children in any way supported, and what we have is a hatred situation between the custodial and the non-custodial parent. I think it is largely because of the inflexibility of the agency that this particular case came about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had another case in my electorate where a young man who was separated from his wife decided to improve his skills level and to take on an adult apprenticeship. It was absolutely extraordinary the ends that he had to go to try to convince the agency that he was actually now living at a lower income level. One of the most appalling features of it was that, because in the particular adult apprenticeship to which he had gone there was a component of a bonus at the end of the completion of the apprenticeship, that bonus was taken into account and apportioned over the years of the apprenticeship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although you might argue that at the end of the process he was going to receive a bonus, for the three or four years of that apprenticeship, his effective weekly income was reduced to a level where he lived in abject poverty. He could not spend the bonus. In fact, there was no certainty that he would pass the tests or the exams associated with the apprenticeship. In fact, because he was an adult apprentice, there was perhaps some chance that he may not have completed the course. Because of that and because of the inflexibility of the CSA, he went on for those three or four years in a state of abject poverty living in the barracks of a mine in central western Queensland and with a lack of recognition of what he required just to maintain a basic standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other instances, we have seen great sadness in families because of tension between the custodial and the non-custodial parents, and an inflexibility on the part of the CSA to vary arrangements. I heard the member for Tangney explaining how the interim measures might exist for the suspension of payments. I suggested in my submission to the CSA inquiry that we perhaps needed something like a clerk of the court in each major provincial centre, so that where there was a transparent change in the circumstances of the non-custodial parent and where the custodial parent was agreeable, this officer could inspect the arrangements, see that they were legitimate and then act on behalf of the registrar to enshrine that new arrangement. It would have been a very simple procedure and it would have allowed a lot of these cases that eventually go back to court to be dealt with expeditiously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other complaints that I have received have been of non-custodial parents being bled dry by inflexible maintenance formulas, non-custodial parents deliberately minimising their incomes to reduce their maintenance obligation, custodial parents unable to obtain maintenance and departmental interference in amicable private arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just referring briefly to the custodial parents being unable to obtain maintenance, one of the saddest cases I have seen was a case where a non-custodial parent of one relationship was paying legitimate payments to his ex-wife for his three children. Somewhat later he moved into a relationship with another woman who also had three children but in her case the non-custodial parent was not paying any maintenance at all; he was one of these fly by nighters. So we had this new family with one custodial parent, the non-custodial parent of another group and three children. The non-custodial parent of those three children was paying nothing to that family and the family lived in what was little more than abject poverty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking through the recommendations, I must say they have some laudable applications and if all these 163 recommendations can be implemented, then certainly we will have a fair arrangement. But while I find some of the recommendations laudable, I think that in many cases they will be quite impractical. In one recommendation that I found almost extraordinary the joint committee recommends that the Child Support Agency introduce an administrative measure to ensure that it is advised of clients who are subject to or at risk of abuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And then it says that the CSA should assign senior staff to be solely responsible for the management of each case and provide direct telephone numbers of case officers to clients subject to, or at risk of, domestic violence. This is an organisation that could not answer basic correspondence and could not get its accounts right. In the massive restructure that will be required just to get the basic administrative structure in order, how in heaven's name will it be able to undertake tasks like that? I recommend that the minister&mdash;I hope that he and his colleague will override their own ambivalence&mdash;take this in a very orderly fashion and be generous with staff levels to the CSA, because the recommendations in this document have not the least hope of being addressed unless it is done in that spirit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of the other things that I was going to say have been said. People come to an electorate office out of sheer frustration. After trying the CSA they end up more confused and emotionally charged. After waiting for half an hour or longer just to speak to someone in the agency on the telephone&mdash;it is often an unsympathetic voice&mdash;and, as you would be well aware from the submissions, not being able to get back to the same case officer because of the rule of not giving names, makes the whole thing impossible and generates a lot of the angst that exists between custodial and non-custodial parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the joint select committee's 163 recommendations are taken on board. I hope the minister approaches them in an orderly fashion, moves through those incredibly bad administrative areas and deals with case loads and personal contacts in a most professional way for the benefit of the families that are so dependent on this agency. </PARA>

<PARA>This request was the main issue of the Senate debate. Under the legislation, a young person qualifies as independent if that person has been self-supporting during the qualifying period. This, I should point out, is separate from the issue of young people who cannot live at home because of extreme family breakdown or similar circumstances. Those young people qualify as independent without any qualifying period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the jobsearch allowance, the qualifying period has been 18 weeks. The government proposed changing the qualifying period to 26 weeks. This change reflects the introduction of the away from home rate. The away from home rate will pay the same maximum rate as the independent rate, but it will apply a means test to the parents' income and assets. The away from home rate will address the situation of young people who need to live away from home for jobsearch or training reasons. The away from home rate is payable immediately, without any qualifying period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed changes of the opposition parties to this independence criterion are to reduce the qualifying rate from 26 weeks to 18 weeks and to provide that a young person need not have been self-supporting during the qualifying period. The government was prepared to agree to support the reduction of the qualifying period to 18 weeks if the proposal were modified to clarify that the young person was in fact self-supporting during the qualifying period, that the young person should have been employed during the qualifying period rather than merely registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service, and that the young person should not have been supported by his parents. In subsequent discussions, I understand that the opposition has indicated that it will accept the government's compromise proposal as presented to the House tonight. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The reasons read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments are opposed on the basis that they are no more workable than the existing provisions introduced by the Democrats in July. These amendments still reward a person's failure to meet his/her obligations by paying the person two further payments of allowance before a deferment of allowance is imposed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the Government's substantial commitment to unemployed people announced in Working Nation, it would be unacceptable to allow the Greens' amendments to pass, thereby enabling jobseekers who are clearly in breach of their reciprocal obligations to continue to receive allowance for a further four weeks. This would not be acceptable in terms of sound policy and administration or in terms of equity in the eyes of the Australian taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To complement the increased assistance to be provided to jobseekers, the Government announced in Working Nation enhanced reciprocal obligations for those receiving income support. The Government believes that provision of a period of notice before payment of allowance is deferred sends the wrong signals to jobseekers about the importance of their reciprocal obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill seeks to rectify this by providing that recipients be properly notified of the imposition of a deferment period, but that this period commences on the day that notice is given, rather than after two further payments of allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Administrative processes already provide that notices are issued to a person warning that a deferment period may be imposed if a breach is not remedied. In this regard, it should be noted that the report on the bill by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs considered that the administrative processes in place prior to the July amendments had inbuilt safeguards which did provide sufficient notice of deferment of income support without the need for additional payments periods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill conforms with administrative procedures that were in place up to July 1994, and which the Government believes were fair and equitable and provided sufficient notice to the person of the consequences of failing to respond to a specific requirement made of the person.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, these procedures were:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)the person was given a clear requirement to attend or contact the CES and a deadline to respond by (5-21 days hence);</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2)failure to respond to that requirement always generated a second letter which clearly warned the person that he/she risked loss of allowance if he/she failed to respond within a further 14 days;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3)the CES could be approached at any time during this process to change an appointment or listen to a person's reasons or complaints;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4)when a person was found to be in breach of a particular requirement, he/she is notified of the decision in writing and had immediate recourse to a well-established review and appeals process which ensured that his/her concerns are responded to promptly; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5)there was discretion on the part of the reviewing officer to continue payment of allowance pending review where circumstances warranted this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not the Government's aim to deal harshly with the unemployed&mdash;however, it is the Government's responsibility, on behalf of the whole community, to ensure that jobseekers respond positively to the many and varied measures of assistance offered to them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is unfortunate that this report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A review of Australia's efforts to promote and protect human rights</EMPHASIS>, is not being debated in the main chamber. To my mind, few reports are of as great a significance, in this day and age, as one which tries to address the fundamentals of the divisions that regrettably are still apparent around the world and the inhumanities that also regrettably characterise the behaviour of too many governments and too many people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report, which identifies so many of those inhumanities, is intended to pick up Australian attitudes towards them and has, as its basis, the deliberation of the way in which human rights are progressing. The report itself is an outstanding publication. Margaret Swieringa and her staff are in the gallery. In spite of the paucity of resources which regrettably characterises the committee system, or this particular subcommittee, it is an outstanding publication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its cover, contents and message, the report has much from which parliamentarians from all parties&mdash;and, indeed, the public at large&mdash;could benefit by reading. It is for that reason that it would have been far better had the report been available for debate in the main chamber, where some of the nuances that are important in any analysis of human rights could have been debated more fully, and where there might have been greater exposure to the substance of the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are only a few matters that I will address, although there are many on which I would like to spend a little time. Unfortunately, I have another commitment this morning, one related to Bougainville, which I feel should have priority, as Bougainville is one issue of this report that I think needs to be identified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, as far as the overall analysis goes, this is only the second report that the committee has produced. It imposes an almost impossible burden to expect a full, detailed analysis of human rights around the world in the manner of the United States Congress, which we are told has up to 77 members of staff to prepare the report. Margaret Swieringa labours with somewhat less than that number of staff, and it is remarkable that she has been able to do as much as she has. We can all say thanks not only to Margaret Swieringa but to Margaret Cahill, Patricia Ahlgren and Rashida Chanbhhi for what is indeed an outstanding publication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report itself tries to cover a number of particular issues. We have looked at the United Nations and, while the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) has initiated some debate on reform of the United Nations, there is considerable interest in the Australian parliament&mdash;as there should be in the Australian community&mdash;as to just where the United Nations goes from here. There had been some belief that a new world order was going to follow the Gulf War. That has not happened and, indeed, the absolute trauma of present events in Bosnia shows how ineffective even United Nations peacekeeping forces can be, unless the belligerent parties have goodwill, good intent and some uniformity of desire to end war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason the United Nations does need to be reformed. It is going to be very difficult to get the Permanent Five to accept the sorts of changes that many of us believe are necessary. From Australia's point of view, the worry is not just in the mechanisms of the Security Council or the United Nations plenary; it is the organisation itself. I have long felt that a lot could be done to make the whole of the operation of the United Nations Secretariat so much more efficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not like the absolute power that is given to the Secretary-General; I believe the structure of the administration is inefficient, and I believe that much could be done, not just in the peacekeeping role, where we have seen the degree to which ineptitude in management has created hazards for those on the ground&mdash;and lack of resources lies behind much of that. There are three elements that need to be looked at: resources of the United Nations, the administration of the United Nations and the decision taking process. In the advocacy of the Australian government each of those needs to have priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In opposition it is very hard for us to play the role that many of us feel is necessary in transforming the United Nations from what it is to something more effective. But now, 50 years on from the end of world war and the establishment of the United Nations, it is appropriate that that particular subject be high on the political agenda. Next year is when I hope that we can look at this in greater depth, and for that reason I think that part of this report relating to the United Nations is particularly important because it is from that that the mechanisms of consultation and peacekeeping and the processes of trying to bring peace to war-torn lands can best be pursued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also flows that there is need for people to exercise goodwill one to one. Much of this report looks at human rights as distinct from the processes among governments. It is appalling that in so many countries around the world the abuse of power is still such that people suffer. Day after day we hear of suffering of, say, the Kurds, people in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in Bougainville, in Cambodia, in Burma, in Tibet and in so many parts of the world&mdash;one can go on. There are real traumas that seem to rest back in another day and age and it is diabolic that these should continue. It is very important that the Australian parliament tries to identify these problems as far as it can to see what can be done internationally at a government level to correct them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has not only looked at the international arena: chapter 7 relates to a visit that we made to the Northern Territory, to Pigeon Hole, to Kalaringi, to Daguragu and to Mistake Creek. My own view of many of those places really was that education is sadly neglected. While conclusions are reached in this report, it seemed to me that it is education and health and hygiene of the Aboriginal people themselves that lead to many of the consequences there. The problems are not there, to a large degree, as a result of direct malfeasance but as a result of people not really knowing how to use the systems that are available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An example was the contrast in Pigeon Hole. The overseer's cottage of Wave Hill Station had no problem with the sewerage system or the septic, and the school equally had no problems with the septic system and the overflow system, but  in the Pigeon Hole community there were demonstrable problems. To my mind, it was a matter of putting newspapers down toilets and not cleaning out the sullage pit at the end of the septic. As somebody who lives in the bush I know that these things have to be attended to regularly. Those who live in those communities need to be educated to help themselves. It does not mean that governments do not have a major responsibility, and we have drawn attention in the report to the Aboriginal eye health program and to housing. There is also reference in this report to the need for education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two countries that I want to briefly mention are East Timor and Bougainville. I think it is tragic that there still continue to be quite demonstrable abuses of the East Timorese people. Numbers of us, including some who are in the Main Committee today, were in East Timor a little while ago. I believe there are several things that the Indonesian government has to accept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first is that just applying Javanese law over East Timor is not going to produce the outcome that it seeks. I, unlike others, believe quite strongly that the government's policy of recognition of Indonesian sovereignty is the only desirable and practical outcome, but I believe that that sovereignty brings responsibility. I do not think that responsibility is being shown. I believe that Portuguese should be available in the schools. I believe that the prejudices being shown in the administration of East Timor would, to a large degree, be overcome if the large Javanese and military presences were eased and more East Timorese were given responsibility. I think it is appalling that, in that centre, there still appears to be the basis of so much ferment. A return to Portuguese rule is not the answer. Portugal was a disaster; nobody contends with that. Our problem is to try to find a way through it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">East Timor is one of Australia's closest neighbours. There has to be a way in which the Indonesian government can administer that province without the heavy-handed approach that leads to the protests and demonstrations which, only a few weeks ago, saw a number of East Timorese students seeking political asylum in the American embassy and, eventually, transferring to Portugal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe East Timor is a real test for the government of Indonesia. President Suharto has emerged from the APEC conference with a great deal of glory and with proper adulation. He needs to now capitalise on that within his own responsibilities. I believe the real testing point will be how he overcomes the problems of East Timor. There is attention given to that in this report, and it is a matter which I believe needs to be addressed responsibly by the Australian government at all levels. I believe that the Indonesian government, in return, must respond. It is not just a matter of what the United Nations feels about the claim to sovereignty; it is about how the people themselves feel. Demonstrably, in East Timor there is a chronic problem which, to date, has not been resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue I want to refer to is Bougainville, which is, I think, a great tragedy. Those of us who visited there last year as members of the Human Rights Subcommittee came back feeling a great deal of hope. I thought, at that stage, that commonsense might have prevailed. But, given the degree to which rumours run rife and the bashing that Sir Paul Lapun received over what was an absolutely false story&mdash;that we had given him $35,000, or some large sum of money, for distribution, and he had taken it for himself&mdash;it worries me that resolution of the conflict is so far away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my mind, there are several things that need to be done. I am very disappointed that the peace process begun after the change of the administration with Sir Julius Chan taking over from Paias Wingti as Prime Minister has not led to a peace settlement. I believe that the processes are still possible, but I think it is important that that personal contact between Sir Julius Chan and the leaders of the BRA is essential to achieve that. Whether it was because of lack of consultation in the process or because of an excess of Australian involvement, I find it hard to reach a conclusion as to why the process ultimately failed. But we all have a vested interest in the success of the peacekeeping process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no question that the mine cannot be opened in the near future. The members of the government of PNG&mdash;and, certainly, the Prime Minister&mdash;need to put that from their minds. Whatever the financial problems of PNG may be, opening the mine in Bougainville is not going to secure a peaceful outcome for the people of Bougainville. What is important, putting aside the mine, is to find a way by which people in Bougainville can live together again. Going to care centres is a disaster. It is like going to a refugee centre anywhere. People should not have to live in those circumstances. There are continuing stories of killings and of undoubted human rights abuses, and they are not something that anybody in their right mind could condone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of where blame lies and the degree to which the PNG defence force is still using military force are very hard things to determine, but I think it is important that the peace process not be allowed to be stalled. It seems to have, for the moment. I hope Sir Julius Chan can take another new initiative and can again commence negotiations with the leaders of the BRA, to find another mechanism by which the peace process can be pursued, and that normalcy in health, education and all community facilities can proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without doubt, Bougainville is one of the richest provinces of PNG. There is every reason for it to be able to restore itself to a peaceful condition, without the traumas that have beset the place, for what seemed to be no good reason, over the past few years. I know that that really was one of the objectives of those of us who were on that mission to PNG. I hope that that initiative will not be totally forestalled because of the problems. In this report, we have made a number of recommendations which need to be picked up by the Australian government and, hopefully, by the government of PNG, for I think they will go part of the way to recommencing the process of restoring peace to Bougainville. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I was very disappointed to see that Senator Dee Margetts has added a minority report to this report. I thought it added nothing. I thought it demonstrated that she is not prepared to be part of the normal political process. All of us have to accept compromise. The objective of trying to secure human rights should be above the prejudices of individuals. To my mind, having one person come out and say that she does not agree, as she has, demonstrates how difficult it is to achieve peace around the world. Senator Margetts sat with us and contributed at every meeting and she participated in the other decisions. But when it was all over she came out and said, `I do not agree with it anyway.' This demonstrates to me that, while we have people such as Senator Dee Margetts, there is little hope for those of us trying to achieve what we thought was a worthwhile objective.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thomas Jefferson once said that the execution of the laws was more important than the making of them. For a law-maker who believes strongly in the importance of the rule of law, and by no means wishing to undermine my own role, I approve of this statement. For the past 18 months, the Human Rights Subcommittee has considered the implementation of the human rights standards which have been defined over the past 50 years by the United Nations. There are of course standards which have underpinned government practice in many societies for much longer than that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise that judging matters of policy for promoting and protecting human rights is fraught with difficulty. This is partly because judgments are hard to make, especially in a short time and at a distance from the circumstances. It is also partly because there are many paradoxes inherent in the possible solutions to problems. When is action better than negotiation? When is intervention advisable? Can peacemaking prolong the misery and exacerbate the suffering? When are laws relating to child labour detrimental to family welfare? To what extent is our motivation affected by self-interest rather than altruism?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the challenge for Australia is to hold steadfastly to what we know to be good in our own practice; to propound it with firm politeness and self-assurance; and to listen, debate and discuss the insights of our neighbours with open curiosity as to the true nature of their experience. Central to the effective protection of human rights is the rule of law. This needs some explanation as there is no shortage of legislation in the world, much of it high sounding. By the rule of law, I mean law that is made by democratically elected assemblies; laws interpreted by an independent judiciary; and laws executed by police forces with high ethical standards, uncorrupted by the wealthy and the powerful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the separation of powers that underlies this is a particular device of Western political theory, the justice that it ensures is universally understood and universally desired. Therefore, Australia's efforts to promote the rule of law&mdash;whether it be through the aid program, through the work of the International Commission of Jurists, through the defence cooperation program or through peacemaking&mdash;is to be applauded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee took 81 hours of evidence at public hearings. As was to be expected, there has been comment, most of it favourable, but some critical, such as the comment from Senator Kemp. Senator Kemp's criticism of the report, made in the Senate on Monday, was an exercise in overstatement, a distortion of any argument. No doubt his criticism emanated from his dissatisfaction with the fact that the committee did not accept many of the assumptions underlying his submission. In the debate on Monday, in the Senate, he claimed that the report showed that there were serious problems with the treaty making procedures. This is not so. The report believed there were minor adjustments that could be made to the process and that some existing processes could be streamlined, not only by the Commonwealth but also by the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kemp denigrates the government's enormous enthusiasm for treaties as if it is an evil plot by an evil empire. This, I think, says more about his own conspiratorial outlook on the world. The number of treaties is a reflection of the interconnectedness of the modern world. Therefore, what he describes as a sovereignty problem conceded in the first report was not that at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That committee, of which I was a member, did not believe there was a sovereignty problem. It saw the limitations on national sovereignty rather as matters of fact, an inevitable consequence of an interdependent world, and the extended accountability beyond the usual domestic constituency as a necessary, useful and valuable thing in a world so bedevilled by many governments' abuse of their citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be noted here that the limitations on national sovereignty remain voluntary acts of nation states. In the human rights area, they need never impinge on states whose laws are sound and whose record of protection of the rights of citizens is thoroughgoing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current report does not dismiss the notion of sovereignty. It considered the arguments carefully. It agreed with Senator Kemp that it was preferable that the human rights complaints of Australians be dealt with by Australian courts. Hence it recommended the consideration of the introduction of a bill of rights to complement the ICCRP in Australian law and thereby circumvent any need for Australian citizens to take complaints to the Human Rights Committee in Geneva. Good national practice is the aim of human rights treaties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the quoted passages of the views of Sir Ninian Stephen alert us to the dangers inherent in any international system, Sir Ninian, nevertheless, appeared to accept, as does the report, the necessary and beneficial aspects of internationalism. The comments of Sir Ninian are as much a confirmation of as a contrast to those of the committee. The committee too believes it is timely that parliament be involved in the treaty making process, and we have said so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee addressed seriously all the questions on the role of parliament, the role of states and the consultative mechanisms. It neither lacked courage nor ignored the issues. However, the evidence before the committee did not confirm the position put to it by Senator Kemp. The states were consulted on treaties and often included delegations for negotiations of treaties. It seemed to the committee that the fault, if fault there be, of any failure to understand the importance of treaties lay as much in the mechanisms and the efforts made at the state government level as at the Commonwealth government level. It also appeared to the committee that on occasions state governments which had been parties to the process chose to deny their responsibilities for parochial political reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comments made by people regarding the United Nations are also interesting. I listened with great interest to what the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) said about this earlier. People speak of the United Nations as an entity, as an `it'. The United Nations is a collection of sovereign states, not an entity in its own right. If a change to the United Nations system is needed, and it could well be, the ability to do so lies with the sovereign states who make up its membership. As I say, I have no argument with the view that the United Nations needs to be streamlined but, if it is going to be streamlined, it will be the sovereign states who make up its membership. It will not be the United Nations itself&mdash;not the `it'&mdash;but the entity of the sovereign states which makes up its membership which will put this streamline process into action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A word needs to be said about the minority view at the end of the report which the right honourable member for New England also mentioned. I make this comment not because it is a substantial or considered document but because the tone of it is highly offensive. It is full of simplistic, self-righteousness and smug condescension&mdash;the kind of thing that gives human rights a bad name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two particular areas I will comment on: the committee process and politics. Senator Margetts's comments on what the committee did not do purport to be the comments of an insider to the workings of the Human Rights Subcommittee. This was not so. She did not attend any of the hundreds of hours of meetings and briefings of the committee. She did not listen to the evidence nor did she participate in the discussions on how the committee would approach the masses of information it received in the limited time frame and with very limited resources. Failure to participate in the work of an inquiry usually causes most members of the joint committee to be a little circumspect and reticent in any comments they make at the end of the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Human Rights Subcommittee is asked to review Australian government policy, not the human rights circumstances of the world. Senator Margetts's complaints about what was not covered are ignorant of the terms of reference and the evidence. They are ignorant of the committee process, which is confined to specific evidence presented to it and to a very limited time frame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A committee inquiry is to look at what is and how that might be moved within the political framework that we have. It is a reflection of the views of those Australians who choose to put in submissions and the committee's response to them. If views are not forthcoming, the committee cannot invent them. It was always possible for Senator Margetts to put in a submission to the committee on matters of concern to her. Other senators did. When Senator Margetts was asked to provide a recommendation on the rights of women, which she complained was not there, it was not provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Her arguments on defence cooperation and trade, as with much of her paper, are high on sentiment and low on logic. She claims that too much attention has been given to them&mdash;300 to 400 words in 100,000 words. It is simply untrue to suggest that the committee saw them as ends in themselves. They are considered in the report only as they contribute or otherwise to the promotion of human rights. If, as she claims, defence force regimes are the chief perpetrators of human rights abuses, all the more reason to inform them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On questions of particular human rights situations in other parts of the world, Senator Margetts reveals something of her own methodology. It lacks academic and political wisdom. The committee was not in a position to make definitive pronouncements. To suggest that an Australian parliamentary committee, with a staff of two, should solicit information about every human rights violation around the world, assess it, verify it, and write about it, as well as deal with the terms of reference of the committee to review Australian government policy, all in the space of a year, is nothing short of ludicrous. Bougainville and Burma have been and will be the subject of specific reports by the committee. Without specific inquiry, the committee was not prepared to make extensive comment and confined itself deliberately to thematic commentary based on some of the incidents which some Australians brought to its attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Margetts condemns the document as a political document. Who does she think she is? Where does she think she is from? Politics is about compromise. The alternative is bomb throwing. It is politics and political compromises which in our type of country have moved the social agenda peacefully, not always evenly but relentlessly, towards a better life for most citizens. Politics is about keeping your eyes on your agenda, your own constituency, the demands of your party, the strength of the opposition; it is about persuading and cajoling, often in the chamber with aggression, but in committees with humour and with tact. It is about getting what you can for the moment and moving on from there next time. In particular, it is not about alienating those who might be your supporters but about knowing when you have won something. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course there were compromises in some areas. I wanted the report to go further once or twice and sometimes I thought we went too far, but, like all other members of the Human Rights Subcommittee, I wanted, if possible, a unanimous report which could encompass the very diverse views of the members who sat through hours of hearings, read thousands of words of submissions, and who each in their own way have a definite and for most of us a longstanding commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights. All of the committee members serve on other committees, but for most of us this was the most important, as we are dealing with the rights of people, including in some cases the right to life. A real difficulty for all of us is that we do not have the time to do all we have wanted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are those who will criticise the report, but I believe it has been an outstanding report. I said previously that human rights is fraught with obstacles, hypocrisy, national interest and ideological conflicts. In spite of these problems, the progress of global human rights has been advanced through the actions and dreams of individuals. The struggle for the need to observe human rights, despite the various international conventions, continues in many countries around the world. These include those who adopted them but as yet are unable or unwilling to implement the full extent of these rights within their domains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pursuing the question of which rights are universal is a fruitless exercise, since all civilised states have accepted the need for them, as seen in the appointment of the UN Commissioner for Human Rights. The real problem is the perception of dominance and power between alignments of states and perhaps an unwillingness of states to accept the changing post-Cold War world. It remains to be said that a number of differences have more to do with the struggle, both domestic and international, for political power and influence between the players than the issue of human rights per se. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The primary aim in achieving human rights or dignity should be seen as a struggle for achieving justice in every country. If all countries are committed to the idea that human rights are evolving and justice is the ultimate aim, it is not unlikely that a common set of rights will eventually evolve for all mankind. Perhaps that is an unrealistic dream, but it is one certainly worth striving for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to pay a particular tribute to the chair of the committee, Senator Loosley, who brought a real commitment to the protection of human rights to the committee. If we think the other committee members put in many hours, Senator Loosley put in more than most. The person the greatest tribute should go to is Margaret Swieringa. We all say how many submissions we read. She read and analysed them all for us. For one person, with a support staff, to be mainly responsible for the report is nothing short of outstanding. I pay tribute to the outstanding role that Margaret Swieringa played during the many hours of hearing and the compilation of the report. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I am delighted to have this opportunity provided today to comment on the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A review of Australia's efforts to promote and protect human rights</EMPHASIS> that was tabled earlier this week in the House of Representatives. Before I move on to the specific recommendations that I would like to talk about this morning, I would like to make two introductory remarks. Firstly, I would like to support fully the comments of my colleague the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) in his criticism of the minority report that has been reported by Senator Margetts. I agree with all of his comments. I believe that the way in which Senator Margetts has written the minority report and the contents of it are totally inappropriate and unreasonable.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I would like to join with him in congratulating the chair of the committee, Senator Stephen Loosley, who has done an outstanding job. I did not get to participate in as many of the hearings as I would have liked, but I attended a number. Participating in hearings of the Human Rights Subcommittee is a very difficult process. Hour after hour, day after day we were presented with some very gruesome stories about abuses of human rights, suffering and torture that are occurring around the world and the struggles that a lot of people have around the world. It can be an extremely painful and difficult process listening to what is happening around the world and seeing the suffering that a lot of people face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Loosley, as chair, demonstrated an enormous amount of compassion, concern and sincere commitment to human rights in all of those hearings. He also had a great deal of fortitude in being able to stay there day after day, hearing after hearing, listening to all of the evidence and continuing to be a very strong supporter and a very compassionate person. My sincere congratulations go to Senator Loosley. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also join with the honourable member for Throsby in supporting his comments about Margaret Swieringa, who has done an outstanding job. The greatest credit a person can give to Margaret is the fact that this document is a very substantial report. It adds to the significant body of evidence and information about human rights and the important role Australia can play in promoting human rights. It will be recognised internationally as a substantial document, not only because of its size, with 63 recommendations and 350 pages, but also because the content of it is very important and valuable. The recommendations are very sensible, sound recommendations that will advance the cause of human rights if they are all implemented, and I sincerely hope they will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of minor clarifications that we need to make in a couple of the recommendations. I have been asked to make them. They are only very small points but I would like to get their clarification on the public record. The first is in chapter 7, where we are talking about Aboriginal concerns; there is a word left out in recommendation No. 30. We said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Aboriginal communities are encouraged to mobilise local skills and resources in cooperation with neighbouring communities and other people who are available to train Aborigines within a community: and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.by way of improving and increasing resources to outback communities, the Commonwealth Government encourage the private sector and/or NGOs to sponsor workers . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The word that is left out is `environmental'. It should have continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in the fields of environmental health, education, building or community development . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Our concern was to support and increase the number of environmental health workers that are available in Aboriginal communities to assist in things such as: cleaning up drainage and rubbish disposal on local communities; constructing housing; supplying appropriate sources of water; making sure water supplies are kept clean&mdash;things like that. So the workers were to be environmental health workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second clarification I would like to make is with recommendation No. 32. It concerns the lack of ability for Aboriginal people to access banking facilities in a lot of communities. They are not able to deposit their moneys, establish savings accounts, manage their affairs like Aboriginal people or any other Australians are able to do in provincial cities or metropolitan areas. The committee has recommended that the government investigate, and the words in the recommendation are `credit facilities'. That is a little misleading. We are not actually suggesting that they should be given credit facilities&mdash;access or capacity to borrow money&mdash;but we are suggesting they should have the capacity to save and bank money and to have access to normal banking facilities. So we are in fact referring to saving and banking facilities in recommendation No. 32. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, there were 63 recommendations in this report and I cannot comment on all of them, much as I would like to. There are about half a dozen recommendations I would like to draw to the attention of the Main Committee and the government because I believe these are important ones. The first one I would like to talk about is recommendation No. 5. It refers to the committee's support for the concept of a United Nations parliamentary assembly. One of my other jobs in this parliament is to convene a group called Parliamentarians for Global Action which is&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Hollis" NAMEID="DH4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr Hollis</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You do it very well indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ST4">Mr GIBSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. It is a group of international parliamentarians from some 70 countries around the world. They have a strong belief that, side by side with the General Assembly, which is the coming together of the government representatives of all of the nations which are members of the United Nations, we need to have a parliamentary assembly that can operate to give advice to those government representatives and to the United Nations organisations about what the political representatives of the peoples of the world think about the various issues that are facing the United Nations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not suggesting in any way that that should undermine the authority or the sovereignty of the nations that make up the United Nations because I understand that it is a council of sovereign nations; but I do believe that it would be a very valuable source of advice, information and support for the United Nations. It would ensure not only that there were better ideas flowing into the United Nations about what the peoples of the world think should happen and how we should be dealing with peace and disarmament, environmental degradation and all those other important issues, but also it would go the other way and help improve the knowledge about the United Nations and the work of the United Nations in those parliaments and in those nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By being there at the United Nations General Assembly, by having their own assembly, by being able to contribute to those debates, parliamentarians could then come back to their national parliaments and better inform their colleagues and tell the peoples they represent what the United Nations is doing and what role ordinary people can play. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I think the support for a United Nations parliamentary assembly is very important. I think it has widespread support amongst the parliaments around the world. I know that next year, with the 50th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, the Inter-Parliamentary Union is having its conference as a parliamentary assembly at the United Nations. It will be held in the United Nations during the General Assembly. I hope that this will be the forerunner of many such annual parliamentary assemblies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer now to recommendations 10 and 11, which concern the process of better informing this parliament of our work on human rights and our capacity as a nation to achieve our obligations under UN treaties and conventions. Recommendation No. 10 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Government table in the Parliament the reports (detailed at Table 2.2 of this report) prepared by the various Commonwealth agencies in response to our obligations under UN human rights treaties.</PARA>
<PARA>We are a signatory to the United Nations human rights conventions and to a number of covenants&mdash;the civil and political covenant and the economic, social and cultural covenant. Every couple of years Australia is required to report to the United Nations on our achievement of those aims. We must report what we are doing as a country to ensure that our people get those rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this parliament, which is the democratic forum of the people of this nation, does not actually see those reports. There is no debate in parliament about what is in those reports. There is no debate about what our nation is telling the international community we are doing to fulfil our human rights obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is important to ensure that the people of this nation and their parliamentary representatives have an opportunity to consider what the government has submitted and to debate that, so I strongly support that recommendation. I also strongly support recommendation No. 11, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Government reinstate the regular human rights reports from all Australian diplomatic posts and urges the Government to make provision in resources and training for officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to carry out the task.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a very important initiative. Our government does not put together a report like that from our diplomatic posts around the world. Such a report would help us as parliamentarians. It would also help Australians to better understand what is happening around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were able to pull together, on an annual or a two-yearly basis, a report about what is happening around the world, Australians travelling overseas would know what was happening in each country. They would know the human rights records of various countries, and they would have a better idea of whether they should be dealing with or visiting those countries. We may well then be able to avoid some of the tragedies that we have had in the past with Australian nationals losing their lives because of terrorist activities or abuses of human rights in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a report would ensure that all our government departments could be better informed in their dealings with other countries. They would have a clearer understanding of the human rights records in various countries. A number of countries, including the US, already prepare such a report on an annual basis. Those countries thus have a very important tool in the form of regular reports from their diplomatic posts. Australia should encourage that as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation No. 14 is another important recommendation. It suggests that this subcommittee should be converted into a full joint standing committee. Criticism is often heard in this place&mdash;and I believe it is justified&mdash;that there are too many committees in the parliament. We all suffer from the fact that we are on too many committees and so we do not have enough time to concentrate on the issues that we think are important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, human rights is an issue that this parliament should not ignore. In recommending a full joint committee on human rights, we are not adding to the number of committees but merely giving the current subcommittee the status of a full committee. The major impact of that would be to ensure that we have better resources to enable the committee to do its work. As has already been stated in this chamber this morning, Margaret Swieringa has virtually produced this report single handed. Apart from the very valuable assistance that she has had from one or two people from time to time, she has had to carry a huge workload. If it were a full joint standing committee, she would have three or four research staff to support her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing is more important to Australia's international standing than our obligations to observe human rights and to promote human rights around the world. We need to resource the committee more adequately so that we, as a parliament, can contribute to the promotion of human rights in a more forthright manner and so that our committee can do its work fully. I very strongly support the recommendation that the human rights subcommittee be converted to a full joint standing committee. We have already, as a subcommittee, discussed the ways in which we could ensure that that occurred with minimal disruption and so that there was still full cooperation between the human rights committee and the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only other comment I would like to make is in relation to comments that the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) made regarding East Timor. As the member for Throsby said, our recommendation is one of compromise, but it is a reasonable compromise. I would have gone a lot further. I am a person who has said consistently in this parliament that I disagree with successive Australian governments' position on East Timor. I do not believe we should have recognised the incorporation of East Timor into Indonesia. I believe it was an act of invasion and an act of violence against the rights of the people of East Timor. I believe that the Indonesians should leave East Timor and let East Timorese decide for themselves what their future should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I think the recommendation in this report is an important first step. What should happen is that the Indonesians should reduce their military presence in that country significantly. They should give the East Timorese an opportunity to administer themselves and to decide for themselves their own future. I commend this report to the Main Committee and I hope the government will support all the recommendations. </PARA>

The changes are typographical, apart from the elimination of recommendation 10, which was inadvertently duplicated. Any reprint of the report should contain these alterations.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KH4">Mr BARRY JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Committee. Of the 271 submissions received, over 90 per cent advocated population stability or lower population growth. Less than 10 per cent of submissions argued for an increase in population. On both sides extreme views were expressed. On the population reduction side, a few submissions argued that the present population should be encouraged to dwindle to as low as seven million, one million or until it equalled the estimated indigenous population of Australia before 1788. But the opposite and extreme figures of 80 or 100 million were cited as desirable possibilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the overwhelming majority of submissions provided statements of opinion rather than analyses of the issues covered by the terms of reference, about 10 per cent of the total provided detailed analytical surveys of a range of economic, demographic, ecological or other issues related to Australia's population carrying capacity. Of these, 15 were from academics and scientists with an identified institutional affiliation, and others were from government departments, scientific professional associations, policy research associations and environmental organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While most submissions simply nominated population targets within what was seen as a desirable range, and did not attempt to provide any analysis of the factors that must be considered in an evaluation of national carrying capacity, there was recognition on the part of scientific and academic contributors, including the CSIRO, that any analysis which took account of a sufficient range of relevant factors would necessarily be extremely complex. In order to obtain more evidence on the range of economic and scientific issues which provided insights into the question of Australia's carrying capacity, the committee examined 23 witnesses representative of a wide range of expertise and community opinion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee concluded that Australia's politically and socially realistic population options may be confined to four which deserve serious, ongoing, well-informed community debate. The options are: first, relatively high population growth, with a figure by the middle of next century of between 30 and 50 million; second, a moderate population growth option resulting in a figure of between 23 and 30 million; third, a stabilisation option of a figure of between 17 to 23 million; and, four, a moderate reduction option which would see population reduced to between five and 17 million by mid next century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The option with the strongest community support is clearly that of population stabilisation by the middle of the next century of around 23 million. This figure could readily be achieved by imposing a net migration target of 50,000 a year. However, the committee was not prepared to recommend a specific upper limit, recognising that public perceptions about acceptable levels change from time to time and should be the subject of ongoing community debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In chapter 3, `Challenging mythologies about population and quality of life', the committee identified and discussed 12 of the most familiar misconceptions about population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tables and maps in the report provide useful comparative data. As the tables on pages 29 and 31 indicate, Australia ranks ahead of the US in annual internal renewable water resources per capita, but is well behind Canada, and in annual freshwater withdrawals per capita it is behind the US and Canada but well ahead of Japan, Turkey, Vietnam and Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As paragraph 2.25 points out, the soil-climate homologues for the 80 per cent of Australia classified as arid or semi-arid are, like much of Africa, incapable of sustainably supporting any form of agricultural production other than extensive pastoralism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph 2.26 says that, conversely, the better-watered 20 per cent of the continent is capable of supporting agricultural crop and pasture systems analogous to those of western Europe and north America. That is not to say that the higher rainfall areas of Australia could support farming populations at the same density as western Europe or the mid-west of the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The immediate reasons for this are that Australian soils were infertile by world standards and the Australian climate highly variable. While Australia has a very high level of arable land per capita by world standards, 2.8 hectares versus a world average of 0.33 hectares, the quality of Australian arable land is low and big population increases would soon reduce our quality corrected area of crop land per head towards the world average. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The quality of public debate on population matters is another important issue tackled in the committee's inquiry. Again, it is an issue which has arisen partly from the public confusion over the role of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in relation to population matters. Some submissions argued a lack of confidence in the objectivity and independence of research conducted by the Bureau of Immigration and Population Research with respect to the long-term effects of immigration, and on population research generally. Serious gaps in the material published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on population matters were also identified. However, the quality of the ABT data is commended and its work is regarded as authoritative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To make informed judgments on the range of matters relevant to population policy, it is necessary not only to conduct research into a range of environmental reporting and social trends data but to identify sources which provide such data and to ensure that it is readily accessible to the wider public. Information needs to be kept up to date for summaries of demographic data and relevant population projections available as a form of published annual or biennial reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear from evidence to the committee that the perceived absence of independently produced, publicly available research data, including demographic projections, resource assessment and quality of life data, has directly inhibited the quality of public debate and has by default encouraged views expressing extremes of optimism and pessimism among participants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is essential to recognise that what may be `desirable' in terms of population size must not be confused with what is `feasible' or politically and socially achievable. In other words, population is a political issue and must be dealt with by political means, not by pretending that it is too difficult and ignoring it altogether. By making evidence available and by improving the quality and objectivity of population research, debate on the issue may concentrate on realistic and acceptable alternatives for a population policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has, as the committee's report explains, always had a bipartisan approach to immigration policy, but there have been fluctuations in the community's tolerance of migrants at different times and intake levels have always varied according to current perceptions of Australia's requirements and obligations. Governments have always operated on the basis of a reasonable degree of community consensus, indicated by the degree of bipartisanship achieved. We should not abandon this approach. This view is reflected in the committee's conclusion that Australia would do well to adopt a precautionary position with regard to population policy in accordance with principles of ecologically sustainable development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was concerned about the rise of irrationalism in politics, some with a green tinge, especially the recent phenomenon which links concern for preserving the environment with a strongly racist, anti-migrant mood, something which has arisen in Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Australia. This tends to make migrants a scapegoat and raises a false or exaggerated dichotomy: there can be wilderness, unspoiled rivers and unpolluted beaches or migrants, but not both. It is a gross oversimplification. It also diverts attention away from where it ought to be: on proper resource management, improved waste disposal, energy efficiency, rethinking the real, social cost of water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we should oppose the rigidity that asserts that immigration is the only variable to worry about in considering environmental impact, leading to a fatalism that existing practices will go on unchanged and that technologies such as recycling, water conservation and energy efficiency will not improve the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was also sceptical about the argument of a direct correlation between population growth, loss of biodiversity and deforestation, that is, population growth in isolation. In 3.18 the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As pointed out in the CSIRO submission to the Inquiry, the most ruthless devastation of Australian forests occurred in the 19th century when population increases were comparatively limited (i.e. when the population rose from 2 to 5 million). Biodiversity is a current term used to describe the variousness of life forms and the variety of ways in which that life is organised into ecosystems. Loss of biodiversity is a reference to the fact that many plant and animal species have become extinct in Australia since European settlement.</PARA>
<PARA>In 3.19, the report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Loss of habitat&mdash;transformation of places where plants and animals live&mdash;is well recognised as the main cause of biodiversity loss. All land use intensification causes habitat loss, including urbanisation and the laying down of infrastructure. Land use intensification is strongly associated in peoples' perception with population growth. It is also strongly associated with the development of agriculture and forestry. For example, the loss of many mammal species in the rangelands has paralleled the spread of pastoralism, an activity supporting only sparse human population. The causal relationship between these two factors is complicated by associated factors such as the decline of Aboriginal `firestick farming.'</PARA>
<PARA>Feral animals have been the cause of biocide and their operation has little, if any, connection with population growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chapter 5, `World population growth and Australian population policy', attempts to place the national situation in a context of the world population explosion, the subject of the Cairo conference. The extreme pressure of population in such countries as Bangladesh and much of Africa revives the spectre of the Reverend Thomas Malthus. His dire warnings, 200 years after publication, are starting to seem realistic in the Third World. Are they applicable to Australia as well? The committee was doubtful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless it is clear that population can no longer be regarded as a national issue only. Australia's policy response must be formulated in the global context of a worldwide population explosion. At Cairo, Australia gave explicit support to the principle that all nations have a responsibility to stabilise their populations as soon as possible, and accepted that we can continue to assist developing countries with non-coercive family planning programs, and through our refugee program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's recommendation No. 9 was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Australian Government continue to make it clear that Australia's contribution for assisting the problems of global overpopulation will be a combination of aid, expertise and example, pointing out that reduced fertility rates have a close relationship with encouraging education for girls and women and with rising levels of prosperity. In addition, Australia must improve its efforts to reduce the impact of global pollution, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to thank the members of the committee, all those who prepared submissions and gave evidence and all those who worked so hard in contributing to the report, especially the committee's faithful, conscientious, expert, overworked and patient staff. The report is and should remain a valuable resource document in the ongoing debate about Australia's population. </PARA>

One of the great criticisms of politicians of this country is that we look only from election to election, so it was a delight to participate in this inquiry and enjoy the many opportunities provided as we looked out over the horizon a little and contemplated what the population of the country might be. In his press club speech the member for Lalor referred to Griffith Taylor and the fact that he got it pretty right in 1922. Let us hope that our report is as accurate 70 years hence and that we have done our nation a service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, governments have the responsibility to monitor and plan for our population. The system at the moment is too ad hoc. We cannot continue to rely on luck and chance, chopping and changing our policy every year. We need a long-term view, particularly if we are to wisely use our natural resources and maintain our liberal democratic processes. The committee found that the most likely optimum population for Australia is 23 million. We have said that immigration policy is different from population policy, and our chairman has noted the irrationality which has come into our political debate from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Presently, our population clings to the coasts of Australia and our cities. We have an urban and regional culture, and it was noted that many of the submissions had that green tinge. I suppose it was a pleasure to work in the committee and find that all the submissions were respected for the effort that had gone into them but at the same time we stayed within a fairly strict framework of objectivity and professionalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chairman noted that the main environmental damage to this country was done in the last century, and that is something that should be highlighted in this report. Those people who may care to study the report in depth will note that chapter 1, `History of population and population debate in Australia' is very comprehensive. For someone like me who is relatively new in the parliament it has been a wonderful opportunity to look at our past because it is only by looking at our past, as we all know, that we understand where we are at now and develop a better future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In chapter 2 the committee considers the continental `carrying capacity' of Australia. `Stocking capacity' was, as the chairman acknowledged from time to time, a little crude, but that is what we were trying to come to terms with. In that comparative assessment we have gone to some lengths to look at environmental issues and international comparisons. For example, we have touched on the Murray-Darling Basin, a quite critical part of our Australian environmental and economic situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee considered everything from the rangelands to the high rainfall zones and land degradation, which has assumed a prominence in political debate over the last decade or so. Salinisation, acidification, weeds and feral animals are all dealt with as part of the impact on land degradation. We look at the prospects for Australian agriculture and acknowledge that the long-term future of Australia as a food supplier is quite important internationally and very important nationally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chapter 3, where we deal with challenging mythologies about population and quality of life, gets into a little bit more subjectivity and is perhaps a little closer to some of the political debates that the chair has referred to and that vary from time to time. Nevertheless, it deals with the subject with the objectivity and professionalism which I believe serves the parliament well and will serve the country well. It does lay down quite clearly the basis of our considerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chapter 4 is entitled `The role of information in the population debate'. There is an unlimitable and unlimited amount of data available on this subject but this chapter tries very hard to come to terms with relevant data from international sources and from within our own country, and looks at the research questions in all of these debates. Research is very important in that it gives us the opportunity to look out over the horizon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next chapter is about world population growth and Australian population policy. Australia presents the great advantage that, living under a stable democratic institution, we have the luxury of being able to consider these things with professional support and it is open to every member of the Australian community to be able to consider this. When we look at what happens in the international community, we become more aware of the privilege of living in this country. It is a little ironical to me that we&mdash;particularly the non-Aboriginal component of our population&mdash;with a chequered past in terms of understanding our environment as we settled this country, coming to terms with our mistakes and learning to deal with the issues on a day-by-day basis, still have the opportunity in this report to understand that and look to the future with great confidence and optimism. That is part of the ongoing institution&mdash;I suppose I seem to be labouring the point&mdash;which I am proud to be part of as part of my heritage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chair has covered what the submissions said about population size. It was quite valuable for me, in the open, formal component of the inquiry, that those people had the opportunity to come forward and present their opinions direct to the committee and that I could listen and ask questions about which direction we might take. I remember particularly the one million population option, which highlighted to me the great diversity of opinion that is out there in our community. The chapter on options for population policy has been well covered by the chair. A great effort was made to try to understand what the future consumption and population policy would be from the perspective of the Aboriginals, the original settlers of our continent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to my roots, I suppose, in noting that Australia's agricultural production and exports have doubled, while the area of land farmed has gone up by 16 per cent, with fewer people working those bigger farms. That is an example, if ever there was one, of the movement of population out of rural Australia and into the regional cities and into the cities of Australia. One witness in particular said that cities have a great capacity to regenerate; they are the preferred place of living for the overwhelming majority of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite some of the mythology surrounding regional Australia, this highlights the great variation over 100 years, where we do not know what is ahead of us. Fifty years ago, say, there were comparatively a lot of people out in regional Australia. Although so many of them have come into cities, even through the changes&mdash;the technology and all the rest of it&mdash;population growth has occurred quite safely and the quality of life has been protected. That highlights the moves and changes which our environment can accommodate with intelligence and the technological advances that are available to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the remaining three or four minutes that I have, I wish to touch on what we might look for from the youth of this nation. As I have stated at least twice, this report lays down professionally and in a bipartisan way the population capacity of our country. It is not being too prescriptive: it is being realistic and practical in the way it has dealt with the various components of the debate. Australia is a world leader in its democratic institutions and in its intellectual property and the way we make our decisions, which gives us every confidence of being a strong democracy into the 21st century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To those young people who will be looking back on this report and making some judgment on us&mdash;as I have had the good fortune to do, through the good offices of our chairman, on Griffith Taylor, who, in 1922, estimated that the population would be 20 million about now&mdash;I would say that a doomsday philosophy has been about for too long. We have every reason, based on reports such as this, to be confident and optimistic. I do not say, nor do I think any member of the committee would, that this report is the be-all and end-all of the debate. I suggest that the chairman would agree with me that it is but a good basis for the beginning of the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would ask the young people of Australia that we be judged in the fullness of time&mdash;over the next 30 or 40 years&mdash;to see how close we have got. I have every confidence that our report will not have been exactly accurate, but I have equal confidence that it is an excellent base to build on with confidence and optimism&mdash;because I have that sort of confidence in my country and its people. With those few words&mdash;and with grateful acknowledgment of our staff, who with great diligence, patience and effort have given the committee wonderful support, and with whom it has been a pleasure to work, along with other members of the committee&mdash;I hope that those who read the report will gain from it what they would like to gain, and that it will serve the country well into the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The breadth of optimism contained in the speech of the chairman of the Standing Committee for Long Term Strategies, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), and in the words of the honourable member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) is very welcome in this parliament, particularly on this subject. In congratulating members of the committee, I would particularly mention the chairman, who is a great academic and a great political leader, and who has had a great career in administration in this parliament as a minister. He is someone who has the capacity to assimilate information from a wide range of fields in science and technology. For that reason, he has been of great benefit. I believe that many of the reports from this committee will be important reports in Australia's history, and I congratulate him on that. I also commend my colleagues on the committee for their involvement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention the staff too. An inquiry like this has not been all that easy for the staff, and they have fed into the committee and performed really well. I did not mention that the chair can be pretty exacting, and I believe the staff did respond to the pressures that must come from the chair as he seeks to have a near perfect report. Even now he is finding items that he can correct in the report, I noticed. But we have come up with a very good report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will look at recommendation 15 for a start. It is recommended that Australia should commission a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of developing technologies which reduce environmental impacts, for example, soil and water conservation technologies and capital intensive agricultural technologies such as greenhouse and hydroponic production. Australia has always had, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, from your own electorate, a great advantage in climate over other countries of the world in our production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This struck me when I was in Sweden about two months after the Chernobyl disaster. As we were going through Sweden in the middle of the summer, with beautiful, lush pasture, there were no animals to be seen. When I asked where all the animals were, I was told they were all locked up in their winter sheds. It was very convenient for Sweden after Chernobyl that people could lock all their livestock up. We would not be able to do that in Australia. With our hundreds of millions of sheep and other livestock, we just would not be able to do it. It did impress me then that in the winter some people have to accommodate their animals to an extent that we do not here. I asked myself whether Sweden and other countries will catch up with Australia with some of the developments in agricultural technologies on concentrated production&mdash;fish farming, for instance, and hydroponic production. Even here I think our climate is still an advantage, because with our temperature ranges we will have fewer energy costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go to recommendation 14, where we recommend that the Australian government should encourage state and local governments, as a matter of high priority, to encourage development of sewerage and waste disposal systems that reduce the use of pristine water and/or environmentally sensitive land areas, and promote recycling. People have been coming to me and probably to other honourable members for some time now saying, `Why do we not do something with our sewage and our waste from cities like Melbourne, Sydney, Canberra, Adelaide, Perth, Darwin, Brisbane and Hobart?' Just recently a more feasible program, called liquid trees, has actually been developed in my own region. It draws on some of the technologies which are already available, including the transport of coal over quite long distances. Apparently coal can be transferred through pipes with the use of not a lot of energy, and it has been suggested that there are ways, under the liquid trees proposal, of making better use of the water involved with our sewage and waste disposal and diverting that water inland. It is the best such proposal I have seen so far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As members, we are asked time and again why we cannot do what seems to people to be the obvious, and it is easy to respond, `This is just like turning the rivers backwards and that sort of thing, and the Snowy Mountains scheme could never happen again in Australia because of environmental pressures.' It is easy to respond like that, but we ought to look carefully at some of the proposals that come to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to comment on a few of the recommendations. I particularly emphasise recommendation 1, that the government should determine that population policy and immigration policy are quite distinct, with different goals. That is very important. As I see it, we should regard immigration as an instrument of population growth, and we have not been doing that. We have been making ad hoc decisions. There is pressure from the public and we make decisions almost annually on what our immigration level should be. The point made by the report is that immigration and population growth should be regarded as distinct. Recommendation 7(b) of the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Bureau of Immigration and Population Research be renamed as the Bureau of Population Research and transferred to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet to service the proposed Cabinet Committee on Population.</PARA>
<PARA>It is suggested that a cabinet committee on population be formed with its own research budget of at least $1 million annually to fund scientific research programs to enable more informed, evidence based analysis of population policy options. We say in recommendation 12:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While emphasising that immigration policy is only one aspect of a national population policy, proponents of radical change to existing policy and practice in immigration intake should bear the burden of proof.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that is very important. We have maintained the status of immigration as it was in 1961, when about 16 per cent of people were prepared to say outright that immigration should be reduced. We are sticking to that sort of status here in the parliament, and we have consideration of immigration almost equal to our consideration of what we are doing about our population&mdash;whether we ought to have growth or otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to mention that the report highlights the proper place of immigration: as an instrument, not as an end in itself. It has been shown quite clearly in the report that, while there may be an effect from immigration on the cost of living, it could be marginally beneficial. There may also be an effect on the environment, but the effect is not nearly as great as both the proponents and opponents of increased immigration claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another recommendation that ought to be mentioned is recommendation 10, which suggests that we ought to be asking what the incremental effects downstream are. That is very important. The recommendation says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government should develop a population policy which explicitly sets out a range of options for long term population change, emphasising that year by year decisions on immigration intake cannot be taken in an <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">ad hoc</EMPHASIS> fashion.</PARA>
<PARA>In recommendation 11 we look at something quite different: a consumption strategy. The report recommends that we adopt a consumption strategy such that we think about the benefits of modifying our behaviour and use of products&mdash;modifying our behaviour in the purchase of products and in the disposal of products as well. It is important that we develop a consumption strategy, because if we do that nationally then it is going to permeate our education system. We have shown on environmental issues and on racial tolerance issues that we as parliaments around Australia are not bad at influencing the education system. Schoolteachers quite often take up the lead that thinking people in the parliament can provide to them. As the recommendation here in the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia should adopt a consumption strategy, to be developed around the challenge of learning to move from high levels of consumption based on high levels of material throughput per unit of consumption to lower levels of consumption based on lower levels of material throughput per unit of consumption. Such a strategy need not reduce quality of life&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>an important point to note&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">although it may change the way in which people enjoy quality lives.</PARA>
<PARA>The report also looks at some of the myths involved&mdash;and I must admit that I was guilty of believing some of them myself. As myths often can, these do have a degree of truth in some cases. For instance, one is that Australia has one of the world's most serious shortages of water. We actually have the water; the real problem is the price of getting it places. We show in paragraph 3.2 that Australia is one of the better endowed countries in the world for water, but the water is not in areas where people live. About two-thirds of all the run-off is in the northern fifth of the country, where it is difficult to store water cheaply because of the lack of good dam sites and the high variability of rainfall. It is not clear whether Australians would want to pay the price of getting a lot more water to places where it is needed to cope with population change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another myth is that Australia is just a big desert, unsuitable for human settlement. It seems pretty evident that it is true that high density subsistence populations are not an option for most of the rangelands in Australia. We looked at the issue of environmental degradation&mdash;for example, salinity and blue-green algae in the Murray-Darling Basin&mdash;and whether it is due to the population size and the rate of growth. It seems, and it is shown in our report, that the problem of blue-green algae outbreaks in the Murray-Darling river system is partly due to increasing inputs of phosphates in the sewerage system as the population in the Murray-Darling Basin rises. It is also partly due to the use of phosphate fertilisers at levels recommended more by technology choice than by the population in the basin. The CSIRO gave us evidence in relation to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a view that loss of biodiversity and the deforestation are directly related to the size of the population and its rate of growth. I can recall reading something of the words of Strzelecki&mdash;or, as the Poles pronounce it, `Streletzki'&mdash;when he visited the Kosciusko area or, as the Poles pronounce it, `Kozchusko'. When he saw the Monaro frost plains, which did not have many trees, he said that there could well be problems with hoofed animals and with the axe where there were trees&mdash;in other words, the removing of trees from the few places where there were trees. The word `Monaro' comes from the Aboriginal word `maneroo', which means `maidens' breasts': the plains were undulating hills. The early explorers wrote back to London and Sydney and said, `Here is good clean country,' which meant they did not have to chop down a whole lot of trees. Sure enough, the hoofed animals came and did quite a lot of damage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are concerned about the actions of people. If we could think about productivity and sustainability more than population, we would be targeting the problem a bit better. Naturally none of us can cover all of the report but, once again, I pay compliments to the chair, to the staff and to my fellow committee members. I am very proud of our report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's population `carrying capacity'</EMPHASIS>: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">one nation&mdash;two ecologies</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to be part of this debate to take note of our report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's population `carrying capacity'</EMPHASIS>: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">one nation&mdash;two ecologies</EMPHASIS>. As did other members of the committee, I acknowledge the driving force not only behind this report but also behind the House of Representatives Standing Committee for Long Term Strategies, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones). It was his intense interest in this area that encouraged the rest of the committee to decide on this inquiry and it has been a most interesting inquiry. As other speakers have said, we are often, as politicians, related to the day and the moment, but it is very important that we spend more time on the longer-term issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that two different reports in Tuesday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, written in response to the tabling of our report, indicate the range of the debate. Richard Blandy's article in the `Opinion' section is headed `Why an ageing Australia needs to support bigger families'. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A large population problem is looming for Australia in the next century. Unless Australian women have more babies or the number of immigrants arriving in Australia each year becomes larger our population will start to shrink.</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Blandy is no amateur: he is Professor Richard Blandy of the Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research at the University of Melbourne. He goes on to discuss options, and one he is looking at is more effective economic measures to encourage women to have more children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other article is by Tom Dusevic. Titled `The number's up', it looks at an alternative viewpoint in terms of whether we really have a population crisis. Varying opinions were put to the committee during the course of its inquiry. I refer also to Geoffrey McNicoll from the ANU Research School of Social Sciences and a paper he presented to the Australian Population Association in Canberra in September this year. That paper is also quoted in our report. As he indicates, `demography has been a major issue in Australia's development since European settlement'. Initially, we had the sorts of fertility rates that one sees with frontier societies. However, this began to change in the latter part of the 19th century, and in fact so concerned was Australia that it set up a royal commission in 1903. This commission deplored the evident resort to contraception and held the underlying cause to be&mdash;and he quotes the actual report of the 1904 royal commission:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . "selfishness"&mdash;people placing their personal well-being ahead of the task of peopling the continent.</PARA>
<PARA>However, despite the concerns of the royal commission fertility continued to decline, reaching replacement level in the 1930s. As McNicoll notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The transition to low fertility has coincided with industrialization, urbanization and the emergence of the consumer economy, with expansion of education and paid employment for women, and with large changes in marriage and family arrangements and in people's expectations about them. In various combinations these produce irresistible downward pressure on births. The Royal Commissioners if alive today would be dismayed at the scale of selfishness revealed.</PARA>
<PARA>The issue here is that all attempts by governments to encourage women to have more babies to increase the population of the country are likely to fail. In fact, with the advent of contraception, women have voted with their feet and have found that in spite of the delights of procreation and child raising there are numerous delights in the wider world that will ultimately discourage all attempts to have women produce seven children, as was the case earlier in our history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> by Dusevic is very interesting because it quotes one of the issues that we considered in our report, one that was referred to us by Katharine Betts from the Swinburne Institute of Technology when she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finding an optimum population involves value judgments. Different population sizes maximise different goals. For example, a smaller number would commit Australians to continue to aspire to a detached house and a garden. Larger numbers might permit each State to have a world-class opera company. This is a question of people's values and preferences, and that really means that it is a political question.</PARA>
<PARA>Over and above that and in opposition to that view, several submissions concerned the environmental issues that we must face. Quoting further from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> article, the CSIRO argued that as things stand:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia lacks the necessary knowledge and understanding to manage effectively its current population at current living standards. Every extra person, and every unit increase in consumption, increases the need to rectify this situation.</PARA>
<PARA>However, I just want to quote again from a CSIRO submission to our committee, on page 95, from Dr Howard Dengate. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The human impact on the environment is a function not only of population, but also of lifestyle, organisation and technology . . . Any rise in population will increase the necessity and urgency to do what already needs to be done to enhance Australia's population `carrying capacity'. Resource and infrastructure issues, especially regarding water and energy use and waste disposal, already require more attention if Australia is to achieve an ecologically sustainable way of life. If these issues are not adequately addressed, Australia can expect further degradation of land and water resources in certain regions of the coastal zone and on inland river systems, compromising its quality of life&mdash;even at current population levels.</PARA>
<PARA>Many of the people who attended our public inquiries and submitted to the committee put an argument that, given the ecological consequences of population pressure on our continent, we should limit our population. But I believe it is vitally important that we look at population in terms of the policy mix, particularly in terms of how we manage the impact of our current population and increases in our population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, it is very clear that we have to balance those issues and, rather than go back to a golden past where very few people impacted on the environment, we have to look realistically at the current impact and future impacts in terms of our resource use. This is one of the issues that Australia has simply got to stop walking away from as being too hard. It is an area that local, state and federal governments must address in an integrated way if we are going to be able to sustain our current population and, indeed, cope with an increase in population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think one of the earlier concerns, the populate or perish myth, which was presented to us again in different forms, relates to our role in Asia. It is becoming clearer that we will not need a massive increase in population simply to sustain ourselves, because government policy is about moving as an integrated partner into the Asia-Pacific region. We will be able to sustain our current standard of living and, indeed, increase our standard of living, if we are effective as an exporter of manufactured goods and services to the Asia-Pacific area. That in itself will have environmental consequences that we will have to be very aware of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer again to McNicoll's article, because he does look at the lack of population policy. Indeed, this was highlighted in submissions to our report on page 119 where we quoted from Australia's official submission to the 1994 Cairo conference on population and development. That submission stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Australia does not have an explicit or formal population policy directly aimed at influencing the level of population . . . the Government decided that a formal population policy (particularly one which would specify population targets) would not be appropriate for Australia, given its low levels of fertility and diversity of community views as to the character and objectives of such a policy.</PARA>
<PARA>It is the view of the committee that this kind of flicking of population policy into a too-hard basket is not going to be a very effective way to handle this very important question in the future. On page 118 the report quotes from the McNicoll paper that I have referred to before:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Public policy making is a kind of moveable feast. Sets of issues become conjoined, seen by government as requiring coordinated attention, while other `neighbouring issues' are conceptually detached, seen as allied elsewhere or left wholly aside . . . Components of what could potentially be an Australian population policy are instead decided on in other policy arenas. They are not plausibly to be shaken loose in some overall reconfiguration of the make-up of public policy.</PARA>
<PARA>Further in his paper, and it certainly supports our recommendations, McNicoll says this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The approaching centenary of federation is seen as the occasion for a systematic assessment of the institutions of the state, the outcome seen as ranging variously between confident celebration of the original vision and radical renovation . . . Absurdly, however, we choose to relegate population to being a byproduct of all our other decisions. Our stance toward this fundamental dimension of our future is a bizarre helplessness.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that certainly supports the view in our recommendations which I want to refer to in the time left. In our principles, 8.1, we said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So far, much of the debate about population and the `carrying capacity' of the Continent has been of poor quality, highly emotive, with extremes of optimism and pessimism, not based on a rigorous consideration of evidence&mdash;for example, about rates of per capita resource use, availability of water, etc.</PARA>
<PARA>The chair of the committee was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 6 December. The newspaper said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was important for governments to understand that population and immigration were not synonymous, it said, arguing that setting a population policy was a "primary goal" and that choosing immigration levels was a secondary consequence.</PARA>
<PARA>I quote further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Immigration intake must be an instrument of population policy, population policy cannot be a long-term unconsidered side effect of ad hoc immigration practice.</PARA>
<PARA>I think what we have said in recommendation No. 1 cannot be quoted too often. The recommendation said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government should determine that population policy and immigration policy are quite distinct, with differing goals, although the long term consequences are inextricably linked. The political and administrative responsibility for population and immigration must be separated.</PARA>
<PARA>I think our report is a very important contribution to the debate. I hope that McNicholl is wrong when he suggests that it may have no more effect than previous reports in this country. I think it is a very important issue. The government must put consideration into it. It must be coordinated and I believe that we should not allow it to be highjacked by extremists, particularly some of those presenters to our committee who very much took a racist and an ethnocentric view of this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We Australians who have enjoyed the delights of living in a sparsely populated country really have to be accountable now for the way we have used and abused this precious environmental resource as we head towards the centenary of Federation. This is a very important issue and I hope the government will take our recommendations seriously. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The latest report of the Standing Committee for Long Term Strategies, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's population `carrying capacity': one nation&mdash;two ecologies</EMPHASIS>, shows the findings of the committee in relation to the terms of reference for an inquiry into Australia's population carrying capacity. The committee was to consider what sort of population level Australia could support in 50 years and whether we should actually be setting a population target. Tied with the question of population was the question of how population change affects the environmental, economic and social development of our nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the committee's decision to put population growth and immigration in different categories was a good one. Although they are linked, there are very different policy requirements for the management of long-term population change and immigration policy. From the submissions I gleaned a lot of information. There really were quite diverse views, going from a decrease of the population to a level before European settlement to anything in excess of 100 million. There were some quite subjective arguments to go along with both extremes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the committee's view was to equate population carrying capacity with a best, or optimum, population rather than a maximum population. The sorts of concepts for looking at carrying capacity brought out things like the availability of food, water and waste disposal, or an ability to recycle. It is these sorts of things that give us the quality of life. At a cities conference held recently in Melbourne, the theme that seemed to intrigue our overseas neighbours, and even the participants from Europe, was Australia's strong desire to keep a quality of life higher than most&mdash;even, it seemed, at some cost, such as full employment or equity issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quality of life also came out in the many arguments that were put forward by people submitting their thoughts to the committee. Quality of life is great, but sometimes the arguments that are used, such as `What is quality of life?' and `Whose life is of quality?', can be a little one-sided. Many of the people herded into our cities from the country areas because of rural job decline and changes in technology may feel that their quality of life has been eroded. Many who have lost their jobs through changing work patterns and industry restructuring may feel their quality of life has been taken away. Perhaps an increase of population in certain areas might assist those who feel that their quality of life has been challenged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, Australia has no population policy which sets out broad goals for the long term. We have the immigration targets which reflect economic factors, such as unemployment or economic growth rates, and which have long-term population implications. But we need a policy to look at where we are going and/or where we want to go, rather than a lot of improvising. The committee has come up with a concept in which, physically, Australia may be conceived of as two highly habitable segments or islands, separated by an enormous sea of arid and semi-arid landscapes, of mainly salty and sandy soils, which occupy some 70 per cent of the continent&mdash;or 7.7 million square kilometres. The two islands were defined as the south-west corner of Western Australia and the Cairns to Adelaide seaboard, and Tasmania was seen as a third island. The carrying capacity of the arid bits is obviously not going to make that area one which supports many people. So around 10 per cent of Australia is where 95 per cent of Australians live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has therefore given the report the subtitle `one nation&mdash;two ecologies' and I believe this gives a good visual idea as to where our decision making needs to be directed. There is also a new formula, devised by the CSIRO, which is a valuable conceptual tool. It looks at the importance of the organisation of space and of technology, as well as population and lifestyle, as determining factors in the quality and form of human settlement. The example used is the Netherlands. It has a far higher density than Haiti, but its quality of life is superior because of better organisation of resource use, including waste management. This formula could be used for a number of extensions to its original development when we are, say, looking at regional development or city planning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tasmania has always been a bit of Australia that gets forgotten about. It is left off the map occasionally and is seen as rather irrelevant in planning, in overall Australian terms. I am not saying that with any malice; it is just the way life is. I believe it is because we have such a low population base and we have no strength in numbers. Because we are an island, in all the senses of the word, we have the potential for being a model or a pilot for any work that needs testing before being let loose on the rest of Australia. This has recently been recognised and a number of programs are looking at information exchange and some health issues. But I could see this as being useful as a pilot for an increase in population. We can certainly sustain a lot more, but we will have to become smarter and more efficient in our use of resources, particularly water and energy, and also our primary resources, such as wood and minerals. However, to be smarter, we need more skills and more people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the committee's concern about the rise of irrationalism in politics, especially within the green movement. Some members of the green movement seem to be linking the concern for preserving the environment with a strongly racist and anti-immigration movement which has also arisen in Europe. This trend to make migrants the scapegoats raises a false division. For example, the argument is that we can have wilderness, unspoiled rivers and unpolluted beaches or we can have migrants, but we cannot have both. It is a stupid argument and it should be rejected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They say that about employment as well. That argument is simplistic. It also diverts attention from proper resource management through improved waste disposal, energy efficiency and controlling water costs. There are even arguments about population growth leading to a loss of biodiversity and deforestation. We should be very wary of some of these arguments as they are not based on sustainable facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are no definable limits. The committee believes that population should be seen as over immigration, with the greater emphasis on long-term consequences. We need an ongoing debate based on high quality information and independent research. We must look at what is feasible and what is desirable. We must also allay exaggerated fears of what overpopulation might do&mdash;but not let it dictate the agenda. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much for your wise advice. During the presentation of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure report on communications and transport infrastructure requirements of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, progress report on monitoring of issues in the report of the inquiry into ship safety and report on the review of the Auditor-General's audit report on the national highway reports in the main chamber of the House of Representatives there was clearly inadequate time to speak to the reports, and I want to make that point very strongly here. The 45 minutes that was allowed for the tabling of all of the reports and statements last Monday was utterly inadequate. It did not do justice to any of the subcommittees that were involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was ample time later in the day for other reports to be discussed and tabled. If one had been watching the House during the afternoon one would have noticed that some members had difficulty in fleshing out the time that was available for those. I believe committee reports are extremely important. I value very much the work of our standing committees in the parliament and the work that colleagues on both sides of the House put into those inquiries and reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure I tabled three reports last Monday. The first was entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Inquiry into the Sydney 2000 Olympics&mdash;the adequacy of existing and planned aviation services and infrastructure</EMPHASIS>. The second was entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review inquiry into ship standards and safety. </EMPHASIS>The third was <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Efficiency audit review: The national highway `Lifeline of the nation'</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time did not permit me to speak to this last report and I would like to begin with a reference to that now. The Australian National Audit Office's review of the management of the national highway system was referred to the committee in December 1993. The review was carried out during times of change as the heads of government meeting in 1991 changed the road funding and management responsibilities of the Commonwealth and state governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As of 1 January 1994, the Commonwealth government assumed sole responsibility for the funding and management of the national highway, although the states will retain ownership of the roads. The Commonwealth will no longer fund any other types of roads. Most of the report's 33 recommendations have been accepted by the Department of Transport and in its response to the audit report the Department of Transport identified only five areas of disagreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the nature of the audit office's report, we decided as a committee that we would conduct a joint hearing at which both the Department of Transport and the Australian National Audit Office would participate. As a result of that meeting we found that the five areas of disagreement that had been identified by the Department of Transport were no longer a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say from the committee's point of view that we found it a very useful exercise to have both the Department of Transport and the Australian National Audit Office present at the one time. To be able to address questions to either party or to both, even the same question to both, was very useful. We found that a very healthy inquiry procedure. It enabled matters to be resolved immediately where there was a contentious point. If the Department of Transport took a particular point of view and that had not been accepted earlier by the audit office, we would then turn immediately to the Australian National Audit Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams) is here with me and I think he would share the view that it was a very effective process. We had not done it before as a committee and we recommend that procedure to other inquiries. It makes a better use of time. It also makes the inquiry procedure much more effective, that we can test one view against the other there and then and not have to come back some time later. The committee believes that the changes made to the management of the national highway system are beneficial, particularly the introduction of performance agreements and performance indicators which will allow for improved, long-term planning of the national highway system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank the committee members for their assistance in completing the reports. We are particularly fortunate with this committee that we have members, from both sides of the House, who put a lot of effort into inquiries and investigations. We have a very supportive deputy chairman on the committee and to me, as a believer in the committee system, that is critical to the performance of the work of the committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are so many things that we as a parliament can do through the committee system if the committee system is used effectively. But it has to be built upon a basis of cooperation between both sides of the House and participation by members of the committee. I think we are very fortunate in our committee in having that kind of basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, on behalf of the committee I want to thank the staff of the secretariat&mdash;Malcolm Aldons, Les Dunn and June Murphy&mdash;for their efforts and for responding to the call of duty at all sorts of unseemly hours when the pressure was on to get reports out and to get the work done. I would like also to offer special thanks to Denis James from the Parliamentary Library for his assistance on the Sydney 2000 Olympics report.I commend that report and the two other reports to the Committee today, as I sought to do in the House last Monday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the report that we tabled in respect of ship standards and safety. I want to emphasise to the Committee that this report is not a second <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report in terms of its depth, coverage and impact. It is a progress report. When we tabled the original <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report in December 1992, it had an impact right across the world. As a committee, we are very proud of that. As Australians, we are very proud of that. It has become a major handbook in many shipping companies right across the world and has had widespread support from all the maritime nations across the world. It has played an influential part in helping improve the standard of ship safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we tabled on Monday was simply a review of what has happened to the recommendations of that report since December 1992 and what has been the response of our own government. I recommend that members of House peruse the latest report. We go through each recommendation of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS>, setting out the response of our own government, and we briefly report on what is happening in other areas relevant to that inquiry. We must remember that in Australian ports we see only the best of the world's bulk iron ore and coal tankers. In terms of quality, the top 20 per cent of the world's ships utilise Australian ports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Representatives of major exporters and loading facilities stated in evidence to the inquiry that they preferred to see quality shipping in the trades. That is a point that was raised very early in our original inquiry. If Australia was to be seen to be going it alone, in carrying out its responsibilities under the international maritime conventions which it has ratified, that would impact upon freight rates out of Australia and upon the cost of Australian exports and imports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had no evidence before us that this was the case. None at all. I intend to quote the evidence of some of the witnesses who came before us. It puts paid to the claim that if we insist on quality in shipping ships will not come to Australia. The evidence that I will read, from the transcript of the hearings of 27 May 1994, makes it very clear that, as far as the major shippers and ship operators in this country are concerned, what the market wants is quality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 27 May we had before us Mr George Benz, who is the General Manager of Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd. Mr Benz is responsible for the arrangement of shipping. In the case of Hamersley Iron, about 20 per cent of Hamersley iron ore sales are on a cost insurance freight basis, which means that the seller, Hamersley Iron, is responsible for arranging the shipping. It sells the product into the port of destination. The price includes the product, the cost of freight and the insurance. By that means, Hamersley Iron has complete control and responsibility for the product and costs until the product is unloaded at its port of destination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hamersley charters ships for that purpose. One remembers the loss of four bulk iron ore carriers that were loaded at Hamersley Iron's Dampier facility in 1990-91; those were ships that Hamersley had selected and their cargoes were all CIF sales of iron ore. Hamersley now has its own vetting system for the selection of ships and it took a very strong view in what it put to us in regard to making sure that the vessels do meet standards. Mr Benz told us:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do feel that the charterer does have obligations to ensure the ship he uses is of good standard. I also feel that the charterers as a group do exercise that obligation. As you have pointed out in your initial report, Mr Chairman&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that reference is to my role at the inquiry&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">it is a minority of participants who are the bad apples, who are the people who are most responsible for marine casualties. </PARA>
<PARA>We were putting to witnesses in Sydney, on 27 May 1994, the notion that charterers should bear responsibility. After all, it does not matter if the ship is substandard. It does not matter if a ship is unseaworthy. It is tied up at a buoy; it might leak a bit of oil, but it is not going to be much harm to anybody or anything. It is not until a charterer or a cargo owner comes along and says, `Yes I will use your vessel because you have got the cheapest rate, or I can get a benefit from it' that the harm arises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we put that view and questioned witnesses consistently: `Doesn't the charterer have a responsibility?' I hold the very strong personal view that the charterer does have a responsibility to ensure that the vessel is safe and seaworthy and meets the standards. We asked, `Does not the cargo owner have a responsibility?' and that gets a bit greyer, but I still hold that very strong view, because it is a cargo owner who is the beneficiary of cheap rates. It is the cargo owner who turns the key that sets that vessel in motion&mdash;with all of its dangers and risks to its crew and to the environment in which it operates. I said to Mr Benz:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if that ship has been hired on a repeated basis from time to time and the charterer or the hirer could have been reasonably expected to be aware of the condition of that vehicle&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>or that vessel&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a similar kind of thing applies, does it not? It is public accountability, not legal responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Benz's response was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What I am driving at is, if a procurer of a service procures a service, knowing that it will lead to a casualty or constitute a danger, this is a conspiracy.</PARA>
<PARA>It is not Peter Morris saying that. It is not some rabid unionist saying that. The gentleman saying that is responsible for the arranging of the ships for the carriage of the product of one of the largest iron ore shipping companies in this nation. That was Mr Benz, on page 130 of the committee transcript. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then talked more with Mr Benz as we went further along in his evidence. We were testing during the course of those hearings whether exporters and importers are prepared to pay for quality, or whether they want to avoid quality just to get the lowest possible rate. We had the same kind of evidence as came forward in support of quality in shipping from Mr Benz, on behalf of Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd; from Mr Clarebrough, on behalf of BHP Transport; and from Mr Anton Ugland, who was the immediate past president of Intertanko, the largest world association of independent tanker owners. We had a similar set of responses&mdash;all supporting quality in shipping&mdash;from Intercargo, the largest organisation in the world of bulk carrier owners and operators. Mr Benz told us, in reference to quality of shipping, at page 143 of the transcript:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As far as the shipping industry or any other industry is concerned, I think there is a growing realisation that quality pays. It is certainly gaining currency in Australia. It has already proved its worth in Japan, in particular. I think there is also evidence of a drift of so-called substandard ships away from the Pacific Basin, so that the users of ships in this part of the world now demand quality. The major charterers, the major parties dependent on sea transportation, now demand quality. A lot of ships which do not find employment here in the Pacific have been drifting into the Atlantic. We understand that ships which do not find employment here are waiting for weeks to get cargo in the Atlantic until a charterer says, `Okay, I will go for that because I have not got anything else.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People are demanding quality. They are demanding quality from the shipowner, from the manager, from the classification societies, from the insurance companies, all around the business, and if there is high price for quality I think people have come to realise that that price is well worth paying and people do pay a high price for quality because it pays dividends. I think people in the industry are realising that.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was total agreement among the steel mills of the major Japanese shipping companies that they will focus on quality. That means that they will not accept ships which are substandard&mdash;whatever that word means&mdash;and that they will ensure that they do comply with international regulations.</PARA>
<PARA>I am using this information given to the committee because those witnesses are the actual users of the ships. It is their cargoes that are going on the ships. These are not the words of some rabid unionist. This is not some politician trying to score a point. These are the decision makers in the commercial world who are speaking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the Committee's attention to a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Commercial News</EMPHASIS> of 21 November 1994. Mr Benz referred to the drift of substandard ships into the Atlantic; but some months ago in South America, off one of the ports of Brazil, a substandard iron ore ship that did not meet the international standards was loaded with iron ore. It set sail and trouble developed. The Brazilian port authorities would not allow that vessel back in, because it was so bad that they were fearful that it would sink in their port, thus becoming an obstruction to shipping and fouling the environment. So that vessel was taken out to sea in the South Atlantic and scuttled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here is a second one. This is a report of 21 November 1994. The vessel <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trade Daring</EMPHASIS>, a 134,999 deadweight ton Cyprus flag vessel, broke its back and sank alongside the principal iron ore berth on 11 November, effectively closing the installation until it could be removed. I will not go into all the detail of the report, but that underlines the point that Mr Benz was making, that there is a gravitation of substandard shipping away from the Pacific over into the Atlantic, and it is probably a good thing because it concentrates those substandard vessels in the one area. They will have more and more difficulty, even if they have been cheap vessels, in getting cargoes, and commercial discipline will apply. And that commercial discipline will be that vessels have to earn their keep. People cannot sit around for six weeks or 10 weeks trying to get a cargo, even if they have got a cheap ship. So commercial discipline will apply and we will see, I hope, a faster departure from the seas of those substandard vessels, with the risks to human life, to crews, that they constitute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the other areas of ship safety, we have found that there is continuing abuse of crews, a continuing deprivation and exploitation. I have no doubt in my mind that Filipino employers continue to black-list Filipino seafarers who complain, so the seafarers cannot really speak up. Just to go to Intertanko, I said to Mr Ugland at a hearing on 27 September:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your association stresses the use of quality tankers, quality crews?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr Ugland</EMPHASIS>&mdash;It supports it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Chair</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Your association stresses, or prefers the use of, quality vessels, quality ships?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr Ugland</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Yes . . . I think all ships need quality crew, and I think it pays. It is not a question of nationality, it is a question of training and motivation.</PARA>
<PARA>So there, from Intertanko, the largest tanker organisation in the world, is support for the course that Australia is following. We have been greatly heartened as a committee at the work that we have done. When the original report came down it was horrendous to be adopting the course of investigation we were taking, it was absolutely out of court. How could we have the temerity to be asking about the commercial environment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter that I conclude on is the publication of information of ships detained and their deficiencies. That has now been stepped up and widened by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, at the suggestion of our committee. It will do more than anything in the short term to get rid of these vessels, to sweep these vessels from the sea. The actual beneficiaries&mdash;the cargo owners, the charterers, shipowners, the classification societies and the ship managers&mdash;will all have their names published monthly in respect of ships that are detained in Australian ports. When we recommended that originally, it was heresy. Now it is published more extensively by the US Coast Guard and by the United Kingdom, and Lord Donaldson in his report at the beginning of this year came down very strongly in support of the initiative that we had outlined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see getting this information published as a very welcome development. In aviation, if something is wrong with an aircraft, the manufacturer immediately advises all the users of that aircraft. It is public information; it is out there for people using that industry and operating in that industry to be able to respond to and correct that deficiency. But in shipping there has been a veil of secrecy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that all members of the committee are very pleased with the progress being made. We will resume the examination of ship safety standards towards the middle of next year. We will have a much more comprehensive report and that report will be the final report to this the 37th Parliament of Australia. We will be able then, looking at what has happened at the International Maritime Organisation, to make some more pertinent and conclusive recommendations in reporting to the parliament. I commend the reports to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I pay tribute to the role of the chairman of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), in proposing the introduction of the report of the former committee, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS>, and the follow-up report which is being tabled in the parliament today. I am delighted to support his remarks. As deputy chairman of the committee, and on behalf of the other committee members, I want to put on the public record my admiration for the enthusiastic approach of the chairman in his attempts to ascertain the facts and to find the truth. He ensured that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report&mdash;a very good report&mdash;was followed up by this second report, which is a progress report on monitoring of issues in the report of the inquiry into ship safety, and includes the implementation of the earlier recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is remarkable that a committee of the House of Representatives has had such an impact internationally. Again, I put on the public record that people of significance have looked at the recommendations of this committee and they have followed them through at international level. I will follow that point through shortly, but obviously concerns about old shipping&mdash;the number of sinkings and the number of accidents&mdash;are matters that the committee looked at during its recent investigations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth looking at some of the attributes of world shipping. It would cost some $400 billion to replace the vessels that are currently trading around the world. Another interesting feature is that half of the world fleet is on open register, which means that there is less surveillance of the quality and safety standards surrounding those vessels. Also, of course, there is often a more beneficial tax regime. In the tanker trade, 75 per cent of the fleet consists of vessels over the age of 15 years; another very significant fact about which this committee became aware. Australia is the fifth largest exporting nation using sea lanes and sea vessels, and this fact gives a perspective on the importance of international trade and on the use of these vessels in exporting and importing our goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the chairman in commending the committee's approach in the open forum which was conducted in Sydney on 27 May 1994. All the major players in the maritime industry were present at the forum. The forum was very well conducted by the chairman, and the main players were subject to peer group pressure on the comments they have made on the public record. Following on that particular process, members of the committee were able to ascertain the veracity of some of the statements which were made in front of very learned people: classification society observers; shippers; and representatives from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. Representatives from these organisations listened to what was said, and they made some pertinent contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very interested in the ability of the committee to command international personnel to appear before it as witnesses. BHP ran an international conference called Shipshape in Sydney in September 1994. Prior to that conference, the committee was able to ask a number of world-class players in international shipping to appear before it, so that they could make a contribution about their attitudes to ship safety and the ships of shame. They were: Mr John Horrocks and Mr Ewan Kelly, representing the International Chamber of Shipping; Mr Tony Nunn, representing the Institute of London Underwriters; and Mr Andreas Ugland, representing the Intertanko Company. Mr Ugland is a former chairman of the group to which the chairman referred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its appearance before the committee the group raised a number of issues. One of the issues which was raised was the cost of crews; this is one of the most variable costs in running any fleet of tankers or other vessels. Occasionally, international operators cut back on the costs of the crews and the way in which they train and look after them. Another issue which was raised was the training of international crews. The committee received a number of observations from the international personnel and took the opportunity to ask questions on a number of the issues raised: what are the standards; what are the certificates which are issued; and what is the validation of the international training certificates. Obviously, anyone who has an understanding of this issue is concerned, from time to time, that some of the certificates are questionable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The age and registration of ships is another matter on which the committee heard first-rate evidence; for example, the age of a number of ships now in trade, and what action was being taken about those ships. Insurance and risk was another topic, and Mr Tony Nunn, representing the Institute of London Underwriters, gave a truly international perspective to that topic. Some of the evidence which he tabled at the meeting indicated that the older the ship, the greater the likelihood of accident or collision. There was a suggestion put forward that, rather than there being a subsidy for building ships, there should be a subsidy for scrapping older ships. That is an innovative approach. Significantly, because of increasing environmental standards, the double hull approach for big oil tankers was another issue that was raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The credibility of classification societies throughout the world has been under considerable debate by the committee and by witnesses, and these international persons raised that issue, of whether the classification societies&mdash;the 11 major ones and other lesser ones&mdash;did retain international credibility. I might say, in passing, that informal comment by those witnesses suggested that they found members on this committee had an understanding of the issues and asked the right questions, compared with their experience when they appeared before the United States congressional and senatorial committees where politics was the main issue, rather than trying to seek out the truth and to seek out what was happening at the international level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two recommendations sum up our progress to date. I note, for the record, recommendation 3B:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That appropriate operating criteria for classification societies be devised and that only certificates from classification societies, included when a classification society acts as an agent for a flag state, which comply with those criteria be recognised as valid internationally.</PARA>
<PARA>What we are really saying there is that the classification societies should be putting forward valid material in relation to vessels and to the way in which they interpret whether a vessel is seaworthy or less seaworthy, or whether it has some defects. The International Association of Classification Societies has introduced a number of schemes which will improve the performance of these classification societies. Over the time that I have been with the committee, it has had numerous discussions about the ability of classification societies to properly ascertain the seaworthiness, or lack of, of various vessels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other recommendation that I put on the record is recommendation 4A:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Australian Maritime Safety Authority have access to sufficient funds to increase the rate and effectiveness of Port State Control inspections to a level where it ceases to be viable for substandard shipping to call at Australian ports.</PARA>
<PARA>Put in very simple terms, we are saying that the maritime authority should have enough money to make sure that any substandard ships that come to Australian ports are inspected and are held to account. We are putting on the public record that we do not like those sorts of ships coming here and, if they are not up to standard, the Australian authorities will take the necessary action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to refer briefly, in my capacity as deputy chairman, to the other report that is tabled&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The national highway `Lifeline of the nation'</EMPHASIS> and the comments of the National Audit Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a good relationship between the federal funding authorities and the state authorities who implement the funding and also the construction work using these road funding moneys. The audit committee looked at the highway priorities around Australia; the accountability of the state instrumentalities; the way in which the money moved from the federal coffers to the state treasuries; and the quality and progress of the various road constructions. I particularly note that there was an incentive for savings in the budgeted allocations, which state authorities would gain from, and that matter is under consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general, that report indicates a movement in the right direction in terms of audit process and spending money efficiently by the federal authorities via the state construction groups. I commend both reports and I hope that, in the next few months, we will have a further report in relation to ship safety that will conclude a remarkable report of international standing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to comment on two reports by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. One is the progress report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review inquiry into ship standards and safety</EMPHASIS> and the other is <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Efficiency audit review: The national highway `Lifeline of the Nation'</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report on the national highway deals with areas of contention between the Department of Transport and the Australian National Audit Office, which arose following an efficiency audit of management of the national highway scheme, and gets to grips with whether it was being done efficiently or effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were a number of areas which proved to be inefficient and there seemed to have been little concern by road builders to try to use new methods to reduce overall costs. There appeared to be lack of accountability to anyone about what was spent and how it was spent. Few works programs had been drawn up and little prioritisation had been done, so that roads were inclined to just happen in many places. There was certainly a need to get some auditing into that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the planning has been pretty poor in the past and there is a need to do much more in the area of road safety. State governments tend to try to cut corners by leaving out safety precautions, whether they are simple pavement signs, vertical signs and markings, or some of the lines-of-sight designs, and they are very inadequate. I can quote the tragic circumstances which occurred on the Illawarra Highway, a new road in my own electorate, when two people died after a tourist car ran into a local family coming back from Launceston. I can only blame the appalling signage on the road. Much of it was temporary and some of it just was not there at all. Roads should not be open to the public until they are completely ready, because it takes some time for local people to become used to new systems and new schemes. This is very important in regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Educating local communities for change should take place. When a road network which has been in place for somebody's lifetime suddenly changes to a national highway, matters of speed, entry and exits on these roads can become very dangerous. Maybe warnings should be issued for the older generation as to what changes are likely to occur with the upgrading of roads. Although it is clear that there has been considerable improvement in the standard of national highways in recent years, there is still room for improvement, particularly translated to a state level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has been looking at performance indicators and improved information collection as one means of measuring improvements and excellent concepts. But there are some aspects that need to be considered in terms of cutting down the number of road deaths and injuries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There should be a national road signs code that is binding on all states, so that people driving in any one state in Australia will become familiar with them. There are guidelines now, but everyone seems to have a different way of interpreting them. It is about time there is a national code that is part of the national highway scheme structure and that  gives sign distances from intersections, has the same dotted white lines, and the same merging patterns and instructions on all roundabouts. Some of the Tasmanian markings are the most bizarre I have ever seen. We are very good at putting traffic lights on roundabouts and other such nonsenses. There are recommendations in the report to improve the accountability of state authorities through performance agreements and I believe that road design, markings and signs should be a part of that assessment. The review has been very useful and I commend the report to all members of the house. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like the deputy chairman of this committee, the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur), the other report I wish to comment on is the progress report of the ship safety review inquiry. This report goes on from the previous report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS>, which is an international standard report used in other parts of the world to come to grips with this incredible phenomenon of the standard of safe ships in the world. To a great extent this has been driven by the chairman of our committee, the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), who deserves a great deal of credit for the work that has gone into this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This progress report continues the work of documentation that went into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS>, which highlighted the issues associated with improving shipping standards and safety. We were requested to continue working with the government to pursue a safer and more responsible international shipping industry by inquiring on an ongoing basis into developments at a national and international level in relation to issues identified in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been looking at the implementation of the earlier report's recommendations and advancing some new solutions to ship safety issues. Some of those issues have been incredible. The continued abuse and maltreatment of crews on some ships have been terrible. In an incident which was widely reported, a ship ran aground and the crew had to abandon ship. The ship had Greek officers and had people of two or three other nationalities as crew. In that emergency none of them could really communicate with the others because of their different languages. This came up in evidence that we received through our committee. Such language barriers in those circumstances lead to confusion and panic, and could mean unnecessary loss of life, environmental damage from oil spills and other problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were told in our hearings that some of the officers of ships that have come into Australian ports have been incapable of submitting loading plans to harbourmasters. It is incredible that people have qualifications to take ships around the world, but when they come into Australian ports they cannot submit a loading plan to the harbourmaster. That goes right to the heart of some of the issues on safe shipping. Loading a ship wrongly can put enormous stress on the structure of that ship, which means that it could fail when put under a lot of pressure in heavy seas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence given has shown that it is very hard to do anything about foreign ships registered in certain countries. That was constantly coming up. We talk of ships being registered in some countries because of the commercial advantages of what are called `flags of convenience'. Those countries should have their flags known internationally as `flags of shame'. If those countries want to put flags on ships which are substandard and put people's lives at risk, then their flags should become known as flags of shame, and we should constantly remind those countries that their flags are being seen as being flags of shame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the International Maritime Organisation really does not have any teeth in the sense of being able to stop a ship from sailing, there has been a great problem in getting ships and shipping companies to comply with international conventions and their requirements. We need some means of giving the International Maritime Organisation the power to act to suspend or expel flag states from conventions with which they do not comply. One way to assist with this is to ensure transparency of action. We need to ensure that those that transgress are reported publicly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australian ports now we are starting to get those publications, and we are starting to get those names appearing. In the United States of America they are doing the same, and I understand that England is now looking at the same concept of naming these ships and companies that do not comply. Then we will get some names up so that it can be seen who they are. Let us do that in a very big way. All the major players, which include shipowners and managers, classification societies, flag states, charterers and cargo owners, should in some way be responsible for the state of a ship and the safety of its crew. Improved performance on all sides will improve the safety of ships worldwide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Improvements have been made to the technical side of shipping, with bills of lading and the transfer of information. These improvements should lead to a more efficient and cost-effective turnaround of ships. The excuses for hiring substandard ships are no longer valid, because the port authorities are aware of the condition and the availability of ships. Responsible charterers and cargo owners should be well aware of substandard vessels, and they should be able to identify and to avoid using those vessels. If charterers and cargo owners ignore that advice, they should be subject to public exposure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The general argument about using trained workers&mdash;whether it is in manufacturing or whether it is in any other employment&mdash;applies in Australia. Trained people who are competent in carrying out their tasks will increase productivity, and there is no reason why the same principle should not apply in world shipping. If competent people maintain ships, those ships will be more productive and, in the long run, they will return a bigger percentage of income to the owners. Although there is a considerable extra cost to owners to use competent, well-trained crew to maintain vessels, in the long term the owners have safer and more productive ships and, therefore, their profit margin increases. This theory is exactly what applies in the rest of our country, and it is our argument for the training of the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that the people involved with substandard ships have been identified, there is evidence enough that companies should not have to use substandard vessels. If companies ignore the advice that they receive about substandard vessels, they should be subject to public exposure. Public exposure will ultimately ensure that substandard vessels do not exist in international shipping. The problem is far from solved, but those responsible must ensure that the world has a safe shipping fleet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ships come to Australia from all parts of the world, and more countries are becoming involved in shipping. Some of those countries have neither been open to scrutiny nor been accepting of international standards, and their standards will certainly have to improve to meet world shipping standards. If their standards do not improve, authorities should not hesitate to name the country responsible. If ships are substandard, they should fly a flag to be known as the `flag of shame'. That flag should be used to identify and expose substandard ships, and the ships should be named. That action should be taken not only in Australia but around the world. It should be possible to report the shipowners and the shipping companies which do not comply with decent international standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chairman and my fellow committee members have worked hard to put this report together. The report is, of course, part of continuing work and the final report will come down in the new year. I commend the report to this Committee and to all members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the time I have been in this House it has become apparent to me that committees are very often used by the executive government to keep politicians busy so that they simply do not cause any trouble. Committee members can find that they waste a lot of time in committees, putting in a lot of work and effort when sometimes that work seems as if it is not going to amount to much. I believe that the reports we are dealing with here today are both very different.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must commend the work of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. I believe the committee has been very well served by its deputy chairman, the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur), and admirably served by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), who has been without a doubt a driving force on this committee. I think his experience, his sheer bulldog determination, his vast knowledge and his ability to cut through a lot of hyperbole has been of enormous benefit to the committee and, consequently, to the nation. If we were going to adopt any of the ideas of overseas countries, I think we should give consideration to the Chinese idea and make the honourable member for Shortland a national treasure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the interesting things in the progress report on the ship safety review inquiry is that we were told repeatedly at the start of our evidence gathering, which was very widespread, that we in Australia could not act unilaterally, that we must not act alone and that, if we did, it would have an enormous detrimental effect on trade and we would drive shipping away from Australia. This has proved to be, we believe, nonsense. There was no real evidence to support the claim. In fact, it is quite clear that by demanding standards Australia has achieved for this nation a situation where it is the top 20 or 25 per cent of the world's fleets that come here. Obviously, the ships of lesser quality, the `ships of shame', are going elsewhere. It is incumbent upon other nations to do the same as we have done here to drive them into the scrapyards where they belong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at this report, it became obvious to us that it had to be a multi-level approach. We had to have the cooperation of shipowners and managers and they had to accept their responsibilities; classification societies had to accept their responsibilities; flag states had to take some interest in the condition of ships that were flying their flags, and not merely collect the money; and the charterers and cargo owners also had a very large responsibility. I think it is true to say that the original report we brought down in December 1992 was the reason that these issues were raised and I think it is generally accepted that the report got international acclaim. It was reviewed on the BBC in the United Kingdom. I know that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Readers Digest</EMPHASIS> ran articles in, I think, nine languages based on our report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The standard of the submissions that came to us in subsequent reviews has improved dramatically. The report is going to make an impact for the benefit not just of Australia but for the world, and for the safety of seamen. There is no doubt that shipowners have in the past taken a view that cheap rates were their opportunity and that, really, they did not have any great responsibility. Cargo owners now&mdash;in part, due to our report, I think&mdash;recognise that they do have this responsibility. This in itself is going to have a significant effect and impact on the improvement of standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other things we found was that, no matter how good the mechanics of a ship were, if the standard of the crew was substandard or inadequate, then the ship was going to be in trouble and it was going to be a potential danger to itself and to other areas. This is really commonsense and everyone should realise that communication is absolutely vital in a ship. For too long it had not been considered and people had been prepared simply to look the other way. It took the commonsense of this report to bring home to people the need for improved crewing standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe those crew standards are anything like high enough yet. They have a long way to go but I think they are rising. The fact that people are aware of them is in large part due to the heavy emphasis that our report gave to this aspect. I think it is incumbent upon all maritime nations to make sure that their ships carrying their crews do have that level of communication. If it is not there, it will simply put their nationals in danger. It will put in danger the environment and it will also put in danger, of course, other people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect that we have highlighted is this unilateral action which I mentioned earlier. There is no doubt that port state control reporting is very beneficial. Australia is one of the frontrunners in that. The United Kingdom now has port state control reporting. It has been available in the civil aviation area for a long time. This is also going to make a very big impact. Opening up the whole industry to scrutiny can only have a very beneficial impact on the whole industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that does concern me was an element in some of the submissions we received that was saying that insisting on high standards would raise costs and this would cause us to be uncompetitive. I think this is simply arrant nonsense. I think the report is actually showing that. There is no doubt that people have to pay for a higher standard ship but the cost is not greatly above that of low standard ships. To interpret that into a cost at the end of the day is very hard to do. Efficient, high standard shipping has other benefits. There are cost savings in terms of fewer breakdowns. There are cost savings in terms of more reliable delivery, less demurrage, all those sorts of things. Of course, those benefits are passed on to consumers. I think on balance high quality shipping has cost savings; it does not cost the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the potential costs to the community of low standard shipping. It is true that an iron ore bulk carrier that goes down&mdash;as, sadly, too many of them did&mdash;does not have a great environmental impact. Iron ore is not polluting; it is an inert substance. The ships themselves usually do not carry an enormous amount of oil; it will leak out over time probably. Lives are lost. Yes, that is sad but that is somebody else's life and that has no great impact. Let us look at some of the other dangerous cargoes that are carried around the world now; let us look at an accident involving these. I am reminded of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> which lost its bow off the coast of Western Australia. It was only through sheer luck in the tides and the winds that that enormous cargo did not come ashore in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept that the polluting qualities of oil are probably being greatly overstated, as is the wont of the environmental lobby. Oil pollution is, nevertheless, a very messy process and a very costly process. If it was toxic chemicals instead of oil, the consequences could be far more severe. So I believe any nation, as a simple insurance policy, should ensure that any cargoes carried off its shores that are of a toxic nature or could be of long-term detriment to the environment should be carried in ships of very high standard. It would seem to me to go without saying that it is in the national interest to make sure that does occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that I think the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report does not touch on but which needs to be highlighted is that it needs to be said over and over again that Australia is a maritime nation. On a per capita basis, we are one of the countries most involved in shipping in the world. It is beholden upon us in our national interest to have a very viable shipping industry. A nation like Australia should never have its shipping entirely in the hands of foreign interests as we do at the moment. It is simply a matter of insurance that Australia has a viable and large efficient transport service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that we are competitive with all developed countries. We should not be expected to compete with low standard ships, whose undertrained, underpaid Third World crews present enormous dangers. Our report did not directly touch on that, but it is a conclusion that can certainly be drawn from the information we have gathered. A very high standard maritime industry is important for this nation. It goes without saying there will be immediate benefits to the current account if we were to carry more of our products on Australian ships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other report I want to deal with is the report on the national highway, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lifeline of the nation</EMPHASIS>. It was overshadowed by the acclaim and world recognition received by  <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS>. It is, nevertheless, a very workmanlike document that brings together the threads in trying to understand where Australia is heading in national highway construction. I wish to highlight the need for an audit of the national highway and the distribution of priorities. For too long, Australia had a situation where population demand has determined where roads are built. We continually tend to build superhighways and bypass roads around our coastal cities, whilst neglecting the clear demands for roads in less populated areas. Roads built in those areas would enhance the national interest by encouraging the rapid production of export wealth for the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that if a bypass road around Perth, the capital city of my own state, has any benefit at all in terms of efficiency to industry, that benefit is hard to quantify. It certainly would not be taken into calculation in any job tendering or quoting. On the other hand, roads built through areas of mineral potential would open up new mining potential and produce a clear and immediate benefit to the whole nation. We did try to look at that in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that this government has changed the priorities, or the form of assessment. Formerly, we had a situation where the Commonwealth government allocated the money, but the states said where the priorities were and where the roads were to be built. The state authorities were doing it entirely on a traffic count basis. We introduced a requirement for the development of potential roads to be taken into consideration. This has helped in some way&mdash;although not enough, in my view&mdash;to redirect road construction into those areas where it will create the most wealth for the country.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe both reports are good. I have been proud to serve on the committee. I certainly commend the staff of the committee and all those members who participated in it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge the comments that have been made about the chair of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris). He certainly has become a legend in his own day, or a legend in the life of this parliament. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report was produced before I entered the parliament; it was tabled in December 1992, and it has become a report of national and international significance. This was evidenced in the most recent ships safety review and the degree to which our inquiry excited the ongoing interest of industry. It is a tribute to the respect that industry has for the honourable member for Shortland and for the work that he has done in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned, the report is of international significance as well as of national significance. That was typified by the conference that was held by BHP&mdash;the `Shipshape' conference&mdash;on 27 and 28 September this year where we saw the largest gathering of shipping interests ever assembled in Australia. I think that is evidence of international interest in a report produced by this particular parliament. The recommendations of the ship safety review need to be taken very seriously by the government. There is still much to be done in this area. It was obvious from the hearings that I attended in relation to this review that we were settling in for the long haul as far as improving ship's safety was concerned. I pay particular tribute to the honourable member for Shortland and other members of the committee for their enduring interest and work in this very important area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second report I would like to comment on is report of the Sydney Olympics inquiry. Committee members and members of the Committee will note that in its terms of reference the committee was asked to inquire into the communications and transport infrastructure requirements of the Sydney Olympics. That inquiry dealt mainly with the adequacy of existing and planned aviation services and other infrastructure. I am quite fortunate in that I also sit on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. We have been looking at ways in which Australian industry might participate more fully in the Sydney Olympics and at ways to get benefits for the Australian economy from that industry participation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that this report on the requirements for the Sydney Olympics deals mainly with transport infrastructure requirements. The committee did not deal with the communications area. It took the view that communications technology was moving at a rapid pace and that, since there were such significant developments occurring in communications technology, it would be better for the committee to examine these particular issues a bit later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the report mainly focused on aviation infrastructure requirements. The committee had some difficulty in the definition of terms, the assembling of data and in making some sense of the various forecasts that had been made by various agencies. However, we did come to the conclusion that unless the infrastructure problems at Kingsford Smith airport were addressed there would be some real danger that the airport would not be able to cope with the pressure that would come on it at the time of the Sydney Olympics. The honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) obviously has a burning interest in this particular issue and I think he would be of the view that the airport does not have the infrastructure now to cope with the traffic that is going through. I had cause to attend a meeting in Melbourne the other day, and a particular person was late for the meeting because the plane spent about 45 minutes on the tarmac at Kingsford Smith airport before it was able to take off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Shortland noted in his tabling remarks, one particular thrust of the committee has largely been overtaken by the discussion that is now taking place around the construction of Badgerys Creek. If that particular development is to proceed, and no doubt it will, within the time frame that we have set for the Olympics, the problems that we have identified at Kingsford Smith airport may not materialise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me pick up on the recommendation that relates to the ancillary infrastructure that feeds that airport. It is obvious from the evidence that was presented that certainly the road infrastructure needs some critical examination and attention. The problems with getting into Kingsford Smith airport are quite significant and that is one issue that will have to be addressed. The committee has made a recommendation that will address that problem in a bit greater detail in the context of the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really enjoyed working with the committee members on the various reports. I would like to thank the chair for his tolerance in dealing with new members of parliament. Obviously, we are on a steep learning curve in these inquiries. We are asked to get on the front foot and to become involved in the proceedings to make judgments about the evidence that is presented. That can be a daunting task to a new member. It is very comforting to have older members, and members who have been around this parliament for a while, giving us guidance. I thank the honourable member for Shortland for the guidance that he has given me and other first term members. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think it is too extravagant a claim to say that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure has put shipping on the world's agenda. People were aware of shipping; ships are always along our coastline. But some people knew about, and others would not talk about, the condition of many of these ships and the problem of shipping not only around the Australian coastline but also throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the time the committee took evidence, and when its first report was brought down, it received worldwide attention. The report highlighted not only the deplorable conditions of the ships that travel through Australian waters&mdash;rust, decks painted and covered with canvas, no safety equipment or proper standards&mdash;but also the exploitation of the ships' crews&mdash;their abuse, both sexual and physical, and their lack of wages. It was a sorry tale, indeed a disgraceful tale, that led to a new expression `ships of shame.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true to say that, since the tabling of the first report, shipping has received much more publicity. That is because people are taking more and more interest in the condition of ships and, indeed, in the condition of the crews on the ship. When members of the Maritime Union speak of the condition of shipping, they are no longer roundly abused by the farming or the mining interests as used to be the case in the past. I remember talking in the House about the condition of ships in Port Kembla&mdash;I gave the example of a Chinese ship that was detained there&mdash;and being abused by members of the opposition who were mouthpieces for the farmers of Australia. They were prepared to see their cargo go out in deplorable ships that were crewed by people under deplorable conditions. The crew were half-fed and half-starved. As one of the other speakers said, how can ships be decent if they do not have a properly trained, properly maintained and respected crew?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that there be a watching brief on both local and international shipping. This is especially important in Australia because it is an island continent and is more dependent on shipping than most. For a whole host of reasons, the world's shipping fleet is ageing. Replacement ships are not being built. Crews and officers are not being adequately trained and this will have an impact on Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) said it was a long haul. Indeed, it is a long haul and all the nonsense I hear in this parliament about selling off our national line, which carries less than five per cent of our cargo anyway, really frustrates me. What we should be doing in Australia, instead of talking about selling off our national line and selling off our lifeline, is talking about building ships here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People talk to me about the cost of building ships in Australia. For two years running in the summer break, at my own expense, I have been in Denmark. Denmark, which has got a wage structure as high as, if not higher than, Australia, has a very rewarding shipbuilding industry. It uses modern technology, it is professional at it. We could do that. We could build ships here, as we have shown in many other things, but we do not do that. We just say, `Oh, well, it's far too expensive to build ships in Australia.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if there were a massive worldwide shipping construction industry put in place tomorrow, it would still mean that within the next 10 to 15 years there will be a shortage of ships and there will be a shortage of officers and properly trained ratings. With so many competing interests on shore, the ocean, or going down to the sea in ships, no longer holds the appeal or attraction it once did&mdash;indeed, only a few years ago. Given the ageing of the world shipping fleet and the lack of proper training, it is inevitable that supervisory authorities, such as the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, will have to be ever more vigilant. To give credit where it is due, over the past few years AMSA has became much more vigilant and has more properly targeted inspections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was particularly concerned that the government did not accept the recommendations of the committee to deny entry of ships that do not meet ILO 147 standards concerning crew employment conditions. The government considered it was impossible to assess whether a ship complied with ILO 147 until it was already in port. Therefore, ships could not be prevented from trading in Australian waters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was a cop-out for the government. The number of ships that have been here and have been detained because they do not meet ILO 147 is evidence that there are a lot of ships out there, and what the government is saying concerning ILO 147 is hardly a deterrent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a particular problem in Australia with shipping, especially up in the north and the north-west. We have foreign owned, foreign flagged and foreign crewed ships coming here for a very brief period to pick up a cargo and go out. There is some argument about whether we have the power to impose conditions on those ships and whether it would be better if that happened in the flag state. The fact is that the flag states, for reasons best known to themselves, do not impose conditions. If a ship which was in a disgraceful condition went down off the Australian coast and polluted it, it would be the Australian taxpayers who would pick up the tab, despite all the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agreed very much with the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell)&mdash;I do not always agree with the member for Kalgoorlie&mdash;when he was talking about some of the other substances that ships are carrying. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> made spectacular television footage. When we saw the television coverage of it we thought how good it was that the television cameras could get so close from the helicopters. We have all made speeches in this House. I sometimes think that, if the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> incident had not happened, half a dozen of us would not have had anything to speak about for the last two years, we have spoken about it so frequently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an even more insidious cargo going up and down the Australian coastline, that is, some chemicals. If chemicals went into the water, it would not be spectacular television as happened in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> because no one would really see the result, but the impact on the maritime environment, on the seashore, on the Barrier Reef, on the fish would be much worse. That is a very important thing that we have to watch carefully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of people were very sceptical when we started this inquiry. No-one knows that better than the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris). In fact, an editorial appeared in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lloyd's List</EMPHASIS>. Is that not wonderful&mdash;a group of Australian politicians subject to an editorial in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lloyd's List</EMPHASIS>? Basically, it said, `What would this group of colonial politicians know about shipping? It will be a knee-jerk reaction. They will do this. They will do that.' That editorial gave us a serve. During my trip to Scandinavia, everyone I talked to about shipping showed me that editorial. What happened when we brought out our report? We made the editorial of that very same paper, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lloyd's List</EMPHASIS>, but this time it was praising us for the work we had done and the contribution we had made to international shipping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People say, `Yet another committee has been established', but the work we do can make an important contribution. I believe that this progress report has made a significant contribution to shipping, not only in Australia but worldwide. It is respected worldwide. We have brought a new term into usage: ships of shame. Wherever we go they use the term `ships of shame'. In England they talk about their ships of shame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember sitting with the honourable member for Shortland one day and asking, `Peter, what are we going to call this report?' He said, `We are going to call it <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS>.' The committee highlighted that. This report has made an important contribution, but we cannot rest on our laurels. The condition of shipping is far too important. Hopefully, the work of the committee will continue under the able chairmanship of the honourable member for Shortland. I hope that I will be able to remain a member of the committee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to continue the remarks I was making in the House on Monday when we tabled the report of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Justice under scrutiny: report of the inquiry into the implementation by governments of the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody</EMPHASIS>. We may have a little more time today to speak to the report, but I certainly do not want to cut into the time available to my colleague the honourable member for Grey (Mr Wakelin), whom I injudiciously did not allow to speak in the House during the tabling of the report the other day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been quite a lot of response in the media to the tabling of this report. In a press release, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) described the committee's report as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . an invaluable assessment of the progress in dealing with the recommendations of one of this country's most important national enquiries.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . my referral to the committee of Government reports on responses to the Royal Commission's recommendations and the establishment of the position of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner were initiatives going far beyond what the Royal Commission itself recommended in the area of public accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will continue to press for the action that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people rightly demand as a response of the Royal Commission's findings.</PARA>
<PARA>The shadow spokesperson on Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), said the committee `has made a serious and painstaking effort to assess government's response to the recommendations'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, our committee's report is not being met with universal approval, and I hope that other colleagues on the committee will speak about this more in depth. I refer to the reporting of our committee's report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> of 6 December with the headline `Police branded racist'. That provoked a not unexpected response from Queensland. The president of the Queensland Police Union branded our report as absolute garbage, in spite of the fact that he had not seen it. Both the minister and the police commissioner expressed considerable reservations. Commissioner O'Sullivan said, `I wonder how many law-abiding citizens within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community were interviewed'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my understanding that all of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who appeared before the inquiry were law-abiding citizens, and they in no way abused law and order during the hearings&mdash;not only those in Queensland but all over the country. I am reminded of the situation when we held a public hearing in Sydney. A large number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and other community supporters found themselves outside the legislative chambers in Sydney. There was considerable concern expressed that there would be a riot, and at the behest of the Speaker of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly the parliamentary officers were seriously considering closing the parliament. It was my concern as chair of the committee that that would indeed provoke a riot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I was negotiating with the speaker of the New South Wales house, I returned to find that all of the community people had filed in peaceably and were sitting in the public room&mdash;or standing, because they had run out of seats&mdash;in a very peaceable way. They were displaying some signs and so on, but there was at no stage any disorder, such was their commitment to making sure that the inquiry went ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, in spite of members of the Queensland Police Service and the minister not having had an opportunity to look at the full report but relying solely on the clippings and some of the material that we had faxed up to them, I am afraid to say that the police minister found the report `shoddy, superficial and silly'. It is his view that the people who wrote the report are destined to remain on the backbench forever. I am glad that the future careers of all the federal parliamentarians who worked very hard and most diligently on this report are in the hands of their relevant caucus groups in this place. I would hope that, in spite of the reaction from Queensland, on mature reflection and on an opportunity to really go through the report they will see the value of the constructive criticism that we have made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> in its editorial of the 6th said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The federal parliamentary committee report . . . clearly must be taken seriously . . . the police response to the Roma St affray that followed the death of Daniel Yock . . . is a touchy area. The police themselves, having probed the circumstances of that unfortunate breach of the peace at the Transit Centre, must realise they have not emerged covered with glory.</PARA>
<PARA>Although it makes some criticisms of us, the final comment in the editorial is that `the police should be willing to open their door to the inquiry'. In response to certain criticisms that have been levelled at us by Queensland, we based our criticisms on the official report of the Queensland Police Service which is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report of the investigation into the incident on 8 November 1993 involving members of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community and police personnel outside police headquarters</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, it was not about whether `Aboriginal' is put in lower or upper case but serious concerns about the position of cross-cultural policing in Queensland state, of which the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This document has not been sanctioned by our Service at this time.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Observations made by members of the Review Committee during interviews showed Inspector . . . and Senior Sergeant . . . as being mentally and emotionally conditioned to the perceived plight of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander people. Their concerns and leanings appeared to be towards total commitment to the needs of those people.</PARA>
<PARA>Those making the report obviously have a concern and they have made the following recommendation under the heading `Recommendations arising from defects in police procedures':</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.3 Cross-Cultural Support Service members serve a maximum of 2 years in that role to safeguard members against familiarity and excessive personal and emotional interaction and contact.</PARA>
<PARA>So there is real concern about the attitude of senior police officers. We are hoping that our constructive criticisms will be taken in that line as a challenge to improve the changes that have already been made in the Queensland Police Service and not be rejected out of hand as garbage. But I am pleased that we have had at least that reaction because we have not had a great deal of response from other states. At least I have now seen the Western Australian report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of 6 December that we have been reported and I understand that there will be a further report coming down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to take time from other members of the committee, but we had very disturbing accounts of over-policing and abusive practices in Western Australia. We have drawn clear attention to the meal allowance policy, which seems to be a very positive encouragement to arrest people, and we have drawn attention to the over-policing in places such as Wiluna and Roebourne, as we have drawn attention to the more positive community police relations in places like Kalgoorlie. I just want to make a comment on a report from the Aboriginal Legal Service of Western Australia that we took in our evidence about both over-policing and using street offences to clear the streets of Aboriginal people. I quote from chapter 8, 8.70:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of the charges for street offences were for quite trivial matters. The committee heard of an elderly woman in court for urinating in a public park at 2 a.m. The magistrate pointed to the triviality, in that the only people who could see her committing this act in the dark were policemen with torches. She was nonetheless convicted and fined $5.00.</PARA>
<PARA>This is one example of the sort of harassment and unnecessary over-policing that occurs on a regular basis in Western Australia. Indeed, we heard in New South Wales of similar harassment of Aboriginal people, from Sydney through to Wilcannia. These situations must be attended to. I hope there will be a great deal of community discussion, dialogue and debate about this very considerable report that all members of the committee worked extremely hard on. The evidence on which we based our criticisms and our recommendations is included in the report so that it can be totally transparent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the report will be taken with the seriousness which it deserves and responded to not only by the federal government but by all state and territory governments. I thank the hardworking secretariat and members of the committee for their cooperation. I will leave it to my fellow committee members now to address the report with their concerns. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the absence of the deputy chair of the committee, the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), I speak as an opposition member of the committee on the tabling of this report from the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Justice under scrutiny: report of the inquiry into the implementation by governments of the recommendations in the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody</EMPHASIS>. Firstly, I would like to thank my fellow members and particularly thank the committee staff: Allan Kelly, who is in the committee room currently, and the inquiry staff, Craig Dukes, Gabrielle Jess, Penne Humphries and Peter Ratas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody produced a report addressing not only the immediate circumstances of deaths in custody, and that was in December 1988 with an interim report from Justice Muirhead, but also the underlying issues that affect the daily lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people&mdash;health, water supply, housing, education, literacy and subsequent life options. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final report with its 339 recommendations came down late in 1991 and the government response was in March 1992. We are now in December 1994. I hope the government will be able to live up to its response period because we have recommended that responses be made within three months. I understand it is a commitment of this current government that it will respond to this report within the three-month guideline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its inquiry the committee was keen to ensure that the royal commission's report and its recommendations were not allowed to gather dust on a shelf but that they continue to be implemented. With that in mind, I am reminded of the comments of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) about the use of parliamentary committees. Let us trust that this report does not gather dust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a privilege to work on this bipartisan committee. It is worth having a look at some of the detail. The first point I would like to document is the number of areas of government, state and federal, that are involved with the implementation of the recommendations. There is the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, the Australasian Police Ministers Council, the Corrective Service Ministers Conference, and the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy which I really do hope can lift its game because there is much to be done in that area and I have not been impressed personally by what I have seen thus far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs, the Health and Community Services Ministerial Council, the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Resource Management, the Tourism Ministers Council, the Australian Standing Committee on Tourism and the national supply group. That is the spread of government that is involved in the implementation of the royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The monitoring process is important to ensure ongoing implementation and to ensure that the implementation is consistent with the thrust and spirit of the 339 recommendations of the royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee found that in theory there was quite a lot of monitoring taking place but not much change in reality for Aboriginal people. Much of our report is based on the criticism of Aboriginal people themselves. For example, the following agents were charged with the task for monitoring the implementation of the royal commission recommendations. They include ATSIC's Royal Commission Government Response Monitoring Unit, ATSIC regional councils, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet&mdash;and I must say that I felt that they were struggling with this issue&mdash;the Standing Group of Commonwealth Representatives, Social Justice Commissioner Mick Dodson, state based Aboriginal justice advisory committees, and in some states these have not been thus far put into place, state/territory monitoring units, deaths in custody watch committees and the Australian Institute of Criminology's National Deaths in Custody Monitoring and Research Unit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are 20 to 30 separate bodies. As I said, a lot of monitoring is going on. Anyone would think that we would be starting to get it right but perhaps it may also be a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth. In fact, we are not getting it right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee found that a number of important recommendations were not being fully implemented and that other recommendations were not being implemented at all. The royal commission stressed the need for indigenous people to be consulted at every stage of the implementation process. However, we heard of a number of examples where consultations had not occurred and, indeed, where some organisations falsely claimed that they had consulted widely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The royal commission also recommended that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations be involved wherever possible. This has not been done as extensively as it should be and in some cases it has not been done at all. The royal commission sought the establishment in each state and territory of an independent Aboriginal justice advisory committee to provide each government with advice on Aboriginal perceptions of criminal justice matters and implementation of its recommendation. As I have mentioned, that is quite variable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An area of interest to this committee for many years has been the development of procedures that will allow Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations to account to government for their funding properly but least onerously and in a manner as convenient as possible for those organisations to fulfil. We found that indigenous organisations were still being `funded to fail' because they did not have adequate financial or managerial skills or training. In our recommendation 15 we have outlined our response to recommendation 197 of the royal commission, suggesting that that area should be improved very considerably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recommendation 193 the royal commission also pointed out that accountability could be very much improved. However, the federal government, particularly the Department of Finance, has failed to implement this recommendation, despite giving unqualified support to do so. As state and territory governments have said they will look favourably on implementing procedures developed by the federal government, this delay by the federal government is inexcusable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned earlier that the committee listened to submissions which took in wide-ranging issues facing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. In that context I have already mentioned my concern about the national drug strategy. Obviously, there is a link between the abuse of drugs&mdash;whether it be alcohol or other substances&mdash;the role of the police, the crime rate and, of course, the custody rate. It seems to me there has been a total inadequacy in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the health issues we looked at was the hearing condition otitis media, which is generally brought on by cold, flu or chest infection. In fact, we devoted a whole chapter to it, an indication of the degree of importance of this health issue. The infection causes the tube that connects the ear and nose to swell, which stops the normal drainage and ventilation of the middle ear. It reduces the flow of sound to the child, and hearing is reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee learnt that this is a large-scale problem in indigenous communities, with some communities reporting that up to 98 per cent of children were affected. It is estimated that otitis media is 10 times more common in indigenous communities that in non-Aboriginal communities. In that context, it is worth quoting from the report at dot point 12.10:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a submission to the Royal Commission, the then Commonwealth Department of Community Services and Health, National Acoustic Laboratories, estimated that between 25% and 50% of the 7,500 Aboriginal school children in Northern Territory Aboriginal Schools had a hearing loss caused by chronic Otitis Media. Based on evidence presented to the Committee, this would appear to be a conservative estimate, as it was often quoted that the incidence of Otitis Media was between 80% and 98%.</PARA>
<PARA>How many of us can imagine how a child is affected by hearing loss in a learning situation? It can result in not only significant learning disabilities and a loss of confidence in the school system; it can result in leaving school early. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although it was not within the scope of the report to consider, the committee found that governments had not seriously addressed the issue. The committee recommended that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Council of Australian Governments develop an approach to prevent, screen and treat otitis media. We recommended that schools be prepared to deal with the condition in Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander children. We look forward to the government taking on board that recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I point out that the key element is still the degree of commitment of governments and departments, and their willingness and capacity to consult effectively with indigenous organisations. Otherwise, we have to consider the effect on Aboriginal communities and ultimately their own commitment to self-help that this failure to come to terms with those 339 recommendations of the royal commission will have. </PARA>

My congratulations to those members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this is a very important report. I am disappointed with the fact that people who have not yet read the report have already come out in public and attacked its findings. Firstly, that is an immature process and, secondly, it does them no credit as important people in the community when they have been prepared to reject the findings of a very important report before they have even had the chance to read it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I talk about the report itself, I might comment on some of the media presentations. The Queensland Police Union has described the report as `garbage' before it has even had a chance to read it and know what it says. It relied solely on a limited press report which my colleague the member for Capricornia indicated was in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> on Tuesday, 6 December. The union was unaware that several very senior police in fact gave evidence to our committee. It has claimed that we have not spoken to police and yet, if we actually look at the transcripts of evidence that this committee has received, we in fact spoke to senior Queensland police officers in the Queensland parliamentary building. The inquiry was advertised nationally, including in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper, and we received no submission from the Queensland Police Union even though the major bulk of this report was about issues that the Queensland Police Union should have been involved with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commissioner O'Sullivan, the Commissioner of the Queensland Police Service, said he was upset by the report but he also had obviously not even read it. Mr O'Sullivan is reported as saying, `I wonder how many law-abiding citizens within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island community were interviewed?' I can assure Mr O'Sullivan, as my colleagues did, that all of the people whom we interviewed were law-abiding citizens. They were important leaders of the Aboriginal communities in Cairns and in Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his comments, Mr O'Sullivan is attempting to slur Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander witnesses to the inquiry. It is a very grubby action by him. It is something that I reject and I find totally inappropriate for a commissioner of police. In fact, what it does is reinforce the very message we were making in this report, that senior officers of the Queensland police do seem to have a problem dealing with their own attitudes towards Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The police minister, Paul Braddy, has claimed that the committee heard only from complainants without hearing the police side. Again, I absolutely reject that criticism. When our subcommittee visited Cairns, its members had the opportunity to speak to police officers in Cairns. In fact, when the subcommittee came to Brisbane to have hearings with the Queensland government, there were two senior police officers as part of the Queensland government delegation that came to give evidence and answer questions from our subcommittee. </PARA>

It is a pity that the police commissioner and the police minister have not in fact checked with their own department about who spoke to our committee before they went into the newspaper and started criticising us. Minister Braddy also said that the report appeared to portray police as not being interested in working with Aborigines. If he had actually read the report instead of relying purely on limited press reports, he would have seen that the committee drew attention to some very successful police-Aboriginal relations occurring in Innisfail. I make the point that, wherever we were given information about improvements or positive changes that had occurred, we have commended the police services in Queensland and in other states for achieving those improvements.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So when any committee is reporting on the modern phenomenon of relations between police and Aborigines you would expect to find that information reported as well.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, Mr Braddy has not read the report because we have, in fact, included that information in the report on pages 260 and 261. Mr Braddy clearly has little idea of what is in the report that he is so vociferous in rejecting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Braddy has also claimed that the police internal report on the Roma Street incident, which we have included in our report, was the report of one officer. If Mr Braddy was at all familiar with the operations of his own Queensland police service, he would have known that there were five members of the review team, headed by Assistant Commissioner G. Williams who were responsible for that report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Braddy claims that neither he nor the commissioner were asked for input. Again, I reinforce the fact that our committee wrote to the Premier of Queensland on 7 March 1994 seeking a submission to the inquiry. We wrote again on 8 June inviting government representatives to appear at a public hearing, which they did. The committee took evidence from the state government, including from the Acting Deputy Commissioner of Police. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee is concerned about the lack of effective implementation of many of the royal commission's recommendations. Deficiencies were identified in the implementation by all governments, Commonwealth, state and territory. While the report focused primarily on deficiencies in the implementation process, this was with a view to having those deficiencies addressed. That was the whole point of our report. The purpose of us having the terms of reference was to find out where the deficiencies by governments, at the Commonwealth and at the state and territory levels, were occurring so that we could get the public debate going and try to improve that. We are seeking to improve government implementation of the recommendations that all state and territory governments and the Commonwealth have supported. They have supported 338 of the 339 recommendations, and they have an obligation to act to implement their commitments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rejection of the report by senior Queensland police and ministers before reading it typifies, in fact, the very attitudinal problems that the committee has criticised in the report. A more informed and constructive approach is desperately required if the royal commission recommendations are to be effectively implemented. There is an important process that we have recommended in our report in order to achieve a better implementation process. One of the major series of recommendations that we have outlined is for a new special unit&mdash;a monitoring and evaluation unit&mdash;to be established under the auspices of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner. We believe it is very important not to just have government departments at state and Commonwealth level sending in sheets of paper saying, `This is what we've done. This is our track record, as we claim it.' We have to have someone independent looking at those statements, evaluating them, and talking to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and organisations to find out whether the statements of the government departments are actually a true and accurate record of what is occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, there is no true evaluation of these statements. The only evaluation that has occurred is through this committee and we do not believe that it is appropriate that this committee should have to do this every year, 12 months after a report is tabled. We believe that that evaluation and that monitoring should be going on all the time, as an ongoing part of those government departments' implementation of the report. So we believe it is vital that a new special unit be established to ensure that there is effective, ongoing evaluation of all of the government departments. I might make the point that we have been critical of our own Commonwealth government and of a number of our Commonwealth departments as well. We are not letting anybody off the hook; we have commended government departments where they have done the right thing and we have criticised them where we believe they have not acted sufficiently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing that we were quite annoyed about, particularly in reading the implementation reports of the Commonwealth and a number of states, is that quite a number of the government responses to individual recommendations were, in fact, totally irrelevant to the actual royal commission recommendations that they were supposed to be commenting on. The royal commission had given a direction about a certain process that it felt should happen and the government, in writing its report about how it had implemented it, totally ignored what the recommendation was about and talked about something else altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there was a proper evaluation occurring, that would not be put in those implementation reports. That is why we believe it has got to stop; we have to have a much better evaluation and monitoring process, and it is absolutely crucial that Aboriginal and Islander people and organisations are involved in that process. Without that, there can be really no credibility in the implementation reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make the final point that it is crucial that governments at Commonwealth, state and territory level read the full report. I say to them not to reject its findings before they have had the opportunity to read what we have had to say. It is too important an issue and too important for us, as a country which espouses a great commitment to human rights, to ignore this very crucial issue in our own operation and delivery of human rights for people in this country. I urge the governments of the Commonwealth and all states and territories to read this report carefully, to implement the recommendations and to respond positively to it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join in this debate to discuss <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Justice under scrutiny: report of the inquiry on implementation by governments of the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody</EMPHASIS>. I have been in parliament now for about 18 months, maybe a bit longer, and I have been on two inquiries with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. I find the comments of the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) about human rights quite specific in relation to this particular committee because it is a humbling experience to travel to a number of Aboriginal communities around the countryside talking to Aboriginals about their basic needs and the problems they have with basic living standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During this particular committee inquiry, I was almost convinced by government members&mdash;federal and state governments&mdash;that there is nothing wrong with the Aboriginal community in Australia, that there are no problems: no criminal problems, no health problems, no education problems and no housing problems. We met delegation after delegation from governments saying that they are doing all these wonderful things and implementing all the recommendations. Yet, when we actually go out into the communities and out into Australia we see no results from any of this at all. I think it is a bit rich, as the member for Moreton was saying, that people say that there is nothing wrong and then bag our report, before they even read it. There are some serious, major problems in relation to the Aboriginal issue within Australia. They do not seem to be getting addressed by anyone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, we have been on two inquiries. The report of the first one was <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rhetoric or reality?</EMPHASIS> and was about the access and equity of Aboriginal communities into mainstream services within government. We presented this to the parliament 12 months ago, but we still have no response by the federal government. Yet I read some reports that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) was very concerned about this report being tabled and was saying, `Yes, we must do something about it.' We have not even had a response on last year's important human rights issues of equity and access to mainstream services. We have had no response back from the government. It is not just the federal government, it is not just the Queensland government; it is the New South Wales, Victorian, South Australian, Western Australian and Tasmanian governments&mdash;and even the Northern Territory government. They are not being responsible and implementing the recommendations. If they are, there is no evidence of that. I think they have to stand up and be more responsive to what we have been recommending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a number of leaders within the Aboriginal community who are very frustrated about what is happening.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before going to the division in the chamber, I was talking about the lack of action by governments. It is basically well known&mdash;by our committees, certainly; and, we hope, by the broader community generally, through our report&mdash;that there is nothing really happening of any serious nature with Aboriginal affairs in Australia. There is a lot of politicking about Aboriginal affairs, whether by the Aboriginal people themselves or by the broader community. People like to play politics; but what we are really doing when we do not take any action at all is playing off people's rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People talk about Aboriginal rights an awful lot. I do not think that this issue has anything to do with Aboriginal rights, but it has got a lot to do with basic human rights, as the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) was saying earlier. Recommendation 9.39 on page 213 of our report asks the Commonwealth government to introduce legislation within six months to `protect the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in accordance with Article 14, Clauses (a) (b) and (f) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.' Six months is not a long time for this government. Honourable members might recall the Tasmanian privacy issue. Legislation was developed very quickly there; and there is no reason why we cannot introduce legislation quickly within this place to give Aboriginal people their basic human rights when dealing with courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interpreter services in court are absolutely appalling for Aboriginal people. We need to address that problem and take some action on it. But we are getting the reverse of action: there is no action happening. We are getting a lot of reports done and there is a lot of talk, but there is no action; which makes one think that there must be something structurally wrong with the whole process. Maybe we did not set it up correctly years ago, when we started playing politics with this whole issue. The whole structure needs to be addressed, because the area of greatest need is the area suffering the greatest lack of human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to address this problem and find some positive solutions to it. We hope that this report, by discussing the royal commission into black deaths in custody, in some small way goes towards doing that. Along with rights come responsibilities and, depending on where one is in Australia, there are differing attitudes about what sort of responsibility is required from the Aboriginal people. For instance, people in Western Australia have a very different attitude from that of people in, say, Victoria, to things Aboriginal. So reconciliation is a very complex issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have just come back from southern Africa&mdash;Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa. I met someone who is now a minister in the Zimbabwean government but who had been in gaol for 14-odd years and had been tortured. One of the first things he did on becoming a minister was to promote one of the people who had been his torturers. Those southern African countries have a different attitude from ours to reconciliation. We need to take the politics out of reconciliation and get some meaningful reconciliation activity going, because it does not seem to be happening at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a fundamental structural problem, whether it is in the white or the black community. For instance, we do not seem to be talking about major problems within the community. We talk about the end result but we do not want to talk about alcohol and the problems it creates; instead we talk about other problems that are created by alcohol. But there is a serious problem with alcohol within the community. I think there is only one rehabilitation centre in the Northern Territory, and that one has just lost its funding. If we are really serious about addressing this issue we should be looking at the causes rather than the cures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is not much talk about AIDS within the Aboriginal community, but it is a growing problem. As well, the occurrence of STDs in the Aboriginal community is a major health problem, yet no-one seems to want to address it in any serious sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I call upon all governments, federal and state&mdash;perhaps even local governments&mdash;to become more serious about Aboriginal issues and to become actively involved, not just pay them lip service. I agree with the member for Moreton, who spoke of encouraging Aboriginal people to be part of the decision making and planning processes. It is no good going to them with plans and saying, `This is what we want you to do' and making a decision on it. We need fundamental planning processes coming from Aboriginal people so that we can actually help them to determine better what happens to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this is not only an issue for governments. It also requires Aboriginal organisations to get actively involved in order to allow some of the things to happen, for instance, Ninga Mia. We have all been to Ninga Mia, although we did not visit there this time. To allow such things to happen is just appalling and we should really all be working together to resolve them. We are not really serious about the issues at the moment, and we really have to get serious about them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the report is a good one and it contains a very solid 90 recommendations. The member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) has done an excellent job. She has been very passionate about the issue and that shows in the reporting process. I hope that governments and other organisations take the recommendations seriously and act upon them, unlike current media reports. I commend the report to the Committee. </PARA>

There is nothing more honourable for a person to be involved in than the pursuit of the elimination of injustice and inequalities, which, to a very large extent, underlies the matter that was addressed by the royal commissioner in the inquiry into and report on Aboriginal deaths in custody. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs was asked to report on the implementation by governments of the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and this report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Justice under scrutiny</EMPHASIS>, is the result of that inquiry. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr ROBERT BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we left to go to the division in the main chamber, I was referring to the fact that there are 90 recommendations in this report. That follows the royal commission report which contained 339 recommendations, 338 of which were adopted by this parliament. In that context, one would have been perfectly entitled to expect that in the process of examining the implementation of the recommendations everything would have come up looking good, but that was not the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer particularly to the members of the subcommittee who participated in that and to the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell), who acted as chair of the subcommittee. All committee members applied themselves in the way that I suppose we should expect members of parliament to apply themselves to the tasks that they have, but there is no question that these members did more than that. I would also like to mention our appreciation for the work of Allan Kelly and Craig Dukes, in particular, and their colleagues in the secretariat for their assistance during the inquiry and in the completion of the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the report to anyone who is concerned about the factors that gave rise to the royal commission and all of the factors that lie behind those depressing circumstances. There are probably too many separate elements to make reference to but I will mention a couple of things. When we are seeking to ensure that Aboriginal Australians are not incarcerated to the disproportionate extent that they are&mdash;in police custody, police cells, lock-ups or whatever&mdash;we need to look at all of the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are situations where police officers find their incomes significantly increased if they place Aboriginals in town lock-ups: it is known as a meal allowance. We have suggested that that should be abolished. It should never have existed. The amount to which some police officers have had their incomes enhanced as a result of that practice is significant. It has resulted in their earning in excess of twice what they would have earned in their basic salary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are concerned that funds allocated for specific purposes arising out of the royal commission report have been used for purposes other than those for which they were made available. We are concerned that some of the funds that were to assist in preventing the incarceration of Aboriginal people, and everything else that then gives rise to, were used to paint, improve and renovate police stations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other things that caused a lot of concern was the fact that, because Aboriginal people are disproportionately incarcerated, they get long lists of offences against their name. One of the offences is the `trifecta.' At one time, it was illegal for a person to be intoxicated in public. That has been eliminated, but it is now an offence to drink alcohol in a public place. If someone is drinking in a public place, and is apprehended by the police, it is possible that they will respond. If they do, they will find themselves charged with offensive behaviour. In the process of them saying, `No, don't arrest me, I haven't done anything wrong' they are resisting arrest. If they push the policeman, they are then guilty of assaulting a police officer. That is what is know as the `trifecta.' Some of these people have literally pages of those offences recorded against them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essential purpose should be to reduce the incarceration of Aboriginals. The fact is that the death rate of Aboriginals per 100 incarcerated Aboriginals is not significantly greater, and is in some cases less, than the death rates of non-Aboriginals per 100 of those prisoners. The thing that makes the difference is the disproportionately high number of Aboriginals who are themselves incarcerated, and everything that lies behind that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to summarise the situation with a comment that was made by Mr and Mrs Murray when the committee met with the Deaths in Custody Watch Committee in Sydney. Mr and Mrs Murray are the parents of Edward James Murray, who on 12 June 1981 was found dead, hung by a strip of blanket made into a noose, in a police cell in the Wee Waa police station. He was 21. We were concerned at that time about the amount of counselling which had taken place as a result of funds that were made available for counselling. Let me get this on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record today. These people were asked what they would like to say about counselling. Mrs Murray replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not need counselling. My family does not need counselling. We only want justice in this country. That is the only counselling we need.</PARA>
<PARA>Her husband said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam Chairman, if I may say so, I definitely can speak for each and every family that has lost someone in custody. I feel that a word like `counselling' to that family is insulting.</PARA>
<PARA>He said later:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not want some psych coming into my mind. I am not a mentally ill black fellow. All I want is one thing: justice.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course they are entitled to justice, and they are entitled to expect it from this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was concerned that there were some responses that were being made by people before they had read the report. It is obvious that some of those people who have made the responses have not read the report. I would appeal to them in a spirit of goodwill to do so, and not to damn the report and not to damn people associated with that inquiry before they read the report. We did not find it very comfortable to find points to criticise about the federal government, federal authorities and instrumentalities, and federal policies. We did not find it very comfortable either to do the same thing with our state colleagues. I know the same thing applies to members of the opposition in connection with conservative state governments. But one thing we were charged to do was to investigate and report on the implementation of those recommendations. That was the charge that we had and that was the charge that we sought to fulfil, and we did it well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Police Commissioner Jim O'Sullivan, in Brisbane, was reported as saying that he was `offended' and `extremely upset' by the committee's finding that deeply entrenched racist attitudes were held in the service, and as saying, `I totally reject this finding.' Also, he was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> as having said, `We do not tolerate that type of attitude in our service.' In a summary of Australian news, the same fellow was reported as saying&mdash;and I would ask him in a spirit of goodwill whether he does not understand that this comment of his is racist based&mdash;`I wonder how many law-abiding citizens within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community were interviewed.' He is quoted as having said that. What is the implication of that? It is that most Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders are criminals, most of them are not law-abiding and the only ones that we saw were people who were offenders. That is not correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to complete the comment with this: the whole process is continuing. I refer to `Murphy's Law', a column in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun-Herald</EMPHASIS>, a Sydney Sunday paper, where the following appeared in reference to the act of urinating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">White folks relieving themselves has always been good for a giggle in this column. Last year we told you how a Wollongong beak&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, a magistrate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">dismissed it as a "piddling offence".</PARA>
<PARA>Listen to the difference, though, when it involves an Aboriginal kid:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was no laughing matter for a 17-year-old Aborigine who was brought before Dubbo Children's Court recently charged with urinating on a white man's lawn in a NSW country town. As the shaken youth sat in court, Legal Service lawyer Mark Dennis said his client "has spent 20 hours in custody and has been dragged to court across many kilometres of winding country road in handcuffs in the back of a wagon holding on to the internal wire mesh so that he does not fall and injure himself."</PARA>
<PARA>The royal commission had demanded before that a juvenile should only be detained in exceptional circumstances. What did the courts do to this kid? They imposed $1,000 bail on him, which was impossible to meet. If he could not meet it, he stayed in custody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Dennis, the chap from the legal service, described the treatment of the youth as evil and disgraceful. He asked the magistrate to send a clear message to the town police in relation to this matter. He said they had abused their power and the processes of the court and that the refusal of bail was small-minded and vindictive. In connection with the police, he said: they are not a service; they are a force, and a force of which society should be ashamed. The magistrate dismissed the charge, as he should have done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that I make in raising that is to indicate that it continues. Those people who were sensitive in Queensland&mdash;Mr Braddy and Mr O'Sullivan&mdash;made not very generous responses, particularly to two of their colleagues who are honourable members of this place and dedicated, conscientious members. One of them is the chairman of the full committee, the other one is the chairman of the sub-committee, and they are entitled to more consideration and a little more respect for their effort, their conscientious approach to the question and the principles which they so courageously display. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Queensland thinks we singled it out, we did no such thing. We referred to ourselves as well. There is an example of something in New South Wales&mdash;my state. Are people suggesting to us that there is no entrenched racism in New South Wales when they treat a 17-year-old Aboriginal kid in the way I have described? It is a piddling offence if a white man urinates. It is matter of grave concern involving $1,000 cash bail, incarceration and humiliation for a black 17-year-old kid if he urinates. If we want any further confirmation of the need for the recommendations to be put into place, the report indicates the need and the comments that have been made by our good colleagues on both sides of the parliament, in confirming those recommendations, provide more evidence than we should ever need. </PARA>

I noticed in the papers this morning that, in my state of Victoria, the state minister was moved to say that, yes, at long last this week the Victorian parliament would get around to tabling its rather tardy response to the royal commission findings and its progress. It may be an accident of timing, but it seems a pity that a report which is as sweeping and condemning as this report about government action at all levels has to come out before governments start to do just the basics that they are required to do under the agreement that they have voluntarily entered into.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>many of its findings. I say that not to absolve myself of any responsibility, but to make it quite clear that I cannot claim too much credit for this report. I would like to acknowledge the work that the committee has done. It has done a very difficult thing in very trying circumstances and has come up with a fine report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I speak with some knowledge on these matters, having been for three years a member&mdash;in fact, the deputy chair&mdash;of this committee between 1990 and 1993, having been the shadow minister for a time whilst this inquiry was going on, and having been for three years a member of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. My travels around the country have enabled me to see and hear first-hand many of the things that have been produced in evidence in this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hesitate to break the mood of all of us saying how those people out there are terrible and how good a job we have done, but what this tome tells me is that perhaps the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) need to re-examine the policies that they are adopting in terms of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues. Whilst I do not dispute in any sense the good intentions of those two ministers in this respect, nevertheless it is important that we recognise that the policies that have been put in place in the last two or three years, on the evidence that is here, are patently not working. And we perhaps need a new approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us be quite clear that in this country the federal government has responsibility in this country for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and the 1967 referendum gave it that responsibility quite specifically. The government has been very loud in its protestations about what a wonderful record it has, how it is doing the right thing and how it is proud of its achievements. But the evidence in this report has been about for a long time, and the country&mdash;and the government in particular&mdash;have failed to resolve the problems. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government will tell us that we have a problem with the federalist system; the states have a lot of responsibility, and of course that is right. But equally the federal government provides most of the money, which is a very useful and clear way in which to exercise control. Obviously, the states have a large slice of responsibility but the federal government has the prime responsibility. This report tells us that all indicators show that we are seeing very limited, if any, improvement in most of the issues that were identified by the royal commission. There are some improvements but not a great number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go through the findings in some detail, but I think that has probably been done fairly exhaustively by other members of the committee. It may be noteworthy to say a couple of things about the actual findings. In the executive summary of the committee's report I draw attention to the sentence:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee was keen to ensure that the Royal Commission report and its recommendations is not allowed to gather dust on a shelf.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I for one will make sure if I possibly can that we keep this subject before the public in the coming years&mdash;whichever party is in power and whether it is the federal government or the state governments involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has also gone into some detail in terms of the ATSIC monitoring unit. It seems to me that the ATSIC monitoring unit has not been successful in what it was set up to do. I am not going to attack individuals, but it seems to me that the bottom line&mdash;whether we like it or not&mdash;is that the monitoring unit has not done the job that we hoped it would. If we say that, it is therefore important to acknowledge that, if it has failed and there do not appear to be easy ways to fix those problems, something has to be done. The committee has gone to some lengths to suggest a process for that to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context, I would like to give a message to the ATSIC commissioners. One of the criticisms I have of ATSIC commissioners is that over the last couple of years they have been all too defensive when people have tried to make constructive suggestions about the way that ATSIC has performed. It is not a question of attacking ATSIC. It is not a question of trying to do it down, or denigrate the process, or suggest that ATSIC is the wrong vehicle. All bureaucratic organisations&mdash;and ATSIC has its share of bureaucracy, the same as any other organisation&mdash;have their problems and ATSIC must expect to be accountable to the parliament. If the parliament asks questions and makes criticisms from time to time, ATSIC should be big enough to take those constructive criticisms on board. I would ask the ATSIC commissioners not to be ultra-defensive about the comments of the committee in regard to the monitoring unit; and to accept them in the spirit in which they are made, which is to try to improve the system for the benefit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen varying responses from the states, both to this report and to the previous royal commission report. Some have obviously responded better than others and I would hope that we can encourage all of them to lift their game. It is also important that a brief comment be made on the tardiness of action that we have seen in areas such as the recognition of Aboriginal customary laws. The Australian Law Reform Commission released its report on the recognition of Aboriginal customary law in 1986. We are nearly a decade on from that and we are still talking about the need to do something about recognising customary law. We are still talking about the need to recognise the differences in culture which account for many of the problems in this country in respect of indigenous people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We still have quite disgraceful statistics in terms of imprisonment: there is an over-representation of indigenous people in custody. In 1994, an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander person is still 19.4 times more likely to be locked up. That is a national disgrace. This is two years on from the royal commission. But it is 10 years on from when everybody recognised that it was the case. I believe that the minister and the Attorney-General should be much more pro-active in trying to redress those injustices at COAG and through other mechanisms. I do not think that it is sufficient to give this problem to the bureaucrats. There has to be the political will. In that sense, I would have to say that I am critical of the minister and the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bad performance of the police is not the only reason that people are in gaol. There are all those other socio-economic factors. It is not necessary to be an Aboriginal; one  can be an East German, or a Bosnian, or from some other country around the world where the pigmentation of the skin may be totally different. But if people have to endure appalling health, appalling housing, poor education and unemployment, they will get into trouble with the law and will be over-represented in gaol. We need to see much more done to address those basic issues, which is what justice and equity ought to be about in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I wish to refer to the executive summary that the committee has issued. I would like to quote that section where the committee talks about young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is concerned that there is too much emphasis on bureaucratic responses to the problems faced by indigenous youth and that there is not enough emphasis on community programs and solutions. The Committee is concerned that the government implementation reports it received outlined bureaucratic activity with insufficient attention paid to the delivery of services and the outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. They frequently involved a glossing over of the deficiencies in implementation rather than a critical evaluation of the processes. The committee found numerous examples of gross failures to implement the Royal Commission recommendations with crucial funding being used for internal bureaucratic conferences and meetings rather than community consultations and program delivery.</PARA>
<PARA>I have to say that this is often the case in many areas where money is allocated for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. It applies to white bureaucrats and black bureaucrats, right across the spectrum of federal and state government, and it is a major weakness in the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, we need to quite clearly change the monitoring process. I support the recommendations made by the committee in that respect. It is unfortunate, perhaps, that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Human Rights Commissioner, who it is proposed should control that method, is actually a government appointee. But I have to say, knowing Mick Dodson, that I think he has the personal character and strength of will to deal with the issues honestly, openly and fearlessly when he sees them. So I do not think we need to worry too much on that score. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only a question of monitoring more effectively. It is actually a question of trying to make sure that our programs in health, housing, education and so on are much better directed. It seems to me that state governments have to lift their game, the federal government has to lift its game, and so does ATSIC. Indigenous people must be more involved in the process. ATSIC is not sufficient, in my view, because it is not representative of the whole community. It may have the geographic spread but it only has 30-odd per cent of people voting for it. Many indigenous people out there will say that they do not believe ATSIC speaks for them. We have to have a wider input into the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we have to look at customary law. I think we have to look at cultural differences. And we have to get our house in order because it is right to do so for our indigenous people. But if we do not want to take a&mdash;if you like&mdash;moral stance, in terms of doing what is right for fellow Australians, let us do it if only to get our house in order in our international sense. How can we criticise the Indonesians? The chairman of this committee does that regularly&mdash;and good luck to him, and good strength to him. He will never get a ministry, of course, but he is right in what he says.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can we go into international forums if we do not have our own house in order? In the Great Hall on Tuesday night Archbishop Tutu said that we have to address these issues. One of the frightening things I found yesterday was when, as a member of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation and with three or four other members of that council, I met members of the visiting South African parliamentary delegation. They had already met the minister and heard what we were doing. We explained what we were doing with the reconciliation process, and their attitude was&mdash;this was from coloured members of the delegation&mdash;we think you are setting up an apartheid system. That is a very sobering thought that perhaps the committee might want to give more attention to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aboriginal people are angry, and rightly so, because there is no improvement. The wider community is angry because of wasted resources and no improvement. Let us be quite clear. It is not the Native Title Act that is going to fix these things, or the land fund&mdash;although they are all necessary. The problem lies with the will by government to get on with it. This government has had 10 years. It has to be more direct in the action it is taking because so far we have only scratched the surface. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No, the Government has no intention of changing its basic stance on foreign investment in Australia as a reaction to the oversubscription of a few public share floats. A more restrictive foreign investment policy might prejudice a successful outcome to future floats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Foreign ownership is already restricted in some circumstances. The Government's foreign investment policy is framed and administered with a view to encouraging foreign investment in Australia, while ensuring that such investment is consistent with the needs of the community. Under the Government's foreign investment policy, there are restrictions on foreign investment in sensitive sectors, namely the media, civil aviation, banking and real estate sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the non-sensitive sectors (including manufacturing, mining and services sectors), takeovers of existing Australian businesses with total assets less than $5 million and the establishment of new businesses involving total investment of less than $10 million are exempt from notification. Purchases of rural businesses valued at less than $3 million are also exempt. The Government registers, but normally raises no objections to proposals above these thresholds where the relevant total assets/total investment fall below $50 million. Examinable proposals to acquire existing businesses or to establish new businesses are assessed against a "contrary to the national interest" test. Investors can expect that approval will not be withheld on national interest grounds other than in unusual circumstances affecting Australia's vital interests and development. Portfolio investments normally are not covered by Australia's foreign investment policy. </PARA>
