<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister is asking questions across the table which I would prefer not to answer at this time, but I would be very happy to talk to the minister privately. If the minister wishes to know, the name of the councillor is Sharon Firebrace. The interview was about the indigenous land fund. In reply to a question about the amendment we are discussing today, the amendment which the minister said had no support from Aboriginal people, Sharon said, `It is vital that the bill must have this amendment in it.' So much for this minister claiming that nobody in the Aboriginal community wants these amendments. What the minister means is that the people he has talked to and the people he is getting to act on his behalf do not want this amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">May I say how disappointed I was in the minister's trying to raise controversy over these amendments when on Sunday he sent to the press his own press release calling for the total support of the coalition on this fund and at the same time orchestrated several Aboriginal groups to send almost identical press releases. What does this say about the minister's approach to this amendment? Does the minister really want to set Aboriginal person against Aboriginal person, saying that these Aboriginal people support the government and these Aboriginal people support the opposition? <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the minister: if that is the sort of game he really wants to play, it is not in the interests of the Aboriginal people and it is not in the interests of the wider Australian community, which is looking for reconciliation on this issue, which genuinely wants reconciliation and which does not want to see the government playing politics at the expense of the Aboriginal community. I turn to some of the quite interesting points the minister raised in his speech yesterday. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the coalition again seeks to fetter, constrain and restrict the board of the Indigenous Land Corporation.   </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet it was this very minister who, when the coalition tried to widen the debate on this issue, said that we were acting against the interests of Aboriginal people. When the coalition put forward an amendment which would widen the powers of the Indigenous Land Corporation, what did the minister say? The minister said, `You can't do this.' But on this amendment, the minister accuses us of trying to fetter the ILC. So what is an argument from the minister on one of these amendments turns out to be an opposite argument on another amendment. I turn to the second of the minister's arguments. Yesterday, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conversely, it may be that there are areas which are owned under native title and can be proven before the Native Title Tribunal which are of great cultural significance, but which may be of relatively little economic development potential for that community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think this amendment indicates better than any other the nature of the fraud that is involved in the amendments generally that are being moved to this legislation. I refer to a comment that was made by Mike Seccombe in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> a few days ago. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Party opposes the whole idea.&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, of the land fund&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So do a lot of the Liberal Right. But to try to maintain some pretence of progressiveness, the Libs are persevering with the fiction that they only want to amend it.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, of course, the objective of the opposition in this matter. As I have said, this particular amendment, better than any of the others, gives evidence of that. It refers to the need to give priority in the purchase of certain land, the need to ensure that certain land is not acquired. That reflects in the first place quite a clear lack of confidence in the proposed Indigenous Land Corporation and the responsibilities that the land corporation will have in fulfilling its tasks under that legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But even more important is the last reference, to the need to give the upgrading of Aboriginal pastoral property priority. That is a completely different issue, as the opposition well knows. This legislation is concerned with setting up a fund to make it possible for land to be purchased for those Aboriginal people who have been so dispossessed that they can no longer now indicate or prove any continuing association with the land on which they currently live or any land with which they may have had some previous relationship over the last 60,000 years. That is the purpose of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose one would almost feel excused in showing some sympathy for the opposition, knowing the very serious disability that it operates under in connection with these amendments. The most serious disability is the fact that the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) is the shadow minister. We well recall the fiasco just recently when, in connection with issues of this kind, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) had a tour through the Northern Territory. He took with him the shadow minister to act as his adviser. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tour turned into a fiasco and that had the effect of turning the Leader of the Opposition into a figure of ridicule as far as Australia was concerned. It was also this shadow minister who bravely asserted in connection with this issue and this legislation, after she was appointed as shadow minister, that she would be supporting the land fund and she would swing the opposition. They swung her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister was soon pulled into line by the Leader of the Opposition. She went to water. I said yesterday that there was a possibility of her, depending upon the elements of goodwill on the part of the opposition, being able to carry the opposition on this matter. She has shown no courage and no competence. She has become a joke as far as her responsibilities are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, when we had a group of national Aboriginal Australian leaders sitting in the gallery, she deliberately offended them. One of them was the Deputy Chairperson of ATSIC, Charles Perkins. The reason she offended and insulted the people in the gallery&mdash;they were in a position where they could not respond&mdash;was that the minister quite courteously acknowledged their presence with a smile. She used that as an opportunity to insult and offend them. She has no more likelihood of surviving in her position than the Leader of the Opposition does. She is incompetent. She is a failure. The best thing for her to do is to save herself and the opposition any further embarrassment by resigning from her shadow portfolio. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) was offended yesterday when I said that he had passed his use-by date. We have had some sort of reaction by the honourable member for Charlton. I am sorry that he was offended. I am glad that he got to his feet because, in doing so, he has supported our amendment. It seems that he is a little confused, but even in his confusion we are grateful for his support of our amendment. This fund is meant for people who have been dispossessed and who cannot claim under native title. I thank him for his support. He is a little confused in that he does not realise that the government's own bill directs funds to the upgrading and maintenance of properties. In questioning that, he is questioning his own bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member keeps saying that we are opposed to the land fund bill, which shows that he has not followed the debate. I refer him to the speech of his own Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;I quoted this yesterday but I will quote it again&mdash;in which he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the event, the veracity of the opposition's recent claims of concern for indigenous people will be tested by two events&mdash;the vote on the second reading in the House of Representatives . . .</PARA>
<PARA>What did the coalition do when voting on the motion for the second reading? There were no dissenting votes, which showed our support at the second reading stage. If the honourable member wishes to come into this House and enter the debate, first of all, he should read his own government's bill and, secondly, he should follow the debate to see what has been said by the minister and the Prime Minister. If he did so, he would not continue to make such an absolute fool of himself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important for us to understand the motivation behind amendments of this kind so that we can better assess the value which they may or may not contribute to the legislation finally. The government has made it clear that it does not and will not accept these amendments. To a very large extent, this exercise must involve, as it does, a filibuster by the opposition in an attempt to ensure that the legislation is delayed for as long as possible. This bill will pass through this chamber as soon as we have disposed of these amendments, as the opposition knows. It will then go to the Senate. It is the intention of the opposition in the Senate to refer the bill, as it has said, to a Senate select committee for consideration, despite the fact that for hours and days this chamber has given detailed consideration to the proposed amendments which the opposition has brought forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one other point I want to make in connection with this matter: the legislation provides for funds to be made available for the purchase of land, under the provisions of this legislation, 30 days after royal assent. Let that not go unnoticed: 30 days after the legislation is given assent the funds will be made available; so that for every day the opposition continues to delay this legislation the funds will not be available and those most seriously dispossessed Aboriginal people who would benefit from the application of this legislation will not be given an opportunity to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is relevant as well for us to acknowledge the fact that the shadow minister has found it necessary to have with her all the time the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan). She is supposed to be the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs; she is supposed to be able to act as an adviser to the opposition. But she has had her hand held by the honourable member for Barker on every occasion that we have given consideration to this matter. The honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) is one of the best informed members of the opposition in connection with Aboriginal affairs. He is one of the most genuine and committed; and he is a former shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs. It is the honourable member for Aston who, in connection with these amendments, should be at the dispatch box looking after the interests of the opposition. He would do it with some level of competence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No-one, I suggest, has raised the decibel level here more than the member for Charlton has. I suggest that he take a leaf out of the Speaker's book; he has now reduced his decibel level and I am hoping that that will be a permanent change in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will raise two points. One is that the member for Charlton said the last time we were in this chamber on this matter&mdash;and said again today&mdash;that this land fund was supposed to be for those Aboriginals who were so dispossessed of their previous land that they were not able to acquire title under the Native Title Act. Not only did he say that but it was stated on page 3 of the preamble to the Native Title Bill. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also important to recognise that many Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders, because they have been dispossessed of their traditional lands, will be unable to assert native title rights and interests and that a special fund needs to be established to assist them to acquire land.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, when we put in an amendment which says exactly that, no matter what, those opposite will disagree with it. The member for Charlton said that just a minute ago. He said, `No matter what it is, we the government are going to oppose it.' It does not matter what amendment we put here&mdash;the government will oppose it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know why the government could not put this clause in the bill. The minister, the government and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) were telling us that all these claims under the Native Title Act would be quickly fixed. The fact is that if we do not know who is going to get native title, because the claims will go on and on with court case after court case and decision after decision, we cannot acquire land under an acquisition fund for those people who are not going to get some benefit from native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government had to change its whole tack because its arrangements under the Native Title Act have turned out to be hopelessly inefficient and are not going to work. So it is terrible hypocrisy of this government to say that it is against the first clause of our amendment&mdash;that is exactly what it said in the Native Title Bill explanatory memorandum. I will read it again. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recognising that many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people will be unable to secure native title and to benefit directly from the High Court decision, the Bill establishes a National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund.</PARA>
<PARA>Clause 192 of the bill was principally devoted to the acquisition of land. Of course, when we put forward that simple clause, in almost your own words, you will oppose it because you will oppose anything we suggest, however good it is or however much you might in fact have approved of it in times past. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that this is one of the amendments the coalition is going to call a division on. Therefore, it is appropriate that I respond to at least some of the things that have been said in the course of this debate. I must say, we have had a very revealing contribution from the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan). In that contribution we saw yet again the strident opposition of a very senior coalition frontbench member to the Native Title Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rest of the world knows that those in the coalition who determine Aboriginal affairs policy are the people who have contributed very much to this debate. The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) is well known for his sympathy for the Aboriginal cause. The member for Barker, only a matter of four months ago, went on the public record and gave an ironclad commitment not only that the Native Title Act would be repealed but also that the land fund bill would not be supported. The member for Barker cannot deny that. He has always been opposed to the land fund and he got his way because the coalition has adopted a policy that simply leaves the government no alternative but to proceed with its bill. These are not genuine amendments. They are not amendments that have been put forward by the coalition in any attempt to improve the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me record the history of the government's attempts to get the land fund package right as a negotiated outcome. Firstly, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) wrote to the former Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), a matter of four or five months ago. The Prime Minister also wrote to the state and territory leaders, to the National Farmers Federation and to other industry bodies because he, like the rest of the government, wanted to get the best bill. Despite that letter to the coalition, no response was forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, when the legislation was introduced into the House of Representatives not two weeks ago, not three weeks ago, not a month ago, but two months ago, the Prime Minister wrote again to the new Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) and invited him, in a spirit of goodwill and cross-party cooperation, to put forward proposals for improvements to the bill. Not only was there not a reply over that period of weeks and months, but it was in fact at the eleventh hour, when the bill was to be debated in the House of Representatives, that members in this chamber were seeking to get information about the coalition amendments. What we got was a cobbled together version of some amendments that were first described by the coalition as a refocus of the bill with significant amendments. If we search the public record, we will see that that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now find that on the ABC radio program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia Talks Back</EMPHASIS>, the shadow minister described the amendments as `some slight changes'. Only one week ago she described the amendments in their totality as `very slight'. Given that, by the coalition's own admission, these are very slight amendments, will the coalition support the bill when it comes to a vote in the House of Representatives?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The available information we have suggests that at least some members of the coalition, including members of the frontbench, would like to do just that. This morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> reports:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Several senior Liberal MPs are "angry and dismayed" over Opposition Leader Alexander Downer's staunch refusal to back the Aboriginal land fund.</PARA>
<PARA>Well may they be angry and dismayed! Twenty years ago in this chamber Sir Billy Snedden&mdash;and before him Sir William McMahon&mdash;speaking for the coalition of yesteryear was prepared to support land acquisition by Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1974 a fund was established with the unanimous support of this parliament. That fund was the fledgling effort of the Commonwealth to address the position and rights of dispossessed people. Twenty years on we find that the coalition has turned back the clock: it will not support the government's bill. These so-called amendments are just a smokescreen to hide that strident opposition. When the legislation goes to the Senate there will be more amendments and an attempt to establish a Senate inquiry&mdash;every trick in the book will be used to try to stop this legislation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I really cannot let that ridiculous tirade pass without making a comment or two.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the minister comes from New South Wales. I do not recall how much land has been provided to Aboriginals by successive New South Wales governments, but my guess is that it is of the order of the size of one sheep station. Twenty per cent of the land of my state has been provided for Aboriginals, and more will eventuate. That land has been provided by the state government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hypocrisy that comes out of Victoria and New South Wales on this matter of looking after Aboriginals is starting to annoy me somewhat. The state from which the minister emanates has not provided land worth a damn to Aboriginals&mdash;and Victoria has provided less. One cannot even measure it; it is not statistically measurable on any piece of paper that one can get from a Victorian government department.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the minister to get up here, bleed his heart all over the floor of this chamber and not tell the truth is starting to annoy some of us to the point where we will have to do something about it publicly. The minister generalises every time he gets on the radio and raises these sorts of issues. The shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs and I are simply asking the minister to look at the amendment. The honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) has already said that he agrees with amendment No. 1. In fact, he gave a rather heated dissertation on the subject.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important that we keep in mind the particular amendment with which we are dealing. The honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) and the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) have made claims in connection with our response to this and other proposed amendments that simply cannot be substantiated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that there are two essential elements of the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill, the first being the land acquisition function and the second being the land management function. Those opposite are attempting to claim that paragraph (f), which amendment No. 13 seeks to add to proposed subsection 191N(2), is designed in some way to complement or to improve the land management function. It does no such thing. The land management function within the context of this legislation is able to stand by itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This part of the amendment suggests that, within the context of the national indigenous land strategy, there is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the need to give the upgrading of Aboriginal pastoral properties priority over the acquisition of land in areas where there are already substantial land holdings by Aboriginal people or corporations.</PARA>
<PARA>That proposal does a number of things. The first thing it does is deliberately confuse the purpose of this legislation and particularly the provision in this legislation for land management considerations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is an important provision. We would not retreat from that, but there are other considerations as well. In the context of proposed new paragraph (f), how would it be possible for the Indigenous Land Corporation to deal with a critical and important sacred site in an area where there are already substantial land holdings by Aboriginal people or corporations? How would it be possible for the Indigenous Land Corporation in a physical situation to give consideration to the purchase of land on which Aboriginals are actually living? I do not know where these proposals came from, but when we make the claim&mdash;and this claim is echoed by people around Australia&mdash;that this is a deliberate ploy on the part of the opposition to delay, to frustrate, to circumvent and to damage this legislation we make it on good grounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Barker made an interesting point in his most recent contribution to this debate on this amendment. When defending South Australia, he said that 20 per cent of the state had been made available to Aboriginal people. Let it be clearly seen on the record that this accords with the claim made by a member of the National Party some time ago that Aboriginal Australians, who represent something like three per cent of the Australian population, have ownership of about 17 per cent of Australia. It is said that a disproportionate area of Australia is under their ownership and control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know what that land is. If it was any good they would not have been allowed to keep it. The most productive areas, the coastal areas, the fishing areas and the areas where settlement was possible were acquired and alienated by European Australians. We left Aboriginal people in the desert. We left them 17 per cent of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone knows that South Australia is essentially a desert state. The 20 per cent of South Australia that the Aboriginal people have been allowed to have, acquire or keep is obviously the worst part of the desert. I bet they are not grazing many stock per hectare. That claim is a deliberate attempt to misrepresent the situation and make it appear that Aboriginal Australians in some way have been given a fair deal with land. They have not. </PARA>

<PARA>How that could be taken as an insult to the members of the Aboriginal community, I do not know. But I want to clarify the record by giving the absolute assurance that there was never any insult intended to any member of the Aboriginal community, and the only insult perhaps that was intended concerned the behaviour of this minister, who has promoted division. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to address my comments to the minister, who unfortunately is engaged in another conversation. I would like him to listen to what I have to say. Minister, you know very well that the divisiveness of this debate need not have gone on and that I came to you and said, `Yes, we will give you in principle support for this fund, but I would like you to come back to us and have a look at our amendments.' This was an olive branch. You could have rung me up and said, `Okay, Chris, let us sit down and discuss these amendments.' If you had been genuine, that is what you would have done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You may not have agreed with the amendments; we may not have been able to come to an agreement on some of them. But when that was all done it would have been seen by the population that, although the coalition and the government disagreed on some of the amendments, their goal was a united one and was for the benefit of the Aboriginal people. But this minister deliberately and utterly took the decision to play politics. Despite the fact that he goes around the country calling for bipartisanship, when bipartisanship is offered he turns his back and says, `No, we will play politics.' He has played politics from the very beginning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have referred before to the minister's efforts. He sent out letters to the churches saying to them, `I urge you to urge the coalition to support the land fund.' Did he come to the shadow minister and say, `Let's sit down and talk about how we can get together on this.'? No, he did not. He sent letters straight to the churches. At the weekend he sent out press releases saying, `I urge the coalition to come out and support it fully,' which we had done, I might say, in the second reading debate. Did the minister send that press release to me? Did he phone me up? No, he sent that press release to the press and then he got the Aboriginal people to send the same one. Did it appear in the press? I got phone calls from members of the press, and they were laughing at these efforts of the minister who unfortunately has soiled his own reputation in this debate because he can no longer go around the country, as he has been doing, claiming bipartisanship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been very disappointed in the minister. I was disappointed in the minister when I attended a meeting of the Central Land Council where I heard him take credit for what bipartisanship had been achieved under the previous Prime Minister, Prime Minister Hawke. I heard the minister say, `I did this. I achieved this. I got bipartisanship.' Did I once hear the minister refer to the coalition's previous shadow minister, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), and give him credit? Not one word was mentioned of the honourable member for Chisholm, who had worked so hard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was not one mention of credit to the member for Chisholm, but when the government was asked why it had not done certain things, do you know what the reason was? It was, `The coalition won't let us.' Every time this minister gets on his feet he cannot resist mentioning the coalition, and he mentioned it in such an inappropriate place as a meeting of the reconciliation council which was being videotaped and at which everyone was being non-political except the minister, who stood up and mentioned the coalition. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

As that area is in my electorate, I want to make the point that it is not poor land; it is the land on which the Aboriginal people have lived for thousands of years; it is their land. Many Aboriginals criticise this legislation because, under the current land rights act which is administered by the state government, they no longer have access to that land in a way which is culturally appropriate to them and which would allow them to move into the 21st century with appropriate economic benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stress to the minister and to the honourable member for Charlton that much of the Pitjantjatjara land is recognised as some of the best cattle country in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make some pertinent points about our proposed amendment to the bill. Firstly, the amendment that the coalition has put forward was exactly the reason that the land fund was mentioned by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Earlier in the debate I quoted from a letter that the Prime Minister wrote to Marshall Perron in the Northern Territory. He said that the land fund is for Aboriginal people who cannot benefit under the Native Title Act. This amendment will simply add to this bill that very important goal which all Aboriginal people thought would appear in the bill. It has been supported by Aboriginal people as recently as last night on the ABC.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot allow the shadow minister to get away with this. Everyone knows that this effort on the part of the opposition is fraudulent. The purposes are not to improve the legislation; the purposes are to destroy the legislation. The shadow minister has indicated on the record that she did not discuss the opposition's proposed amendments with the Aboriginal community. As she just indicated, she gets her information about Aboriginal attitudes from the television. She then misrepresents the response of the Aboriginal people by referring to the comments of one ATSIC commissioner. She claims that what that one ATSIC commissioner has said represents the interests and the attitudes of Aboriginals right across Australia. It does not.

He has just misrepresented the shadow minister's position who, in the time that she has had this position, has been assiduous in getting around the Aboriginal industry and making sure that she listens to its views. To make sure the minister understands that not everybody in the Aboriginal industry is with him, I will quote from a paper that was put out in Western Australia called `The Lawman's Vision'. There were quite a lot of rather revealing things said in that paper. One was about the gas pipeline company. Amongst other things, the paper said:</PARA></TALK.START>

".</PARA>
<PARA>Amendment No. 14 is a very minor amendment and deals with clause 3, page 11, lines 11-13 of proposed subsection 191N(6). Amendment No. 15 is much more substantial. I refer in particular to parts (7) and (8). The reason for these amendments is simply one of accountability of the ILC. Organisations that have a responsibility for spending public money&mdash;and especially organisations that are responsible for providing the best possible benefit to Aboriginal people&mdash;should be accountable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, recently we have had in the newspapers distressing accounts of money that has been meant for Aboriginal people going astray and not reaching the communities it has been meant for. Since I have taken on this portfolio, not a week has gone past when I have not received phone calls from members of Aboriginal communities saying, `We have money that was directed to this community. Something has happened to it. Either it has been misappropriated or for some reason we have not got the money we expected to have because of some sort of failure of administration.' That is distressing to the Aboriginal community but, worse than that, by the time this is reported in the press it is often taken to reflect on the Aboriginal community. So Aboriginals are twice losers: they lose out when their community does not get the money that was earmarked for it; and they lose out when somehow they are deemed to be responsible for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Aboriginal people approach me they say, `Look, we want to get out of this. These funds must be as accountable as any other fund.' They say, `To have it any other way is total paternalism.' To think that Aboriginal funds have to be treated in different ways is paternalism. This is why we have moved that the ILC&mdash;which is responsible for the granting of this money&mdash;put forth a strategy. The ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994 itself gives absolutely no goals to the ILC. It does not say what the goal of the ILC is or what direction it should take. The only thing the bill does in relation to giving direction to the spending of the funds and the investment of the funds while they are waiting to be spent is state that the ILC has to have a national land strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is no requirement that that national land strategy actually be formulated before the ILC goes out and spends funds. It is possible to have the ludicrous situation where the ILC, responsible to Aboriginal communities to spend money on behalf of Aboriginal communities in a logical and sensible way&mdash;in a way that assists Aboriginal communities&mdash;could go ahead and start the purchase of property or some other strategies before it had drawn up that national strategy. These are important amendments and we wish to add them to the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to explain why the government is not prepared to accept the amendments. The first amendment proposes to impose a requirement on the Indigenous Land Corporation board to give a copy of its strategy to the minister within two months of the board agreeing to the strategy or making the change. There is a very simple reason why the government does not accept this amendment. It is yet another example of why these cobbled together amendments have been rejected by most key Aboriginal organisations and representatives around the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason the amendment is not accepted is that there already exists a much stronger power in the legislation. I direct the honourable member's attention to clause 191N(6) of the bill, which already requires the Indigenous Land Corporation to do this on request. The amendments, therefore, are unnecessary. I see the shadow minister on the telephone calling for reinforcements, and well might she call for the reinforcements because of the paucity of the arguments presented by the coalition in respect of this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is even a more substantial power conferred on the minister under clause 191M(1) of the bill, which is the general power of the minister to seek information. As the minister who will be responsible for the Indigenous Land Corporation, I have to tell the shadow minister that, if the board took six weeks or two months to furnish me with a copy of that key strategy document, I would be very angry. It is a woefully inadequate amendment. As the minister, I will give an undertaking that, pursuant to the power that I will have under clause 191M(1) of the bill, I will be asking the Indigenous Land Corporation to furnish me with a copy of that strategy forthwith. But it is a power I already have and it is a power that I would use. Therefore, the entire amendment is unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment is probably one of the most insidious of the amendments forming part of the coalition package, despite the fact that they are now being described by the coalition as rather minor. I challenge the opposition&mdash;the shadow minister can rise to her feet after I have spoken if she wishes to do so&mdash;to tell me which other similar organisation has a requirement not only for its strategic documents to be tabled in the parliament but also to confer on a potentially opposition controlled Senate the power to disallow the core document that would allow the land fund to function. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it any wonder that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, most of the key land councils around this country and informed Aboriginal opinion have rejected absolutely this attempt by the coalition to further sabotage this bill by including the clause in the legislation? The fact is that a commercial operation, properly working within its charter, should not have its operations potentially paralysed by a hostile Senate, especially one motivated by the sort of anti-Aboriginal sentiment we so often see manifested on the opposition side of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to emphasise that clause 191R(1) of the bill imposes a mandatory requirement on the Indigenous Land Corporation to make a copy of the national indigenous strategy or the regional indigenous land strategy available to any person who wants one. That is, it would be made available not just to the minister but to any person who wants a copy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we heard from the shadow minister was a very disappointing smear on Aboriginal people and the issue of public accountability. The shadow minister said that public accountability in Aboriginal affairs was inadequate. I remind the House that the ATSIC legislation was unanimously supported by this parliament&mdash;that includes the shadow minister and the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan). If there is something wrong with that public accountability why did any of you not rise to move some amendments in the course of the debate on the ATSIC legislation? The answer is: because it is the most publicly accountable statutory authority in this country. It should not be the role of the shadow minister to smear indigenous people and their organisations every time she rises to her feet just because she happens to think there are a few votes in it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When these people come to me they also say, `We have rung Robert Tickner's office. We have asked for help from the minister and it has not been forthcoming.' In the points I have made there has been no slur on Aboriginal people. The slur is on this government because Aboriginal people have not got the funds that were meant for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister asked me to list some other organisations that have disallowable instruments. I asked the Parliamentary Library for this information and it sent to my office five pages of disallowable instruments. Under the ATSIC Act of 1989 the disallowable instruments are, I believe, sections 4A, 40, 113, 116, 119, 127C, 130, 138 and 194. Disallowable instruments are not unusual. </PARA>

Read my words in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and see whether you can find anything that I have said that constitutes a slur on Aboriginal people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too heard what was said by the shadow minister. I have to concur with what was said by the minister in his contribution. The second of these two amendments reveals the agenda of the opposition. Using its numbers in the Senate, it wants to be able to frustrate the ambitions of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. That is very clear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I saw an interesting article in one of the newspapers today. It quoted an unnamed frontbencher from the opposition. That frontbencher was lamenting the fact that the opposition was not going to support the land title fund. The article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> by Kim Sweetman states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A key frontbencher yesterday revealed sections of the party wanted to support the Government's Aboriginal land acquisition fund legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not doubt that that is true. Those people in the party recognise, no doubt, the validity of the government's attempts to pass this legislation through this House. They have seen through the tawdry attempts, as the minister has said, of the opposition to frustrate attempts by Aboriginal people to manage their own affairs as they would want them to be managed and as we want them to manage them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is saying to Aboriginal people, `You cannot make assessments or judgments. You have to table them in the House and they will be made a disallowable instrument.' That is what the amendment says. The opposition says to them, `If we do not like the fact that you are going to purchase particular sets of properties around Australia we will disallow it.' Why would the opposition disallow it? It may not like the fact that they happen to be buying into country which it might want other people to purchase. Could it be that? Let us ask ourselves what the motives behind the opposition's approach to this particular issue are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not normally a cynical person, but one would have to approach the propositions of the opposition with a degree of cynicism. There is nothing surer than that the government will oppose this amendment, yet the opposition's support for the government's legislation rests on our accommodating its amendments. If the opposition were at all genuine in approaching the issue of the support of the land fund in a bipartisan manner it would see the amendment for what it really is: an attempt to obstruct and subvert the interests of Aboriginal people as represented by the ILC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister's saying that Aboriginal people have been ringing her on a regular basis saying that funds have been diverted now takes a slightly different tack. Funds are not being diverted by Aboriginal people; they are being diverted by white bureaucrats. That is not a bad turn, but I suspect that nothing can be proven. They are allegations of misappropriation about which the shadow minister has no proof, and allegations which she should not raise unless she has some proof. She should not malign people who are working for and on behalf of Aboriginal people through ATSIC. I assume that is the organisation she is talking about because it has the bulk of funds appropriated to Aboriginal people in this country through the federal government's programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Or is she talking about misappropriation through state government agencies? In that case, she should say so. Let us ask which state governments she is talking about. If we are talking about the use of government funds, if people in this House are saying, `Let us have a disallowable instrument on the way in which state governments use funds which are made available by the federal government,' then let it come from the opposition. As the minister rightly pointed out, the fact is that this is a tawdry political stunt by the opposition. There is no way the government will support these amendments. The shadow minister knows that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) has recently said&mdash;I am not sure what they call him these days: Bozo?&mdash;that if the government does not support these amendments the opposition will not support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On a point of clarification, the point of having a disallowable instrument was simply to show that the strategy had been formed. It would not refer to individual parcels of land. The idea is that the strategy would be presented to parliament, the parliament would determine that there was in fact a strategy in place and that that strategy was in accordance with the act. After that, the strategy would be put in place by whatever the ILC determined. That is just a point of clarification.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Despite the clarification provided by the shadow minister, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), that is not what her amendment says. Amendment No. 15 is very strongly and vigorously objected to by the government and will be opposed by the government for a very simple reason. The shadow minister might suggest that it is a very innocent proposal, a very innocent process, whereby the land strategy becomes a disallowable instrument, but the fact is that once it becomes a disallowable instrument in this House or in the Senate it can be obstructed or blocked for any reason.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worst part of it is that part of the amendment which proposes a new subsection (8) to make it a disallowable instrument, followed by proposed new subsection (9), which says that no moneys can be expended at all, no purchases of land can be made at all, until a new strategy that is approved by the House of Representatives and the Senate is put in place. Therefore, it can very easily become a manipulated process whereby the Senate continues to block and block and block, and continues to say, `This strategy is not acceptable for reason X, reason Y or reason Z.' Meanwhile, no funds are expended and no land is being purchased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly concerned that the shadow minister once more has raised allegations of misappropriation of funds. Once more, we have the process happening in this parliament where Aboriginal organisations or organisations which are supplying services to Aboriginal communities or groups are accused of misappropriation of funds. This allegation is made continually, particularly in the Senate but also in this House. It was the manner in which Aboriginal debates occurred in this House for eight to 10 years. On every single occasion that those allegations were made and there was a subsequent inquiry by the Auditor-General, by standing committees or by a whole range of other organisations there has never been any shred of evidence to prove the allegations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very easy to come into this place and accuse people of misappropriating funds. But those opposite are very silent when the Auditor-General tables a report in this place which says there is no evidence of misappropriation of funds. That is what occurred just recently. The Auditor-General conducted an inquiry into the Northern Land Council. That organisation had been subjected to vicious attack in the Senate, with allegations made about misappropriation and misuse of funds. But when the Auditor-General's office conducted a major inquiry into the Northern Land Council it found no evidence at all of misappropriation of funds. Did any opposition senator who had made those allegations get up in the Senate and say, `I'm sorry, I was wrong, I apologise for misleading the Senate; I apologise for besmirching the reputations of those people'? No, and it will not happen on this occasion either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very easy to bandy about allegations of misappropriation of funds but it is not so easy to prove them because in the vast majority of cases they do not exist; there has been no misappropriation of funds. What has often occurred is that particular groups have been unhappy that their proposal has not been funded but another organisation's proposal has been funded. So they ring up opposition members and say, `Look, organisation X has got this money; we should have got this money. There is some funny business going on. The ATSIC regional councils are rigging this to suit themselves,' and opposition members are falling for that line. They see this as some great evidence of misappropriation of funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable members know, there is never enough money in the pool to satisfy all the communities' needs. That is one of the points that all the regional councils will tell us&mdash;that they have 100 submissions for funding and they only have money to fund 15 or 20. Of course, that is always going to be the case. There will always be a greater level of demand than there is funding to support those submissions. But for the shadow minister to accuse the regional councils, the white bureaucrats who run ATSIC or whoever it is that she might be accusing of misappropriating funds because they make deliberate, strategic decisions to fund one organisation over another is a misuse of her role as shadow minister and an abuse of her position as a member of parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) for his very sincere contribution to this debate. It stands in stark contrast to the contribution made by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As one aside, I would not want to feel that I had misled the parliament in any way on this matter when I said before that I had in my room what looked like five or six pages of disallowable instruments. In fact, all I have with me at the moment&mdash;and I am not sure that this is the total list because it starts with the Telecommunications Act&mdash;is three pages of all types of disallowable instruments that come before the parliament, probably 99.9 per cent of which pass without comment. One that I have picked out, for no good reason, is the Fisheries Act management plans. They are a disallowable instrument, as are all the others on this paper. That is simply to correct something I had said before about the number of pages of disallowable instruments I had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Moreton has made a very valid point. I thought I had made it very clear&mdash;if I had not, I will reiterate it&mdash;that there is not an accusation against any particular group or anything else. But we do see, with horrible regularity, suggestions in the newspapers of misuse&mdash;mismanagement is probably a better word&mdash;of funds. In Victoria, Ian Viner has been appointed to investigate some such charges. I think this causes enormous distress to all of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are asking for is that when this strategy is drawn up and given to parliament it be drawn up in such a way that management goes ahead. The management should be clear so that everybody can see, ahead of time, the structure that has been put there so that there is no danger of these accusations and problems occurring. People should know how the organisation is working. They should know that there is a strategy of how government, public and Aboriginal funds will be distributed to the community and they should be able to see how that strategy is working, and that the strategy appears to be like all other disallowable instruments before parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know this House has a very low opinion of the Senate, but to suggest that the Senate would quite maliciously single out this particular strategy for special treatment is perhaps unfair to the other place. If those opposite are suggesting that the combination of the Liberal Party, the National Party, the Greens and the Australian Democrats will disallow this instrument, then perhaps there would be something wrong with the way the strategy had been set up. I would then suggest that perhaps it should go back to the Indigenous Land Corporation for a wider strategy to be submitted. But I do not think we can suggest that those in the other place, however misguided they may be, are being deliberately malicious. I think that probably goes beyond the pale. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that my colleagues would also agree that these are not amendments that warrant an epic debate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government opposes proposed amendment No. 18 because, as with amendment No. 15, we see that the proposal could make the Indigenous Land Corporation unworkable. It essentially says that, until there is a regional plan, there will not be a capacity to purchase land. That, of course, does not make a lot of sense. Those of us who know how the world works recognise that it will necessarily take some time to properly devise that regional plan. There may well be a great many reasons why the immediate purchase of key and strategic areas of land is desirable. So the government does not accept that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment No. 19 places a mandatory requirement on the Indigenous Land Corporation to consult with state and local governments. The shadow minister made the point that, in the state of New South Wales, we could have the New South Wales land fund, the Indigenous Land Corporation and ATSIC all purchasing land. There needs to be coordination; that is quite right. But this amendment says nothing about that. It really focuses on the question of state and local governments, neither of which are in a position to bring about that coordination that is so necessary. It is no doubt for that reason that the government has always supported the view that ATSIC should be represented on the board of the fund to bring about the greatest degree of coordination and, consequently, accountability with respect to the management of the fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I have to tell those opposite that the government and indigenous people see right through the coalition with respect to this particular amendment. Can we seriously imagine what Aboriginal people will say if the federal government passes this pre-eminent social justice law and, in doing so, imposes a mandatory requirement to consult with the Court government in Western Australia or a mandatory requirement, as those opposite are suggesting, to consult with a range of local authorities in some parts of this country which have a notorious anti-Aboriginal hostility? If those opposite do not believe what I am saying, they should consult with Aboriginal people and they will be told how badly some sections of local government have let them down. That is not to say that many areas of local government in this country do not have a great and commendably improving relationship with indigenous people; they do, and that is one of the key focuses of the process of reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that there ought not to be a mandatory requirement to consult. But there ought to be encouragement to do so and there ought to be a capacity to do so. That is why we have included clauses 191N(3) and 191P(5) in the bill&mdash;to allow the corporation to consult with state and local governments. For those comprehensive and very considered reasons, the government does not support this requirement. I am not aware of any Aboriginal organisation or any Aboriginal person in the country who would advocate that compulsory requirement to consult with state and local governments. We therefore reject the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to amendment (19), the bill restricts consultations in the preparation of regional land strategies to ATSIC, regional councils and others of similar hue that the board considers appropriate, no doubt. Our amendment makes it compulsory that there be consultations with the state, territory and local governments or governments within the region&mdash;just consultations. That does not mean that you have to do everything they want, but it does mean that you get a coordinated set of arrangements.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say, quite in opposition to what the minister has just said, that it is outrageous to contemplate a major land strategy in a region without it being an absolute prerequisite to consult with the state, territory or local governments which have, after all, day-to-day management of land as their responsibility. I would have thought that if government members had a genuine desire to look at any of these amendments, rather than simply being told by their leader not to look at any of them at all, they would understand that it is vital to avoid waste and duplication and to therefore ensure that the limited resources of the Commonwealth, working in cooperation with other levels of government, are directed to the maximum benefit of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.

<PARA>These amendments are consequential amendments&mdash;consequent on amendment No. 1, which we introduced as our first amendment&mdash;which have been circulated in my name. Other comments have been made by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) since we put forward amendment No. 1. It remains a matter of curiosity to me how the minister could have argued so absolutely determinately that amendment No. 1 was subversive, intended to widen the flexibility of the Indigenous Land Corporation. That is what we were trying to do in amendment No. 1&mdash;to allow the corporation to buy land not only for corporations but also for Aboriginal trusts, for Aboriginal persons and for Aboriginal families. That was what amendment No. 1 sought to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that at one stage in a radio interview the minister considered these amendments subversive. The language he used when he talked about this amendment certainly would suggest that trying to widen the flexibility of the Indigenous Land Corporation went to the heart of the Aboriginal community. At absolutely no time did these amendments require the Indigenous Land Corporation to consider trusts or persons; they simply gave the Indigenous Land Corporation the flexibility to do so. Yet the minister said this is totally and utterly acceptable. However, the minister rejected later amendments simply because they constrained the flexibility of the ILC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister, you cannot have it both ways. You cannot object to one amendment because it widens the flexibility of the ILC and object to another amendment because it constricts the flexibility of the ILC. You must have it one way or the other. The absolute vituperativeness with which you spoke of these amendments earlier on indicates your whole attitude to this debate&mdash;that is, to raise as much division and diversion as possible on what is a very innocent amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a consequential amendment on the first amendment the coalition moved. That amendment has been exhaustively debated. I do not intend in the course of my remarks to do any more than respond to the shadow minister. I think my colleagues also wish me to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the coalition talked about the amendment that it sought government support for, it neglected to say what the nature of the amendment was that it was seeking to introduce into this bill. I place on the public record the fact that since the national parliament started to make laws with respect to Aboriginal affairs&mdash;it gained that power in 1967; it was not actively taken up until the time of the Whitlam government and it continued through the period of the Whitlam government, the Fraser government, the Hawke government and the Keating government through the whole operation of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission&mdash;the consistent cross-party position has been that grants of money would not be handed over to individual Aboriginal people to buy land. That has been a consistent hallmark of Commonwealth policy for in excess of 20 years. That has always been the policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did we find? At five minutes to midnight, when we were well into the debate on this legislation in the House of Representatives, the shadow minister pulled out an amendment from her back pocket which sought to overturn over 20 years of cross-party supported policy in Aboriginal affairs. Then she says to the government in mock horror and indignation, `You reject our amendments. You do not want cross-party support.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She not only did not consult with the government before the amendments were brought in but also did not consult with one Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person in this country. In the course of the debate today on one of the amendments, a transcript of a radio interview yesterday was dragged up involving one Aboriginal person on one regional council. There are 35 ATSIC regional councils in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it any wonder that the government is not prepared to support this amendment? It is poor public policy. It is not just the government that is not prepared to accept the amendment. If those opposite talk to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people around the country they will find that they do not want this amendment either. They do not want the amendment because it not only lowers the public accountability of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs to the Australian parliament and the people of Australia but also lowers the public accountability of Aboriginal policy to indigenous people themselves. This amendment is not supported by either indigenous people or the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I challenge the shadow minister to go on talkback radio programs like the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sattler</EMPHASIS> program in Western Australia and try to sell this policy publicly. She should go and tell people listening to those talkback programs how the coalition wants to make grants of money to individual Aboriginal people to allow this land fund to proceed in this way. It is not the government's policy. It is not the policy of Aboriginal people. It overturns 20 years of cross-party support for good public policy in this area. We absolutely reject this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have about a minute and half to contribute to the debate on this amendment. I put on record the coalition's position in regard to these consequential amendments, which deal with sections 191S, 191T and 191U. The government has to understand what the coalition is seeking to do by these amendments. The coalition is seeking to expand the range of people who can be affected by this legislation. Far from trying to narrow the effect of the legislation to corporations, we seek to include individuals and trusts to broaden the effect that the land fund will have on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past the government has seen fit to adopt a bipartisan approach with respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. I need only refer to the debate on the ATSIC bill which was introduced in the last parliament&mdash;when I was not a member of this place&mdash;to see that the government and opposition sat down and deliberately worked out amendments that would change the bill to ensure that it had bipartisan support. The government has not done that on this issue because it is trying to drive a wedge into the debate about Aboriginal affairs. It is trying to paint the picture that the coalition is against Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. It has done that with respect to the Native Title Act and now it is doing it with respect to the land fund bill. We are quite genuinely seeking to amend the bill to improve it and ensure that the government's intentions are met. </PARA>

I refer the Treasurer to yesterday's address by the Premier of Queensland entitled `Reinventing the states' in which he forecast the de facto disappearance of the states by the turn of the century unless federal-state relations were overhauled. Does the Treasurer agree with Mr Goss that the last serious attempt to do something effective about federal-state financial relations was three years ago? Was the 1991 initiative of the then Prime Minister not torpedoed by the current Prime Minister in the course of his drive to become Labor Party leader?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I point out that some of the debate that has taken place between the states and the Commonwealth through the COAG process, particularly that which occurred at the meeting held at Hobart in February last year, has led to some significant changes in the Australian gas industry. For too long in this country gas was locked up in individual states and the movement of gas, particularly that of natural gas, between states was restricted. We have now seen the real benefits of the COAG process in the gas reforms that it is bringing forward.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This project will create 1,000 jobs at the height of the construction phase, a $35 million investment by the Cooper Basin producers at Moomba and a $50 to $100 million expansion of the petrochemical industry in New South Wales.

Certainly we are higher taxed than most of the east Asians but not all of them. Japan is slightly higher taxed than us.

In that respect, we have been conscious of the business tax regimes operating in Asian countries and we have moved to provide some comparability with various recent moves related to accelerated depreciation and investment allowances and the cut in the company tax rate from 39c to 33c in the dollar. With that we have made Australia reasonably competitive.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Fowler for his continuing interest in the ABC. Members would be aware that the Australia Television satellite television service was launched by the ABC in February 1993. This service is, in my opinion, an important activity for the ABC and it is making a valuable contribution to promoting Australia in the region. The service's ability to achieve a balance between cultural sensitivity and editorial independence has been well received in the region, particularly in the area of news and current affairs. It is the government's view that the involvement of the ABC in Australia Television has been supported by the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year I became aware of some expressions of concern about the financial viability of the Australia Television service and the level of separation between the activities of Australia Television and the ABC's national services. I commissioned a review of the service, which focused on financial and management aspects, and the review was conducted by senior officers from my department and the Department of Finance with the cooperation of senior officers from the ABC. After I received the review's report last week, I forwarded it to the ABC board for its comment, and last night I received the board's response. The key findings of the review are that, while the service costs twice as much as originally estimated, it has been successfully established and it is making a contribution to Australia's objectives in the South-East Asian region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date, the financial support of the service by the ABC has not involved the diversion of resources from budget funded activities and there is no evidence of adverse effects on the ABC's core activities because of the operation of Australia Television. However, these findings are dependent on the service's ability to repay to the ABC an internal line of credit with interest, and that has been extended to Australia Television over the last two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review has also raised some issues of financial accountability, which is of relevance to all of the ABC's commercial enterprises.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A coalition government would retain the ABC but it would have to generate more income from the private sector.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This week the current shadow minister for communications and the arts, Senator Alston, has been criticising the ABC's involvement in pay television. Yesterday he said, `The ABC is increasingly making money from the private sector, as we know, but all that does is encourage it to get off and get into highly speculative commercial ventures such as pay television.' That was the view of Senator Alston yesterday. On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program, on pay TV, he said:</PARA>

I hope that honourable members are aware that some $15.3 million has been allocated under the rural incentives program&mdash;a very important program to ensure that general practitioners relocate to country areas where there are substantial shortages of GPs, unlike the cities where we have an excess. We have succeeded in relocating some 78 GPs, with a further 55 in prospect. That means that a lot of small country communities will again have their general practitioner, supported by the government, to ensure a high quality of primary care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, I noticed that a recent press release of Senator Sandy Macdonald stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Training in rural health must be accelerated with more medical students attracted from country areas willing to return to work in the bush and to provide more facilities to support rural medical practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA>I am delighted to tell Senator Macdonald that in fact that is already occurring. In this year's budget funding was provided to ensure that the medical schools around this country have a proper rural health curriculum. I have recently approved significant funding under the $1.7 million available this year to ensure that they not only include proper training for rural health but also have placements for students in training in country general practice so that more general practitioners are familiar with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One element of Senator Macdonald's proposal was that we should send some of our country students back to the bush. They are the ones in fact more likely to go and practise in the bush&mdash;not only nurses but doctors, too. I am pleased that the medical schools themselves have indicated their desire to see more country students selected&mdash;a form of affirmative action, I might say, for country students&mdash;to ensure that we get a better balance between country and city practitioners. It is one of the few occasions, including the membership of the shadow cabinet, where the National Party appears to support affirmative action, but in this case I agree with the medical schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short term, I would like to draw the attention of members to another very important set of programs. We are all aware of the fact that during drought and difficult times such as these we have higher rates of suicide, marital breakdown and mental health problems in the rural community. Again, I am delighted that the shadow spokesperson indicated we should put money into counselling for people in these drought affected areas. I am pleased to inform the member that we are doing that. Already some 18,000 clients have been through the program providing counselling since 1986. This year there are 5,000 people&mdash;a sad number&mdash;currently involved in a counselling program worth some $3.5 million in the current budget. In addition, in the current budget we have provided some $2.7 million, and 24 projects are being undertaken around Australia, particularly to address mental health issues.</PARA>

That is the issue that was raised yesterday. The obvious answer to the question I am now asked is that it has nothing at all to do with the election funding return legislation because payment of debts outside election debts need not be revealed under that legislation. However, the real question asked yesterday was whether people who have donated money for the purposes of election campaigns should reveal that fact.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I can inform the House that I will be introducing legislation next month to make the child support scheme more flexible. The legislation will allow all regular payers to pay privately. That will speed the system up. It will allow stage one parents who become unemployed to skip the court process and change their payments by simple agency notification. It will also allow for simpler proof of parentage requirements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The big improvement for the Child Support Agency will be in the area of phone contact. Most child support offices have already installed new telephone technology, which has dramatically reduced delays. I can inform the House that all offices will be equipped with this new technology by the end of January. By that time we will have a voice messaging system up and running. This will allow parents to ring up 24 hours a day and get details of payments and arrears.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exciting news is that we are working on a vastly superior phone service&mdash;an auto-bank service for child support clients which will be known as the Child Support Infobank. This package is already in use in Massachusetts, and 60 per cent of calls there are answered electronically. In addition to the benefits of the voice messaging system where details of payments can be obtained, the infobank will also give information on things like arrears, the review processes, how to contact the local representative on the registrars advisory panel, the law and the operation of the child support act. People can receive a hard copy of that information by pressing the star button. If they want to go through to an operator they can just press the hash button.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am told that this service has been enormously popular in Massachusetts. Like electronic banking, people have learnt to use it fairly quickly. Evidence shows that the clients in Massachusetts are attracted by the privacy that the child support infobank offers. It has greatly improved its client service and it has freed up staff for the difficult cases. Best of all, it is not all that expensive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to world's best practice, I can tell the honourable member that in many areas we are the model for the world's best practice. With collection rates at around 70 per cent we are amongst the best in the world. By comparison the United States, which has had a service operating for about 20 years, has a collection rate of about 19 per cent. Over the next few years, we will also be employing another 150 staff to assist with the collection of arrears because we know that we can do much better.</PARA>

When the proposed new electoral boundaries for Victoria were released by the Australian Electoral Commission in August, members of parliament and electors generally were given an opportunity to object and to submit amendments to the redistribution, as provided in the act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One honourable member from this side of House made such an objection, and proposed new boundaries. As I understand it, he was told that his objections could only be considered today, 20 September, a parliamentary sitting day.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process adopted by the AEC appears to be one of blatant disregard to the primary obligation of members to attend the parliament when it is sitting. I submit that, if the AEC has insisted that the honourable member should attend during this sitting week instead of hearing his objections last week, next week or Friday of this week, which is not a sitting day, it has forced to him to absent himself from a parliamentary sitting and, therefore, he is in breach of the privileges of the House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This drought is now a major national problem which demands a proper national response in the national economic interest. The whole tragic scenario has been far worse than it needed to have been and should be because of a lack of appropriate government policy in the years prior to the drought and in the years building up to the drought and because of a belated reaction when the inevitable happened and we hit a biggie&mdash;a severe drought. </PARA>

The Prime Minister, having done a 180 degree turn, now acknowledges that this is a national problem blighting one of the major sectors of the national economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I digress. The point I wanted to make is that, largely because of the sort of environment the government has given them to operate in, farmers went into this horrendous circumstance financially stricken. As we sit here today, our farm sector owes $17.3 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are five major areas of culpability on this government's part. Firstly, it ran for years a high inflation economy. Farmers who export most of their product&mdash;and have to compete on international markets, where they cannot pass on the increased costs of production&mdash;found that their costs were rising by anything from 10 per cent to 14 per cent every year throughout the 1980s. That undergirded a major collapse in their terms of trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, we had interest rates way above those levels that our competitors enjoyed, if that is the word. For one stretch, farmers paid interest in excess of 20 per cent for over 18 months. Even today, my rural counsellor friends tell me that most of the people they have on their books are paying between 14 and 15 per cent in interest. So much for the sort of salvation through lower interest rates that we hear about endlessly in this place. As the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) pointed out today, while the government is talking about what it is doing to help the farmers, it is running an economic policy that is seeing interest rates continually rise. We have just had a rise of three-quarters of one per cent. That cost the farm sector $120 million. We are told that we are going to get another one per cent increase before Christmas and that will cost the farm sector another $170 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the government is culpable because it expected farmers to cop the full costs of deregulation. It left everyone else featherbedded&mdash;insulated from the harsh realities of economic life&mdash;while it stripped away every modicum of assistance that the farm sector got. So why is it, for example, that, after all the reports throughout all those years highlighting this problem, it still costs up to three times more in this country to process a kilo of meat than it does in America, or twice what it costs in New Zealand or Argentina? They are countries we actually have to compete with in Asia. While you mob talk endlessly about how competitive we are now in Asia, you refuse to get on in the area of reforms which will actually make us competitive. </PARA>

If you wanted to do away with indirect tax burdens, you could find well over $1 billion as well that none of our farm competitors abroad face.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, you are culpable because you gutted IEDs&mdash;the prudent farmers' drought insurance&mdash;just when they were most needed. Farmers could have put away hundreds of millions in those couple of years when they did have a bit of cash in the late 1980s and there were a few profits about. But, no, the government wanted the tax. I put it to you in very simple terms that that decision was made at a cost not just to the farmers involved but to the nation as well. It was a short-sighted policy not just for farmers but for the national economy as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifthly, the government, having stripped away the mechanisms that were in place for coping with severe drought in this country, despite constant warnings that a different approach would be needed for severe drought as opposed to the normal dry spells we get in this country, did not heed those warnings. The inevitable happened: we ran into another severe drought and the government was caught with nothing in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just state the obvious: there is a difference between those regular dry spells that we get every three or four years in this country that farmers should be enabled and facilitated to prepare for and the sort of severe natural disaster type of drought that we get every 15 years or so, which has plainly now descended upon us in many areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost in human terms of this policy inadequacy from a party that says it cares about people is enormous. It is highly visible. It comes in at us virtually every night now on our TV screens. Australians have been generous. They have done what the government would not do and we applaud that generosity. Personally, I am very glad it has been there, but I believe it is a disgrace that one sector of the Australian community finds that, when hard times decimate it, it has to rely on food parcels provided by the rest of the community through its generosity. </PARA>

People have to cope not just with seeing their life's work disappear before them but also with the agonies of wondering how on earth they are going to provide for their families' basic needs. It seems to me that this has been something of an unsung story, particularly in its impact on women. Women are often the unsung heroes out there, supporting stressed out, overworked husbands while they too feel stressed out and overworked.

A social worker in Toowoomba told me a couple of years ago now&mdash;this problem has been around for quite a while; the government has just woken up to it&mdash;that often the kids see mum and dad going through hell and say to themselves, `Mum and Dad are going through this to give me a chance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not simply a welfare matter. It is a question of the national economic interest. Having made the problem so much worse by its appalling economic management, the government must now act to keep as much of this nation's farm assets intact as possible against that day when rain does come, against that day when we then expect the rural sector to get back on its feet quickly and start producing national export dollars again. The costs of not doing so will be immense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Report after report from Queensland in particular, but now increasingly from the rest of the nation, highlights the sell-off of breeding stock in this country&mdash;particularly cows in calf in Queensland&mdash;and the loss of export income both now and after the drought from the biggest rural export industry is potentially enormous. If we do not take some steps now to prevent it happening, those costs will go on for years after the drought ends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wool International&mdash;it is interesting that it seems to be more observant about what is happening in this context than the Australian government&mdash;reckons that international wool buyers are worried that wool growers will not be able to restock if they lose their flocks now. They are watching the scene and saying, `There is plenty of wool now in the stockpile, but if growers lose their flocks they are not going to be able to rebuild them because they are so financially weakened.' Wool International sees the problem, yet this mob opposite apparently cannot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government does not seem able to perceive that, without adequate measures now not only to meet the welfare needs&mdash;if you like, the relief side of the equation&mdash;but also to ensure retention of our farmers and their asset base and recovery when rains come, very expensive things will happen. We will lose more farmers and their production. We will pay out still more in re-establishment grants and subsequent welfare payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me put it to the House that, if we lose another 4,000 farmers as a result of this drought and the government's inactivity, and they all claim their re-establishment grants, the government will have to pay out well over $200 million directly in re-establishment grants and it will then have to support them on welfare. We will see more and more people lose their jobs in post farm gate activities&mdash;the feedlot industry, the abattoir industry, the food processing industry. I remind you that the biggest sector of the manufacturing industry in this country is the food processing sector. Above all, we will lose much needed export income, in very large slabs, on an ongoing basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have consistently tried to highlight the critical importance of preserving breeding flocks and herds. In a severe drought, feed grain becomes the major fodder reserve. We have seen prices rise from $100 at silo to around $200 now. It is cold comfort for graziers to know that they are now getting close to as high as they will go because they are hitting the cap of international grain prices. Just as it did in 1982, lack of supply is driving the price. It happened in 1982 before the subsidy was introduced; it has happened again this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that graziers, not knowing how long this will continue and faced with their own huge financial problems, are right now making the decision to let their stock go or, worse, simply die. The Commonwealth should stop ducking this very important national issue and address it squarely. This country cannot afford a wholesale reduction in such an important asset as its breeding flocks and herds. Therefore, the test against which tomorrow's package must be evaluated is whether it properly meets the three Rs&mdash;relief, retention and recovery. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what the Deputy Leader of the National Party put up last week. The government's national drought policy was introduced in July 1992. It followed a unanimous decision reached by all state and federal ministers. There was no dissent.

Your policy wants us to go backwards. You want us to bring in elements that all the state and territory governments unanimously agreed were totally inappropriate for the long-term sustainability of the Australian farming system.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just look at the situation the opposition is playing around with while we are facing this issue seriously. Parts of Queensland and northern New South Wales have been in drought for some four years. The drought in a number of areas is amongst the worst on record. Unfortunately, the outlook is for little improvement. Australia could be in drought until April 1995 at the earliest and drought could persist into the spring of 1995 in northern Australia. Let us hope that these predictions are wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Drought will reduce the net value of farm production by $1.3 billion and the value of farm exports by some $450 million in 1994-95. Australia's winter crop is forecast to fall by 40 per cent to around 17 million tonnes this year. For the nation at large, economic growth is likely to reduce by five percentage points in 1994 as a direct result of the drought. Yet all the opposition wants to do is try to score some cheap political points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition knows that the cabinet has drought on its agenda for tomorrow. The opposition has tried to get up with this weak MPI.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition also tries to argue that we delayed a response to the drought. I take this opportunity to debunk this myth. Since September 1992 the Commonwealth has allocated $47.2 million in direct drought assistance through the rural adjustment scheme. The government has also agreed to match, on a dollar for dollar basis, the `Farmhand' public drought appeal brought forward by Channel 9. At present, the `Farmhand' appeal, through the Nine Network, has raised $4 1/2 million and the estimates are that, with the Commonwealth matching commitment, the total could amount to $10 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The states have also provided significant drought support. Since 1991 the Queensland and New South Wales governments have provided over $60 million for drought relief. Last August the Commonwealth provided an extra $14 million package. It included an extra $2 1/2 million in exceptional circumstances support under RAS to Queensland. This was in addition to the $4.5 million for drought assistance under RAS for Queensland in the last budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package also contained an extra $5 million exceptional circumstances support to New South Wales as well as the extension of the Task project in Queensland and into New South Wales. There was also some $1.39 million to increase financial and family counselling and communicate financial assistance measures available for drought. We have also announced relaxation of guidelines for eligibility under the assistance for isolated children's scheme. Our policy approach encourages primary producers to adopt self-reliant approaches in managing risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what has been done to date and cabinet, of course, will go much further tomorrow. We have never sat back and said that it was a one-off effort. We always review our policies to make sure that they keep on hitting the mark. A special task force has been established in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, and a Commonwealth interdepartmental committee has been convened to consider the adequacy of Commonwealth programs. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) and the department have consulted widely with key groups, including the National Farmers Federation, rural counsellors, private charity groups and the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council. Continuing talks have also taken place with affected states. A special meeting of the Agricultural and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand has been called for Friday to discuss the drought issues&mdash;in other words, all state and Commonwealth ministers will meet this Friday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins has also undertaken to review the RAS exceptional circumstances guidelines, and the advisory council has been asked to provide the minister with advice on possible changes to RAS to address perceived problems. In the past&mdash;in the opposition's time&mdash;drought assistance measures provided by the state and territory governments varied significantly but generally took the form of concessional loans for carry-on purposes or for very specific purposes, such as financial aid for eligible activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the signing of the national drought policy statement in 1992, the states and territories have moved towards implementing its range of measures&mdash;measures based on the principles of sustainable development, risk management, productivity growth and structural adjustment in the farm sector. This has generally involved the phasing out of transaction based subsidies that may have been provided during periods of drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, these things are way beyond the comprehension of the National Party, which is only on about rhetoric and trying to look good and present an image of caring.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has never run away from recognising the seriousness of the position facing our farm sector. In New South Wales, average farm cash income for broadacre farms is expected to fall, unfortunately, by around 50 per cent in 1994-95 to $19,500 per farm. It is a great tragedy that some 26 per cent of farms are expected to have negative farm cash income in the financial year 1994-95. The largest relative falls in income are expected in the wheat and other crops industry, where average farm cash income is expected to fall from $161,700 in 1993-94 to around minus $8,300 in 1994-95. Many of these farms had well above average crops in 1993-94, which highlights the variability the rural sector faces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farm cash incomes in the livestock industries in New South Wales are expected to remain relatively unchanged in 1994-95. In the sheep industry, higher prices for wool are likely to offset slightly lower production and increased fodder costs, but the level of income is forecast to continue to remain at depressed levels. In the beef industry, forced slaughterings are expected to maintain incomes in the short run. However, the cost of restocking properties is likely to reduce incomes in later years. Average farm cash income for broadacre farms in Queensland in 1994-95 is expected to fall by around 15 per cent to $33,200. Unfortunately, some 38 per cent of farms in Queensland are expected to suffer negative farm cash income in 1994-95. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a cartoon in last week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. Perhaps it is inappropriate to make jest of what we are talking about. It shows this wonderful cartoon of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on the wonderful trip he made last week talking to a farmer. The farmer is saying, `The rain seems to have missed us again,' and just to the right we see this big black cloud and money bucketing down on the maritime unions. In between, in the citadel, we see a remote little Parliament House in the picture. If ever there was a way of describing to the Australian people what this government's attitude is to agriculture and to farmers, that cartoon says it all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal quickly with the fodder subsidy. ABARE estimates that fodder prices rose by only 15 per cent while the subsidy was in place in 1982-83. But that is only half the equation. The other thing to remember is that fodder prices rise substantially during drought anyway. It was happening in 1982-83 when the subsidy was introduced and it is happening now. In fact, feed grain prices have doubled from about $100 a tonne at the start of the year to $200 a tonne now. That is the problem with the government. It does not even understand the fundamentals of a market. If there is a shortage of supply, the price goes up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) talks about the benefits going to the freight forwarders and to the fodder suppliers. It is a bit like saying, `If you provide DSS or CES benefits, then the benefits are going to the office of the CES or the DSS.' That is what you are saying. Because people are actually employed in the social welfare industry, they will receive the benefit. That is the nonsense of it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember 1988 very well. I was a farmer on the Eyre Peninsula and Walsh pulled drought out of the natural disaster relief arrangements. What had the government done just five years before? It had abolished IEDs. The then opposition offered sensible amendments which would have overcome any difficulties. What did this government do? It threw the baby out with the bath water. There were no IEDs in 1983. We went through the high interest rates, we struck the crash in commodity prices and then, in 1988, the government pulled the rug on NDRA. That is the way Walsh does it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly the Labor Party. Let us talk a little about drought. We now have an urban dominant culture in this country. But at least on this side of the House we have people who have had some experience with self-employment and agriculture. Many of us have experienced the effects of drought. There is a lot of nonsense talked about subsidies. I do not know a farmer who, if he had a choice, would not take a better price or a profit. He would always take that ahead of a subsidy. He will never look for a subsidy while he can get a decent margin out of what he is trying to do. The government loves to do it this way. It loves to get farmers to their knees, because it does not understand them, and offer two bob at the end of the day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at agriculture. This government is very good at telling us how good it is at diversifying this economy and that we no longer depend on agriculture; agriculture is not much value to the economy any more; we have all this value adding and all these wonderful things that we do. But it is estimated that about 30 per cent of the Australian work force depends on the agricultural industry from paddock to plate. It is estimated that, for every person employed in agricultural production, 5.7 people are employed in the economy. Thus 1.95 million people are employed in the total industry, from farming to retailing. Yet here we are saying that agriculture is not of much account, not much value to the country, and tomorrow we are going to talk about a $100 million package, which, as the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) said, will be wiped out by a $170 million interest rate rise. Just one interest rate rise doubles the effect of any benefit that a government package might bring. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let us not look too narrowly. Let us look at the wider political implications. This government talks about regional development. It offers $150 million over four years, but it will take $2 billion by way of extra excise in 1995-96. That is the government's equation: it gives two bob and takes $2. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know how long it will be before regional Australia wakes up to this. I think many of them are waking up to it. But, for the 35 per cent who rely on agriculture for employment, the people who are employed in small businesses in every town in this country, except, fortunately, in Western Australia, this drought is spreading right across the nation. The people who are employed, the small businesses, the machinery dealers, all those people who make up the infrastructure of a town, have been damaged by 10 to 12 years of neglect by Labor governments. We accept that drought is a phenomenon of our cycle in this country. We do not accept that it is to be run alongside all these imposts, all these burdens and all these crocodile tears that we see from the government at times like this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From the very outset let me say that the federal Labor Party is vitally concerned with the rural sector and the difficulties that it is presently facing. Over recent years, the rural sector has experienced a great deal of hardship. Successive years of weak commodity prices, world recession and declining terms of trade have resulted in low incomes for many. Farmers have responded to these financial pressures by increasing on-farm productivity and/or reducing expenditure. However, for many farmers, the capacity for adjustment and productivity is stretched. This has been exacerbated by the present widespread drought. The federal Labor Party has had policies to address those problems in the past. It presently has, and will in the future have, policies regarding drought, including the package that will be presented tomorrow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the opposition, particularly the National Party, which at the present time is absolutely discredited in a policy sense, to come in here and carry on in its hypocritical way&mdash;the same way that it has done for years&mdash;shows an enormous amount of gall and hide. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) has recently been criticised for going to various meetings&mdash;Liberal Party meetings in Western Australia, League of Rights meetings and other meetings&mdash;and simply telling people what they wanted to hear. He did not tell people what the policy was; he let them know what they wanted to hear. I do not know whether he has learnt that from the National Party, but that is what the National Party has been doing for years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Party suffers from chronic hypocrisy. It goes out to its meetings and morning teas in the bush and thinks all it has to do is say `cow', `church' and `fodder subsidy' a few times and it will get away with anything. People are starting to wake up to the hypocrisy of you lot. Nothing in that hypocrisy is more plain than the tripe in a paper put out&mdash;or leaked&mdash;a few months ago by the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott). For the benefit of the rest of the honourable members, I will tell them a bit about that paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member talks about winning the vote of influential community leaders. This concerns rural and regional development because he is the shadow spokesman. He talks about infrastructure. He says, `We need to set a figure&mdash;$1 billion, $3 billion.' He further says, `The actual number is insignificant.' In other words, go out and promise people the world; forget about having to pay for those promises because they will not be carried out. In the same paragraph regarding those promises he says, `We should then allude to some sort of assessment procedure by which regions can seek direct funding out of that $1 billion or $3 billion.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He says we must create a perception of reducing costs of businesses&mdash;for example, reduce payroll tax. He says similarly that any reduction in business regulation, most of which is state based anyway, will be well perceived. Then he goes on about community services in much the same vein as infrastructure. He says we need to make a commitment. This commitment traverses several portfolios, including health, education and telecommunications. Again, the actual dollar value is unimportant. So he says, `Let's go out there and promise the world.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is exactly what the National Party does time and time again. It has a leader, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), who is an embarrassment not only to the National Party but to the whole of the government. He goes well with the Leader of the Opposition, who is a joke in the whole of the country. No wonder they cannot come up with policies with well-constructed ideas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard the Deputy Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), talking about well-constructed policy, yet in his media release he stated that the central piece, the key element, of his policy was to support the immediate introduction of a drought relief fodder subsidy scheme to help offset the massive cost of feeding livestock. We certainly do not doubt that there is a need and a massive cost in feeding livestock, but he says support is needed for the immediate introduction of a drought relief fodder subsidy similar to that provided in the 1982-83 drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do other people have to say about it? On Wednesday, 31 August the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> reported that Gary Goucher, the National Farmers Federation director of policy, said that the opposition&mdash;and I think he understated it&mdash;was a bit out of step with the industry. I think it is one of the great understatements of the century to say it is a bit out of step. With regard to the fodder subsidy, those opposite should realise&mdash;and I am sure they do&mdash;that it sounds good when they go out and talk in the country halls and say `fodder subsidy'. They think it sounds good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fodder subsidies encourage bad managers to retain overstocking on land for much longer than the stock should be carried on the land.

The National Farmers Federation policy director, Gary Goucher, said that the centrepiece of the coalition's policy, a subsidy for fodder, was riddled with problems. He said there was a range of unexplained areas. How do you get over that? You stand up here and say, `We know all about it,' and come up with that sort of absolute rubbish and tripe. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my view, after what I have just said about your sort of policy you would be well advised to keep your mouth shut. The programs and policies of the federal Labor Party are designed for the long term and the short term. They are programs to improve farm productivity by encouraging an efficient and technologically advanced agricultural base which is commercially and market oriented, internationally competitive and participates fully in value adding and strong linkages. Elements for the structural adjustment include the rural adjustment scheme, the farm household support scheme, the jobsearch allowance and the rural and financial counselling programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This terrible drought is hurting a lot of country people. We have the national drought policy, which involves publicity and awareness campaigns, property management planning, education and training, farm management bonds, resource management, income tax incentives and drought research and development. We are encouraging the pick-up of the technology through the rural research and development corporations with heavy government backing and commercialisation extension and demonstration support. There are landcare, water and vegetation, sustainable development and a whole range of other programs that try to address the problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we compare that with what the opposition offers, it is no wonder that the farming organisations have realised that their only hope is this government. The weak and shillyshally leadership of both the National Party and the Liberal Party can never provide an answer for them. It worries the National Party and Liberal Party when they look at the recent polls.

<PARA>I have moved these amendments together because we will not call divisions on them. Amendment No. 23 seeks to add after proposed subsection 191U(2) that `section 47 of the Native Title Act 1993 does not apply to land acquired by a body corporate, person or trust under subsection (1)'. We believe it is extremely important that Aboriginal people who acquire land have the same flexibility as others with respect to what they do with their land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment will not affect Aboriginal occupation and use of the land. The community can make the choice as to what it wants to do with the land. However, it allows greater flexibility for the community to sell or mortgage the land or use it as security. In other words, it can operate the land commercially through normal commercial practices. This offers Aboriginal communities the chance to establish an economic base as well as a social and cultural base. Amendment No. 24 seeks to omit paragraph (a) and substitute: `a Chairperson appointed by the Prime Minister'. This is in relation to the board of the ILC. Under the present bill, all members are appointed by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. Under the circumstances, we feel that there is the danger of the minister having too narrow a focus. We have widened this to have a chairperson appointed by the Prime Minister and a deputy chairperson appointed by the Minister for Finance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to address amendment No. 23, which seeks to override a key element of the agreement reached between the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), on behalf of the government, and Aboriginal people in the native title negotiations so that the Native Title Act would not apply. It seems to me that amendment No. 23 exhibits very clearly for all the world to see the true intention of the opposition's position. It is effectively saying that Aboriginal people who may purchase land under the land fund bill should, as a result of those purchases, disallow themselves from making application under the Native Title Act in relation to that land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that I find that very difficult to understand. I cannot quite understand why the opposition is so opposed to it, unless this is another way of indicating its opposition to the Native Title Act. If that is the case&mdash;I assume that it is&mdash;it clearly demonstrates that the opposition has learnt absolutely nothing about the concerns and aspirations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of this debate, the opposition has posited 37 amendments. Its support or otherwise for this bill is contingent upon the government accepting those amendments. Does it honestly believe that, given the passage of the Native Title Act, the Commonwealth would contemplate supporting a proposition which would deny Aboriginal people, who through this land fund bill would be able to purchase land, access to the Native Title Act?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, I cannot think of anything sillier in terms of where the government is coming from and where the Aboriginal community is expecting the government to arrive at. It reflects very poorly on the opposition. In conversations with my constituents, a large proportion of whom are Aboriginal people&mdash;roughly 23 or 24 per cent of the population of the Northern Territory is Aboriginal&mdash;I have not heard one Aboriginal person indicate one jot of support for these sorts of propositions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I invite the shadow spokesperson at the table, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), to indicate what ground swell of opinion amongst Aboriginal people has led them to this proposition. Why do you not just tell us truly what your agenda is? Why do you not make it clear to the Australian public that you have never had any intention of supporting this land fund? I doubt it but, given today's performance, she might have been the person who bleated to the Sydney <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> this morning that members of the opposition parties who want to support this land fund bill are being denied the opportunity to do so because of the tactics of the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is the case, it reveals two things: firstly, the tactics of the opposition have been designed wholly and solely at frustrating the passage of this legislation; and, secondly, the opposition is denying not only Aboriginal people in Australia access to the land fund bill&mdash;it has indicated its intention to oppose and frustrate it through the Senate&mdash;but also those people who have been dispossessed as a result of activities over the last 204 or 205 years to the native title legislation. I cannot see how the shadow spokesperson, who supposedly represents the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, can stand in this place and put forward those propositions. They have no substance, validity or credibility. These propositions which she has put forward have none of those attributes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is very important that speakers on the government side give some people on this side of the House some credit for having spent a considerable amount of time trying to design some responsibility into areas of the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994. Time and again, government members have got up and said to us, `This is what the Aboriginal people want and that is what the Aboriginal people want.' I can tell you that in this drought, which may be one of the greatest of all time, farmers want a lot of things too, but we know that good sense means they cannot have all of those things that they might want on any particular occasion. The government's duty is obviously to come up with a responsible bill which not only deals with the aspirations of Aborigines but also reassures a whole lot of other Australians that their rights are not going to be infringed either.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of amendment No. 23 is to separate native title from the land acquisition fund. I will just take honourable members back to what was said in the preamble of the Native Title Act and in the explanatory memorandum: the land acquisition fund was for those Aborigines who had been dispossessed of native title. For reasons I explained earlier, it is now gone. Now we are going to acquire pastoral leases with the land acquisition fund. The government member who just spoke, the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), said that Aboriginal people should not be prevented from attempting to establish that native title existed in those areas. But the whole purpose of this fund is to go into areas where native title was not able to be established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) said a fortnight ago and again here this morning, that was the purpose of this bill. That is why we tried to get that previous amendment brought into this land acquisition fund bill&mdash;which you would not have. It was a perfectly innocuous amendment. It was actually almost word for word along the lines of your intention in the Native Title Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So here we are trying to separate the two so that you do not have a situation where tenure or title that exists at the present time is confused with native title. Let me give you one very good reason for that. Perhaps the minister sitting at the table, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), can explain something when he gets up. Let us say that we get foot-and-mouth disease in this country. Can the minister tell me whether or not those areas subject to native title&mdash;with, in some cases, stringencies of access for other people&mdash;will be subject to the sorts of ingredients, terms, conditions, and instant and urgent actions that will be required to stop the progress of a disease like foot-and-mouth disease? I will tell the minister something. If he can answer that, I will be very surprised because the bureaucrats responsible for dealing with that matter in South Australia do not know the answer. I hope he can answer that in a positive sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are all sorts of problems and reservations that local councils have to deal with. They have the right to go onto people's properties and so do other institutions. As we have tried to do in several parts of the bill, we are trying to make sure that those original titles stay as they are: acquired by Aborigines under the ILC but with the title staying the same. I know that the minister does not know the answer. He has to ask his advisers but he might take some time to find out the answers to those questions because it is a very important matter for the future administration of this country&mdash;by states, by local councils and by all sorts of authorities who have responsibility for those areas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable  member  for Barker  (Mr McLachlan) is now introducing another element into this debate by talking about foot-and-mouth disease. It is a genuine concern and a genuine issue and I appreciate the fact that it is an issue that needs resolution, but let us not hide what is the real motivation behind this amendment. It has nothing to do with foot-and-mouth disease. It has nothing to do with any of the extraneous matters that the member for Barker might wish to bring into the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is all about a re-run of the native title debate which the opposition so culpably failed to participate in last time by just ruling itself out of the debate by saying that it opposed the whole bill. It excluded itself from the process. It marginalised itself from the debate about native title. It exposed the shallowness of its policy position on native title in November last year and it is trying now to have another bite at the cherry by re-entering this whole debate about native title legislation. By this amendment the opposition is attempting to defeat one of the principal clauses in the Native Title Act to make sure it cannot apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Barker in his contribution said that opposition members have tried to show some responsibility in designing amendments that they felt would make the legislation stronger and better, but the big problem opposition members have is that they have designed these amendments in total isolation. It is not a question of the government saying that we want to give everything to the Aboriginal community. Of course we know that that is not possible. Government will always have many more demands placed upon it than it can ever actually meet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has not tried to give everything that the Aboriginal community could possibly ever want through this legislation, but we have tried to negotiate with Aboriginal people about how they believe this fund should operate and what types of operations should occur. There have been meaningful, mature negotiations between two sides to come up with a package of proposals that not only reflects the government's needs and responsibilities and the processes of accountability that are required in such legislation but also meets the aspirations and needs of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That contrasts completely with the opposition's proposals and its modus operandi. It sits in its own quiet, little room and thinks up ways to sabotage this bill. That is what this amendment is all about. This is just one more plank in the opposition's attempt to sabotage the land acquisition fund and at the same time try to sabotage the native title legislation. It has nothing to do with higher, principled issues such as foot-and-mouth disease, which the honourable member for Barker knows that members on this side of the House would of course be very concerned about. Of course we would be making sure that every effort is made to ensure that we have procedures to handle that on native title land or on pastoral land or any other form of land. We have as much a sense of responsibility for the country and for pastoral activity as the opposition does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not try to hide the real motivation behind those fine objectives. We know that the opposition is seeking in this legislation to discriminate against indigenous people who obtain land through the land fund and prevent them from exercising their rights under the native title legislation. The opposition has no right to do that. It is certainly not something it has arrived at because it has tried to consult with Aboriginal people and has found that this is something they want. This is something the opposition has dreamed up in its little committee room with no consultation whatsoever, with no consideration of the true aspirations of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will not wear that. The Aboriginal communities around this country will not wear it and it is about time the opposition understood that, to arrive at good public policy, to handle Aboriginal and islander aspirations and needs, it cannot just think it up in its committee room the day before legislation is about to be presented in the House and then suggest that it has done the good deed of coming up with amendments. It actually has to go out and talk to people. It actually has to find out what they really want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I assure the opposition that Aboriginal people support the land acquisition fund as the government has structured it because the government consulted widely in structuring this legislation. It talked with Aboriginal organisations and individual Aboriginal people throughout the length and breadth of this country. They want the clauses as the government has provided, not the opposition's shoddy little amendments which are an attempt to in fact rewrite the native title legislation and deny Aboriginal people their legitimate aspirations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would just like to point out to the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) that one of the problems we are facing at the moment is the banks. Aboriginal people acquiring land have aspirations. Unfortunately, at the moment, where native title is involved the banks are refusing to lend money. So, when land is bought for Aboriginal people so they can develop that land&mdash;and I am not saying it has to be bought for that purpose, but when it is&mdash;and the land is subject to native title, the banks will not lend money. Those Aboriginal people are prevented from going through the normal means of commerce to obtain loans and mortgages from the banks to use that land in a profitable, economic way, to develop it and do all the other things that people want to do when they hold land for commercial reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is important for us to put this amendment, together with a number of the other amendments, in context. I refer to a cutting from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> dated 26 August 1994&mdash;not so long ago.

<PARA>There were no qualifications&mdash;no ifs, no buts. It was a very firm, clear and unambiguous statement by the Leader of the Opposition. This item, credited to Lisa McLean, is also interesting because the last paragraph refers to the shadow minister and states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ms Gallus is a supporter in principle of the land acquisition fund and told <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Australian</EMPHASIS> on the day after she was appointed Aboriginal spokeswoman that she would support the Government's fund.</PARA>
<PARA>We are going to test that. We will see whether in fact you support the government fund. You cannot claim that you are going to and then vote against it. You cannot claim that you are going to support it and then attempt to sabotage it. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) has admirably indicated in this debate the way in which you have attempted to do just that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) made some quite reasonable observations, and I acknowledge them. He said, in effect, that we, the government, should give some credit to the opposition for the effort it put into building changes into this bill. That is a perfectly reasonable proposition, but I suggest to the honourable member for Barker that in order to obtain credit you have to earn it. We have all of these amendments that those opposite have proposed to this legislation, some of which they have acknowledged in the course of the debate are essentially peripheral and unimportant. But apparently they went through the whole of the bill and looked for every opportunity that they could find to build amendments into it. I gave reasons earlier today why they sought to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Barker also said that the government says that this is what the Aboriginal people want. Yes, we do. We say that because we asked them and we talked to them. You know that your shadow spokeswoman for Aboriginal affairs indicated that she does not do that. She indicated today that she got a comment from the Aboriginal community from television last night. It is all right for the shadow minister to sit at the desk, huff and puff and show exasperation, but that is what she said. She also said, according to Lisa McLean&mdash;and I repeat it&mdash;on the day after she was appointed Aboriginal spokeswoman that she would support the land fund. We will see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Moreton drew attention to the fact that in connection with the Native Title Bill those opposite made themselves irrelevant. They marginalised themselves. For goodness sake, they left it to the minor parties and the Independents in the Senate to make the running as far as these issues were concerned. Now, through the back door, they are attempting to achieve in this particular legislation what they were not able to achieve and what they did not seek to achieve with the native title legislation. </PARA>

No doubt one of the most significant amendments moved by the coalition is amendment No. 23&mdash;despite the fact that all the amendments moved by the coalition make very slight changes, as described by the shadow minister in the last week. The member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) is quite right in saying that the time to be counted is fast approaching. I would hope that before the hour is out we can see where the coalition stands with respect to the land fund bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment 23 seeks to override a key element of the agreement reached between the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), on behalf of the government, in his and the government's negotiations with indigenous representatives over the Native Title Act. I remind the House that section 47 of the Native Title Act is designed to allow Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders who are also owners of a pastoral lease over the same land to claim native title, notwithstanding that the grant of the pastoral lease would ordinarily have extinguished native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 47(3) of the act importantly goes on to make it clear that the effect of a native title determination is essentially&mdash;and I emphasise this point&mdash;that the pastoral lease will continue to apply to the land, including any covenants in the lease regarding the use of the land. This means, in very clear and precise terms, that the land will remain subject to the pastoral lease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, in part, answers the issue earlier raised by the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan). But I do particularly refer him and the South Australian government to section 8 of the Native Title Act, which says:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to the matter before the House, other amendments are also the subject of debate at this particular point of time. They relate to amendments 24, 25 and 26. The coalition is proposing here that the Prime Minister or the Minister for Finance appoint positions in respect of the operation of the Indigenous Land Corporation. Somehow or other, we are expected to believe that this is an amendment of substance, of principle and one that will promote good legislation. The change is to say that, instead of the appointments being made by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, some will be made by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I want to return to amendment No. 23 and make some concluding remarks in respect of that amendment. I want to emphasise to the House that what we are seeing here is undoubtedly the first salvo of the attempt by the coalition to attack the Native Title Act in practice and in this parliament. It is the first step of the on the record commitment of the federal coalition to attack what is the most important human rights legislation enacted by this parliament pursuant to the 1967 referendum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The clause it seeks to attack is not some peripheral clause. It is an essential element of the agreement, the negotiated outcome, that occurred not only with indigenous people but also with other major industry participants in this country, in particular the National Farmers Federation. While the coalition was marginalised, out on the fringe, isolated and alone, it was the government which was dealing with the main players, talking to the pastoral industry and getting this very significant negotiated outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the coalition to have a look around the world and just see what comparable conservative parties are doing in their negotiations with indigenous people. I tell members of the opposition without hesitation that they are out of step with their comparable conservative parties around the world. In Canada the</PARA>
<PARA>former conservative government of Mr Mulroney was taking the leadership to negotiate with peak representatives of indigenous people on the issues of constitutional reform. Their representatives were sitting at the negotiating table with provincial governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the United States of America, going back not only to the time of Ronald Reagan but indeed to the period of Richard Nixon, it has been people on the conservative side of United States politics who have been recognising the rights of self-determination of indigenous people. It is not some pinko plot. This is mainstream conservative politics in the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In New Zealand the government of Mr Bolger, a conservative government, is seeking to negotiate a settlement of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840. In the United States of America President Clinton earlier this year, on 29 April, issued a major executive order reaffirming his commitment to some of those principles that his opponents on the other side of politics had supported but indeed taking it further into a modern day dimension of respecting the rights of indigenous people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is in this country that when the history books are written not only will they and future generations applaud the Native Title Act but they will also applaud the processes that reached that just outcome. I believe those negotiations and that process that led to the final legislation is in many respects as important as the final outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After all that, and despite what is happening in the rest of the world, what is the coalition's position? The coalition's position is, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) has put on the public record before, a commitment to repeal the act. If he moves away from that to become moderate, he leaves a hanging threat to repeal the Native Title Act because not once has he ruled out the threat to repeal that legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the coalition's Aboriginal affairs policy is up for review the most important element of that policy, the Native Title Act, will be excluded from the review. When the shadow minister comes in here and purports to express coalition policy with respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, the rest of us in this parliament and in the wider Australian community can be forgiven for thinking that the people who really call the shots in the coalition are the leader himself, the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and those whom I would describe as the hard men of the Liberal Party frontbench. In describing the hard men of the coalition cabinet I exclude the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), who by her own actions has somewhat marginalised herself in wielding influence in the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is that we are seeing a hardline anti-Aboriginal policy being manifested in amendment 23. It seeks to gut a key element of the Native Title Act. The government will not accept the amendment. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>The bill definitely mentions business or financial management, but the bill has been worded so that it can be one or the other.

There is no requirement in the bill for anybody on the board to have financial and business management. The honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd) is shaking his head.

<PARA>These four amendments combine to change the bill. The bill currently divides the $45 million that comes out of the ILC&mdash;$21 million for ATSIC and $24 million for the ILC. Our proposed amendments to these clauses seek to have all the money going immediately to the ILC. As such, there would be only one land fund&mdash;not two. As the minister has indicated that he is extremely anxious to get this bill through before 6 o'clock, I will limit my comments to the substance of the amendments. However, should the minister want to debate the amendment, I will return to my feet. </PARA>

The opposition passed the land fund bill at that stage.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister at the table could not explain in any way why he was rejecting what were basically sensible, appropriate and necessary amendments to this bill. Worse still, at no time would the minister sit down with the opposition, discuss the amendments with us and say, `These are the reasons we do not like this amendment and that amendment.' There is no doubt that there were amendments to this bill that the minister could not find objection with, yet he would not even sit down and discuss them with the opposition. Therefore, it is with deep regret that the opposition will have to vote against this bill at the third reading stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has made and is seeking to make a great deal of this. I again refer the minister to the Prime Minister's second reading speech in which he said that the test of the opposition's reaction to this bill would be at the second reading stage. We supported the bill there and all we have asked the government to do is look seriously at our amendments in order to have the bill passed at the third reading stage. The government has deliberately rejected any discussion of those amendments and, as I said before, it is with great regret, as a consequence of the government's action, that the opposition must now vote against this bill at the third reading stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;In view of the fact that the shadow minister has made some remarks that deserve a response, I propose to speak very briefly at this time. I think it is important to place on the public record the government's commitment throughout the whole of this process to try to achieve the unanimous support of the Australian parliament for the establishment of the land fund. That public commitment on the part of the government goes right back to the time when the member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) was the Leader of the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) wrote to him many months ago seeking the coalition's views on the land fund. There was no response to that letter. The Prime Minister then introduced the legislation into the parliament over two months ago and sought coalition support for that legislation. Further to that, he wrote to the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) seeking his constructive comments to the legislation. No response was received to that letter from the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is again important to place on the public record that the government's legislation comes to this House only after the most exhaustive process of public consultation, involving in the end key representatives of indigenous people and a negotiated outcome that I think makes very important gains for indigenous people while balancing the advance in human rights with very significant principles of public accountability. After all that, the government then moved to debate the legislation in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate began but there were no coalition amendments. The debate proceeded and still there were no coalition amendments. Throughout the course of that day I was given a number of documents, some of them stamped `confidential', being drafts of the coalition amendments. Those were the documents that I worked on and which the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission advised me on and, ultimately, I advised the Prime Minister what the government's response to the legislation should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I took the view that, ultimately, what was important was to get legislation through the parliament. It was very important, if we could, to get unanimous parliamentary support. But what I was not prepared to support and what the Prime Minister and the government was not prepared to support were amendments that were going to cause great concern to Aboriginal people and that were going to be strongly opposed by them. It came to my attention that before the coalition introduced the amendments into the parliament not one single Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person in this entire country was consulted about the content of those amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not one single Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person was consulted before those amendments were introduced in the parliament. The shadow minister confirmed that in a public interview. I am used to the member for O'Connor interjecting on the opposition side. It is a bit difficult when he is on the government side, even though it will be for a fleeting period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that not one indigenous person was consulted prior to those amendments being introduced into the parliament. When I took the responsibility of trying to at least give some basic information about the coalition amendments to indigenous people, the response to those proposed amendments was an overwhelming rejection the length and breadth of this country. What an irony it is and what a reflection it is on the competence of the entire opposition that the government is left to consult indigenous people about the opposition's amendments, but that is what happened. That is what the history books will show. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is that the government wants legislation through the parliament. We always knew that the legislation would be opposed by the coalition. Not only have those opposite put forward amendments in the House of Representatives; they have further amendments to put forward in the Senate and they have a threat of a Senate inquiry. Their position of opposition has been consistent over many months. It has been led by the Leader of the Opposition, and supported by the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) and many others. It has been a consistent position of opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on an extraordinary scandal involving the Goss Labor government in Queensland and its administration, including the CJC. It came to national prominence in the Senate on 31 August 1994 following the tabling of the unanimous all-party report by the Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing which called on the Goss government to establish an independent review into unresolved whistleblower cases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case I am referring to is known as the Kevin Lindeberg case. It centres around the shredding of public records commonly known as the Heiner inquiry documents and tapes by order of the Goss cabinet on 5 March 1990 in order to reduce the risk of legal action. The Brisbane <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> on 3 September this year called it the great shredding affair. I took the trouble to obtain Mr Lindeberg's submissions to the Senate whistleblowing committee and also followed very closely the events on the floor of the Queensland's parliament some weeks ago when this affair flared up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts show that the cabinet deliberately misled the state archivist by letter dated 23 February 1990 in order to obtain her approval to destroy evidence required for litigation and then it wilfully ordered the destruction on 5 March 1990 in order to escape court action. The facts show that the Crown had been served with due and proper notification of a commencement of court proceedings by a firm of solicitors on 15 February 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts show that Queensland minister Anne Warner even admitted publicly on 8 September 1994 that she had possession of the solicitor's letter on 19 February 1990. She clearly knew what was going on. In other words, the Crown knew about the foreshadowed litigation involving the Crown itself and then secretly and wilfully set about attempting to obstruct justice by deliberately misleading the state archivist and others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have in my possession the letter to the state archivist which clearly and falsely informs the archivist that the public report&mdash;and I stress `public records'&mdash;`is no longer required or pertinent to the public records'. This was stated at the very time the government knew of the anticipated court proceedings. By law it is an offence to mislead a public official, which is what the Goss cabinet did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We even have a senior public servant with knowledge of the anticipated litigation secretly and actively destroying the evidence. That same public servant even helped prepare the cabinet's submissions on each occasion, and he would not act alone. Anyone who has the slightest knowledge of criminal law knows that the course of justice can be perverted without judicial proceedings being under way just so long as the conspirators have foreknowledge of it and seek by deception to obstruct it. Not only did the shredding obstruct justice, it utterly stopped it and was ordered by the Goss cabinet, the respondent in the proposed action. </PARA>

The facts show that the Goss government has actually confirmed possession of the solicitor's letter and stated publicly that it ordered the destruction `in order to reduce the risk of legal action'. Moreover, what makes this story so remarkable is that the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission can allegedly find no official misconduct, which raises questions of the gravest nature over its so-called independence. I seek leave to table a letter of 23 February 1990 from the Goss cabinet to the Queensland state archivist. It has already been tabled in the Queensland parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night during the adjournment debate I was commenting on the moral bankruptcy and politically corrupt activities of certain members of the Australian Labor Party. It is not surprising that my speech was constantly interrupted by members opposite because they are ashamed that very senior members of their party were involved in criminal activity. They interrupted me because the truth hurts, and they hate hearing the truth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are ashamed that during the 1980s their leaders were misappropriating funds which they were not entitled to. While the likes of Richard Court, Bill Hassell and Barry MacKinnon were calling for a royal commission, those members opposite, in particular the present Minister for Human Services and Health, the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), ignored those calls. History records that a royal commission was called and today two former Labor members of parliament, two members who held the two most senior positions in government, are in gaol. Members opposite spent last night squealing, but they did that only to prevent the truth being told. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) said that he had a thick file which asserts that a senior liberal is corrupt. I challenge him to come forward with his information. If he will not, then he should not make spurious allegations to try to deflect the fact that the Labor Party has just had a shameful decade of corruption, mismanagement and dubious dealings. As I said last night, the likes of John Curtin would be turning in their graves to think that the party to which they contributed so much had turned into an organisation for moral and political bankruptcy and corruption. </PARA>

It is important that the parents of those people who are participating in this training can be assured that the Department of Defence and the army will take all such steps as they can to avoid any repeat incidents.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LG4">Mr Lavarch</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The basis in Malaysian law for consideration of an extradition request by Australia was as follows. Malaysia recently adopted a new Extradition Act (Extradition Act l992, No. 479 of 1992). Under section 3 of that Act it was open to Malaysian authorities to consider favourably an extradition request made by Australia. Moreover, Malaysian authorities did in fact treat the extradition request by Australia as received by them and given consideration under the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Extradition requests are frequently made where there is a discretion in the Requested State whether or not to grant extradition. For example, Australia's recent extradition treaties provide a discretion with respect to the surrender of nationals of the Requested State. Nonetheless, requests are frequently made by and to Australia for the surrender of nationals, and such requests are frequently granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of Prince Raja Kamarul Bahrin Shah, Malaysia has discretion whether or not to grant extradition both because there was no treaty obligation to extradite and because the Extradition Act of Malaysia expressly preserved a discretion in the case of nationals. However countries frequently exercise a discretion to extradite even when no obligation exists to do so. Malaysia had previously granted extradition requests made by Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) I note that this part of the question is directed to assistance in relation to the children who were not, of course, the subject of the extradition request. I am advised that, under the Overseas Custody (Child Removal) Scheme, financial assistance may be provided in hardship cases to assist a parent to institute legal proceedings overseas for recovery of his or her children removed from Australia, or detained overseas, by the other parent. An applicant has to show there is a reasonable chance of securing the return of the child or children to Australia. If an applicant is unable to afford the cost of an opinion from an overseas practitioner on the likely prospects of success of proceedings in a court, assistance may be granted to enable the applicant to obtain such opinion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am further advised that as a special measure on an act of grace basis, approval was given to Mrs Gillespie's solicitors for limited funding to allow an opinion to be obtained, whilst material on hardship could be considered. Particulars of the payment made were given in my answer to Question No. 902, and there was a reasonable basis, in pursuance of the Scheme, for the payment to be made. No other funds were made available by the Commonwealth to seek the return of the children.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) In August last year, the then Minister for Health, Senator the Hon Graham Richardson, advised the LEC that funding for the National Secretariat would be reduced to bring the level of funding into line with that received by other bodies receiving satellite (Level 1) funding under the Department's Community Organisations Support Program (within which organisations are classified in terms of their consultation, information and dissemination function, and the breadth of their representation of constituents), at that time a maximum of $110 000.</PARA>
