<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">Mr SPEAKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and the 92nd Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference held in Copenhagen, Denmark from 12-17 September 1994.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, often collectively described as the Baltic States, have only recently emerged from Soviet domination. The delegation's visit was the first by a parliamentary delegation since independence was regained in 1991. The delegation was impressed by the progress made in each of the countries since then. Each has established a system of parliamentary democracy, and significant steps have been taken on the economic front and in the international arena. Nonetheless, there are significant challenges facing the Baltic States, some common to all three and some specific to the respective countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The transition to parliamentary democracy has been accompanied by the election of a multiplicity of parties to the respective parliaments. This has resulted in considerable instability in government. Indeed, while the delegation was there, Latvia was between governments and, since our return, the government in Estonia has fallen. The situation is further complicated in both these countries by the significant number of residents who are not yet enfranchised. The right to vote is of course linked to citizenship, which has been a contentious issue in each of the countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the economic sphere, there are considerable problems. Restructuring has resulted in a high level of unemployment and significant social stress. As the delegation travelled through rural areas, we were particularly struck by the obvious effects on the agricultural sector. Large tracts of excellent farming land were lying idle, as collective farming has not yet been replaced by a viable alternative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Relations with Russia dominate the foreign political relationships of each of the Baltic states. While troop withdrawal has now been achieved, the departure of those troops has left its own legacy. From the security perspective there is concern, particularly in Estonia and Latvia, that former Russian troops now resident in these countries could form a potential fifth column for the Russians in case of need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Environmentally, significant degradation has been experienced in each country as a result of the Soviet occupation. Economically, all three countries are dependent for their immediate future on trade with Russia and, in the case of Latvia and Lithuania, for their energy supplies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Substantial effort has been put into establishing productive trade links elsewhere. Considerable importance is correctly attached to inter-Baltic and Baltic-Nordic cooperation, but emphasis is also given to consolidation of relations already established with the West. All three countries aspire to membership of the European Union in the longer term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation greatly appreciated the hospitality extended by the chairs and members of the Riigikogu, the Saeima and the Seimas. The warmth of feeling between us was indicative of the links between our countries which have been fostered by Australia's Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian communities. We returned to Australia with a greater appreciation of what has been achieved since 1991. There is still a long way to go, but the commitment is there to look forward, and that is a prerequisite for a bright future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the conclusion of the bilateral visit to the Baltic states, the delegation travelled to Copenhagen for the 92nd Inter-Parliamentary Conference. The conference was well organised and, from the Australian delegation's perspective, very successful. Australian delegation members were received warmly, the Australian viewpoint was valued and, in particular, the proposal of the Australian delegation was accepted as a supplementary item for deliberation at the conference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The supplementary item proposed by Australia was the implementation of commitments agreed to in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. I was pleased to be appointed to chair a committee to draft a resolution on the item. The committee successfully achieved agreement on a resolution for presentation to the conference. This resolution, which drew heavily on that prepared by Australia in advance of the conference, was subsequently adopted by the full conference without amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The focus on Uruguay Round commitments was supplemented in the general debate by speeches from the deputy leader of the delegation, Senator Calvert, and me. Senator Calvert's speech concentrated on agriculture while I addressed the outcome for services of the Uruguay Round.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other agenda items addressed by the conference were entitled `Strengthening national structures, institutions and organisations of society which play a role in promoting and safeguarding human rights' and `International cooperation and national action to support social and economic development and efforts to combat poverty'. In this regard the other members of the delegation played a very active role in presenting views during the presentations on those items.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other meetings were held during the conference, but in particular I would like to thank the members of the delegation&mdash;Senator Calvert and Senator Woodley, the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Quick), the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) and the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay)&mdash;for their commitment to a very full program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also thank the delegation secretary, Anne Hazelton, for her professionalism, attention to detail and unfailingly cheerful assistance to us all. I would also like to thank Geraldine Skinner from my staff. I also record our appreciation of the assistance provided by ambassadors Robert Merrillees and John Burgess, the Australian embassy staff in Stockholm and Copenhagen, the Parliamentary Library and the Canberra based staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade through the invaluable briefings they provided to the delegation. I commend the report to the House.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FH4">Mr HUMPHREYS</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Griffith)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to southern Africa, July 1994. In July 1994 I had the honour of leading a delegation from this parliament to southern Africa visiting Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana and South Africa. The visit came at a time of significant political change in the region. This change is symbolised most markedly by the establishment of a non-racial government in South Africa led by President Nelson Mandela following the April 1994 election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation believes that Australia, because of the high regard in which it is held in the region, due to a large degree to its opposition to apartheid, is in a position to make a positive contribution to the development of democracy in the region. I should add that Australia's opposition to apartheid has been totally bipartisan, and I would like to mention the role played by successive Prime Ministers&mdash;Malcolm Fraser, Bob Hawke and Paul Keating&mdash;and pay a special tribute to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation has formed a number of conclusions about Australia's relationship with the region and puts these forward for consideration by both the Australian government and the Australian parliament. Unfortunately, however, at this crucial time on the road to democracy the financial resources available to AIDAB are at an all-time low. The delegation is convinced that Australia is making a positive contribution to the improvement in living standards in the region. Countries in the region are not seeking vast amounts of aid from Australia; however, aid from Australia is important to the region because Australia possesses expertise which can make a significant impact in particular areas, including health, education, housing, agriculture and sports development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report lists a number of areas in which the delegation believes that Australia can make a contribution. The aid program should focus on the transfer of Australian expertise to countries in the region. The delegation believes this can best be done by sending Australian experts to the region to advise and train, and by the training of personnel from the region in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the delegation appreciates that the Asia-Pacific region is the main focus of Australia's aid program, it is important that the positive contribution which Australia can make in southern Africa, and indeed the whole of Africa, should not be lost sight of. The delegation is firmly of the view that Australia's aid program to the region should not be decreased and indeed a persuasive case can be made for it to be increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the Presiding Officers of the Australian parliament, the delegation had the honour of formally inviting each parliament to send a delegation to Australia. The invitations were warmly received and have been accepted by Zimbabwe, Botswana and South Africa, all of whom will visit in the first half of 1995. I understand a favourable response is expected from Namibia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation wishes to make particular mention of the hospitality extended to it in Zimbabwe, Namibia and Botswana, where its visit was hosted by the respective parliaments. The three parliaments were extremely generous hosts, both in relation to the comprehensive meeting programs which were organised and in providing the delegation with the opportunity to visit areas such as Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe and Etosha in Namibia. The delegation also greatly appreciated the hospitality shown to it by the South African parliament during its visit to Cape Town. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation met with officials on several occasions prior to departure for discussions and briefing. The delegation would particularly like to express its appreciation to the officers from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, AIDAB, Austrade and the Parliamentary Library who participated in these meetings and who also contributed to the written briefs. The delegation particularly appreciated the opportunity to meet both before departure and on return with the South African and Zimbabwe High Commissioners&mdash;His Excellency Mr Steyn and His Excellency Professor Patel. The delegation wishes to thank the high commissioners for their valuable input to the delegation's program and also their helpful comments on our visit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the planning, coordination and administrative work associated with the visit was undertaken by the Parliamentary Relations Office. The delegation would like to record its appreciation of the efforts of the Parliamentary Relations Office in the preparation of an excellent program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the visit, the delegation was given comprehensive oral briefs and further briefing material by staff of the Australian High Commissions in both Zimbabwe and South Africa. They were also involved in making administrative arrangements for the visit. The delegation records its appreciation of the support given to it by the respective Australian High Commissioners and staff&mdash;in Zimbabwe, Mr Kerry Sibraa, a distinguished former President of the Senate, who has had a long interest in Africa; and, in South Africa, Mr Ross Burns. The delegation wishes to make particular mention of the quality of the briefings provided by the post in Zimbabwe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to express my appreciation to the members of the delegation&mdash;Senator John Coulter, Senator Dee Margetts, the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), and the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis)&mdash;for their support in what was an extremely interesting and informative visit. I should pay particular tribute to my deputy leader, Ms Trish Worth, for her invaluable assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, I want to make special mention on behalf of the delegation of the very hard working secretary, Mr Peter Roberts, who was available at any hour of the day or night to assist the delegation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to France and the European institutions, September-October 1994.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report provides a detailed record of our visit and achievements. At the outset I should say that I was privileged to lead a delegation that was single-minded in its efforts to represent Australia and advance our interests. The harmonious, cooperative and productive approach taken by all delegation members ensured that the visit was both rewarding and enjoyable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to record my personal thanks to the deputy leader, the honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman), who is in the House this afternoon, for his highly valued support, and to our colleagues, the honourable member for Brand (Ms Fatin), the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) and Senator Minchin. We also appreciated the pleasant company of Anne Fitzgibbon, Marjorie Lieberman and Kerry Minchin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time that I have available here I would like to make some brief comments on matters set out in more detail in the report. The delegation's visit to France provided a further opportunity to enhance the bilateral relationship and friendly relations which exist between the French and Australian parliaments. It also enabled us to gain a better understanding of one of the larger member states of the European Union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Strasbourg sector of the delegation's visit to the European institutions was marked by strong expressions of interest from the Council of Europe for closer cooperation with Australia in the future. The possibility of Australia obtaining observer status at the Council of Europe is one avenue which the delegation has recommended should be explored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst in Strasbourg the delegation had a major role in two initiatives which will enable Australia to make a stronger impact at the Council of Europe. Firstly, we responded positively to the proposal that the delegations from the Asia-Pacific appoint a co-rapporteur to assist in the preparation of the report and resolution on OECD activities by the Economic Affairs and Development Committee. The delegation strongly recommends that Australia vigorously pursue the opportunity to fulfil this role in 1995. If the role is to be taken seriously it may require a degree of continuity amongst the delegation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the delegation was instrumental in developing a strategy for the establishment of an Asia-Pacific group comprising parliamentary delegations from OECD member countries which are not members of the Council of Europe. The purpose of the group is to achieve more effective representation by cooperating on amendments affecting our region and indeed, where possible, presenting a regional perspective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's relations with the EU are of major importance, especially in economic terms. The creation of a single market offers substantial new trade and investment opportunities for Australian companies. There was also evidence of a marked rise in interest by the EU in the Asia-Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are obviously many people to thank for their contribution to the success of the visit and the report acknowledges their efforts and records our thanks to those involved. However, special mention should be made of our ambassadors to the OECD, France and Belgium and the European Community&mdash;Trevor Boucher, Alan Brown and Ted Pocock&mdash;for their excellent support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure all delegation members would wish me to join in acknowledging the significant roles played by Alice Gay, who looked after us so well during our entire visit to France, Jean-Louis Schroedt-Girard from the French Senate for his tireless efforts especially at La Grande Motte, Leo Cruise for his assistance at the Council of Europe's debate on the OECD, Ted Knez for his special efforts in both Strasbourg and Brussels, and Meg Pocock for her valued support which was appreciated by all of us, especially the accompanying spouses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report I have tabled clearly demonstrates the benefits of regular contact with European parliamentarians and officials and makes some significant recommendations to strengthen Australia's role at the Council of Europe and add value to future delegation visits. As my colleague the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) would say, by any measure the visit was a big success. I would also like to express on my own behalf, as well as the committee's, our appreciation to Michael Salkeld, the secretary of the delegation, for his valued contribution and input to the success of the delegation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have great pleasure in presenting to the House the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A review of Australia's efforts to promote and protect human rights.</EMPHASIS> In the brief time available to me today, I can only hope to touch on one or two aspects of the report. Human rights encompasses an enormous range of issues, from the very basic rights, such as the right to liberty and freedom from torture or arbitrary imprisonment, through to rights of freedom of expression and freedom of association.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's commitment to human rights is widely acknowledged. But, as with every aspect of human endeavour, there is still some room for improvement. The committee, in its recommendations, noted that there was room for great parliamentary involvement. I am particularly pleased to note that in relation to the treaty process, for instance, the government has decided to table treaties and debate the issue in the parliament before signature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matters raised during this inquiry have been very wide ranging, covering philosophical and legal questions of international law, the complexities of the United Nations human rights system, reform of the United Nations, bilateral relations and regional affairs and the place of human rights. We have also examined domestic policy on matters as diverse as peacekeeping, aid and human rights and questions of Australian compliance relating to indigenous people, women, children and workers. Issues of federal-state constitutional balance and whether a bill of rights is needed were also canvassed. The report contains chapters dealing with the United Nations, the Australian human rights framework, aid, trade and human rights, peacekeeping, indigenous people's rights and issues of minority rights and self-determination, to name just a few. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as examining the core matters set out in the committee's terms of reference, there was also a constant stream of requests for representation on human rights matters relating to individuals and groups, both in Australia and abroad. Many of these situations were particularly tragic and a number have been commented on in this report. The committee makes no claim to have examined all human rights problems throughout the world, as this is clearly beyond our capacity. However, submissions dealing with specific examples were considered carefully and were treated as representative of the types of human rights problems that occur, rather than as a definitive list of such abuses. It is a credit to all of those on the subcommittee that such a high level of unanimity was reached on such a report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report makes some 63 detailed recommendations, far too many for me to detail here. They include: proposing that the government explore with regional countries the possibility of establishing a regional dialogue on human rights through a range of mechanisms; urging the Australian government to promote, during debates on the reform of the United Nations, a discussion of the creation of a United Nations parliamentary assembly to monitor, among its responsibilities, human rights practices on a regular basis; recommending that the government reinstate the regular human rights reports from all Australian diplomatic posts, and urging the government to make provision, in resources and training, for officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to carry out the task; and recommending that AIDAB include a human rights impact statement in all their development assistance project proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A series of recommendations also flow from the subcommittee's visit to several Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory. Australia has often been criticised in the past for its treatment of our indigenous people. Many of Australia's indigenous people live in conditions which meet neither our commitment to them as fellow human beings nor our obligations under the international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights. These conditions are markedly below even those of the poorest `other' Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The visit to the Northern Territory in March 1994 confirmed the difficulties faced by the communities visited, and the need for urgent work to upgrade substandard conditions that exist. Recommendations are also made on a number of specific cases such as those of Mr James Peng, detained in China, and Mr Semyon Livshits, currently in detention in Vladivostok. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the second report the committee has produced on the subject of Australia's efforts to promote and protect human rights. The first was tabled in the previous parliament in 1992. It has been particularly noticeable that there has been an increase in the level of debate on the Australian government's policies on human rights. The work volume of the human rights subcommittee also reflects this. The volume of submissions to the committee has increased greatly over the two inquiries&mdash;from 88 in the first to 140 in the second&mdash;and the number of requests for meetings by various community groups has created an enormous increase in the workload. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee feels that its current structure and resourcing is inadequate to the task of dealing with the subject of human rights, and has therefore recommended that the human rights subcommittee be made a separate joint committee of the parliament, a recommendation which I heartily endorse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report is the result of 18 months of hard work by members of the human rights subcommittee, and I would like to acknowledge the dedication and commitment of the members of that subcommittee, so ably led by Senator Stephen Loosley. This most comprehensive report bears testament to their efforts and their commitment to human rights. I would also like to thank the secretariat staff, in particular the subcommittee secretary, Margaret Swieringa, for their assistance to the committee during the inquiry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, I present the following reports of the committee together with the minutes of proceedings: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Inquiry into the Sydney 2000 Olympics&mdash;the adequacy of existing and planned aviation services and infrastructure</EMPHASIS>; <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review inquiry into ship standards and safety</EMPHASIS>; and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Efficiency audit review: The national highway&mdash;Lifeline of the nation</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report on the Sydney 2000 Olympics deals with the adequacy of existing and planned aviation services and infrastructure. In its white paper on employment and growth of 4 May 1994, Working Nation, the government announced its decision to accelerate development of Badgerys Creek airport by constructing a runway capable of handling landings and take-offs of major aircraft. This decision has overtaken the importance of the inquiry. However, the question of whether Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport can cope with the 2000 games is still relevant. If it cannot, then the commissioning of Badgerys Creek airport&mdash;now called Sydney West airport&mdash;well before the games, is vital.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can SKSA cope with the 2000 games?  The conclusion of the committee is that it cannot. There is a prima facie case that the domestic terminal capacity at SKSA will not be able to cope with busy hour passenger movements in the Olympic year.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worst case scenario has to be avoided. The worst case will emerge if construction of Sydney West airport falls behind schedule in the late 1990s, leaving insufficient time to increase domestic terminal capacity at SKSA for the 2000 games. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has devised two strategies to avoid the worst case. Firstly, it asks the government to set target dates for the completion of the various stages of the Sydney West airport, and to publish that information. The second strategy requires a study, commencing about June 1998, to review the capacity of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport to cope with forecast passenger movements for the year 2000 and beyond. Appropriate recommendations have been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December 1992, the committee tabled its report into ship safety, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS>. This report received extensive support and coverage, in Australia and internationally. The committee considered the issues raised in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report to be important, and asked the Minister for Transport for a reference to monitor responses to its recommendations and developments in ship safety during the 37th parliament. The committee received the reference in December 1993, and is pleased to report that there has been improvement in several areas of ship safety regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The failure of some flag states to meet their International Maritime Organisation convention responsibilities is a serious ship safety issue. The IMO has established a flag state implementation subcommittee to examine the difficulties associated with this issue. The committee believes that noncompliance with convention requirements will not be properly addressed until the IMO has the ability to penalise flag states which do not comply. The committee has recommended along these lines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The operations of classification societies are also under scrutiny. The IMO has introduced set requirements which classification societies acting for flag states have to meet. Also, the International Association of Classification Societies has introduced several measures aimed at improving the quality of classification society services, including, for example, enhanced survey requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Crews are still being maltreated and abused on some ships. The government did not accept the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> recommendation that ships provide proof of compliance with the provisions of ILO 147. In this report, the committee calls on the government to reconsider its opposition to this requirement. The committee suggests that ships which are found not to comply with ILO 147 should be denied use of port loading and unloading facilities until deficiencies have been rectified. While Australia enforces ILO 147 standards, it has not ratified the convention. The committee recommends that the Commonwealth government expedite the ratification of ILO 147. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government also did not accept the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> recommendation requiring compulsory insurance cover for ships calling at Australian ports. The committee believes that the government should reassess its response to this recommendation. The use of port loading and unloading facilities should be denied to ships without insurance cover which are found to have entered Australian ports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In consultation with the committee, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority has redesigned its publication of monthly port state control information, to make it more easily understood by the public and the media, and is widening its distribution. The publication of port state control information is important for two reasons. Firstly, it highlights the owners, managers and charterers of substandard shipping and the flag states which protect them. Secondly, it gives a clear indication to those associated with substandard shipping that they will eventually be caught. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To help improve the effectiveness of Australia's port state control program as a deterrent, the committee has recommended that AMSA produce a set of performance indicators based on domestic regions. The committee believes that further improvement in ship safety standards is best achieved by adopting a package of measures aimed at improving the performance of the major players in international shipping&mdash;flag states, classification societies, ship owners and managers, charterers and cargo owners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee considers that recent initiatives at the IMO, the improvements in classification society services and increased port state control activity will improve ship safety. The committee will present its final report on ship safety to the parliament by the end of 1995. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Standing Committee on Procedure, I present the committee's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Application of modern technology to committee proceedings</EMPHASIS>, together with the minutes of the proceedings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr ROBERT BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 26 May 1994, the Speaker wrote to the committee, asking it to consider the possible application by committees of modern technology in fulfilling their functions, particularly in respect of the electronic collection of evidence&mdash;for example, through videoconferencing and teleconferencing. There is a large number of possible uses for technology by committees&mdash;for example, in the way material is communicated among members and the way information may be gathered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee decided that the use of technology for these kinds of administrative and informal purposes was a matter for each committee to decide, based on its need and the resources available. The inquiry was therefore restricted to the use of technology in the gathering of formal evidence and in conducting meetings. As well as written submissions, we were able to draw on the experience of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training for some first-hand views of the advantages and disadvantages of using videoconferencing and teleconferencing techniques. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We concluded that modern technology offers the opportunity for increased flexibility and effectiveness in the way committees work. We felt they should be able to use that technology in appropriate circumstances. However, it is important that the quality of evidence and the importance and dignity of committee proceedings be maintained. The committee has suggested that a number of conditions be placed on the use of technology to ensure that this happens, at least while new techniques are being tested and learned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taking evidence by electronic means requires committee members to develop a whole new set of skills, and these skills will take some time to acquire. The Procedure Committee hopes that, as technologies develop and change, the House and its committees will be able to harness the best aspects of them to make their committee work more effective and efficient, without jeopardising the value of the good work that our committees consistently produce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Procedure Committee also wants to place on record its appreciation of the assistance provided by Robyn Webber and Peter Fowler, both of whom acted as secretary to the committee, and the high level of personal commitment and professional competence which they and their colleagues applied to this inquiry and to the report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly on the report of the Procedure Committee and support the comments made by its chairman, the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown). As a member from Western Australia who travelled overnight last night on the midnight horror to get here, I could well understand that there is, let us say, the push to try to change the procedures of committees to use modern technology to allow for more widespread taking of evidence around the nation. It is a first-class move towards giving some of those who live in outlying districts a greater say in the activities of the federal parliament&mdash;and of course the committees are a very important part of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the Parliamentary Privileges Act, one of the considerations which the chairman would no doubt have liked to have talked about, had he had time, would have been whether evidence that is taken remotely is covered by parliamentary privilege. The clerk has given an opinion to the effect that that is the case only for that evidence that is taken within Australia's jurisdiction. Evidence that is taken remotely from overseas, of course, would not be subject to the Parliamentary Privileges Act of Australia, and that means that people concerned would be subject to the defamation laws that are applicable in those cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the matter of time constraints. Under most circumstances in a normal operating committee hearing the chairpeople, because of the human interaction there and then, have the opportunity of playing by ear to a certain extent and of allowing people to have a requisite amount of time to raise points&mdash;that is, on the part of the committee members&mdash;and, in the case of witnesses, the opportunity of allowing for the proper flow of questions to witnesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When dealing with a very expensive process such as teleconferencing more discipline is required on the part of a committee. There is going to be a lot more pressure on committee chairpeople to make sure that not only members of the committee are able to ask the questions that they require but also the witnesses themselves are given the opportunity of being able to respond properly and in a logical and sequential manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect is that there will be a requirement to plan more carefully in the case of remotely taken evidence to ensure that witnesses are brief or succinct in their comments and come to the point as quickly as possible so that members of the committee are able to get the information required and ask questions appropriately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, in view of the mixed response we had from the government in relation to the last committee report of the Procedure Committee, I can only urge the government in its response to support the recommendations of the committee fully. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZU5">Ms HENZELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report I have just tabled is a review of the implementation by Commonwealth, state and territory governments of the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. The vast majority of the 339 recommendations of the royal commission were supported by governments. The Commonwealth supported 338 of the 339.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This royal commission was established in 1987 in response to a growing public concern that deaths in custody of Aboriginal people were too common and public explanations were too evasive to discount the possibility that foul play was a factor in many of them. The royal commission found that the main reason so many Aboriginal people were dying in custody was that they were grossly overrepresented in both police and prison custody. It was this overrepresentation which led to the high number of deaths, as the rates of deaths in custody for indigenous and non-indigenous prisoners were comparable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the royal commission's report and its recommendations were directed towards reducing the overrepresentation of Aboriginal people in custody. Despite considerable outlays in excess of $100 million from the Commonwealth to date, the incarceration of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people has increased substantially when it should be decreasing. This is a prime performance indicator on which the royal commission implementation can be readily assessed. The performance on this measure has been appalling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The royal commission recommended that annual reports be made on the implementation of those recommendations accepted by governments. The committee saw it as of major importance to pay particular attention to the process of monitoring the implementation. The committee is quite critical of the lack of both comprehensiveness and effectiveness in the monitoring processes. In many instances, the annual reports gloss over deficiencies in the implementation, give responses which are irrelevant to the particular recommendation and, in some cases, give responses which are quite false. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 78 concerning the extension of aerodrome services to Aboriginal communities was supported by the Commonwealth, but action by the Department of Transport has been directly opposite to the thrust of the recommendation. Recommendation 110 called for a national study of pre- and post-release schemes for prisoners, following consultations with relevant Aboriginal organisations. DEET said that the study had been completed and that widespread consultation had been undertaken. In reality, only a preliminary study had been undertaken, with virtually no consultation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That so much of standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the time for presentation of committee and delegation reports and statements on those reports being extended until 1.20 p.m. this day.</PARA>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZU5">Ms HENZELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Similar deficiencies were noted in state and territory reports. The royal commission made several overarching recommendations which urged consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations at all stages of the implementation process. The royal commission also sought the maximum involvement of indigenous organisations in the delivery of consequent programs. The committee found that both of these recommendations had been poorly implemented.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that a more effective system is needed to monitor the implementation process. A number of witnesses referred to the problem of governments monitoring themselves. A key deficiency is the lack of any critical analysis of the implementation. More in-depth analysis is needed, rather than the mere collation of responses from various agencies which have constituted most of the implementation reports. The committee has recommended a separate and independent monitoring and evaluation unit be established under the Office of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, to independently monitor the implementation processes of Commonwealth, state and territory governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has concentrated on those recommendations directed to the diversion from custody of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Most states and territories have decriminalised public drunkenness in line with the royal commission's recommendation. Queensland and Victoria have been unacceptably slow to implement this recommendation. In many places, drinking in public has replaced public drunkenness as a standard charge for removing Aboriginal people from the streets. This is an unacceptable substitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The royal commission recommended that arrest be used as a sanction of last resort. Evidence indicates that this recommendation is not being properly implemented in most jurisdictions. The royal commission recommended against charging people for offensive language in situations where contact is initiated by the police. This recommendation is not being fully implemented. Many of those still being arrested for offensive language also end up with other charges such as resist arrest or assault police officer, by the time they arrive at the police station. This is quite contrary to the thrust of the royal commission's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The royal commission made recommendations to address the disadvantages faced by Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people in court. Many of these recommendations have not been fully implemented. The Commonwealth has been inexcusably slow in implementing the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission on the recognition of Aboriginal customary laws. People's basic human rights are breached daily, with cases being heard where the defendant has little or no fluency in English, yet no interpreter is provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the crucial question of police-Aboriginal relationships, significant improvements have been made in many areas. However, a number of places with significant Aboriginal populations have still not established effective community policing mechanisms. Many of these places were mentioned in the royal commission report as being over-policed or having poor police-Aboriginal relationships. The royal commission warned against policing priorities being based solely on non-Aboriginal perceptions, without consultation with Aboriginal people. The committee heard of, and visited, towns that are still grossly overpoliced. As the royal commission pointed out, this frequently increases the crime rate rather than reduces it, yet this inefficient and ineffective policing continues owing to poor management by senior police. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the referral of this inquiry in March, the committee agreed that it would report before the end of the year. It has been no mean feat to review 12,000 pages of evidence, to travel around Australia talking to as many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as possible, and then to prepare this substantial report in that time. I want to acknowledge the contribution of all those people who gave evidence, particularly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander individuals and groups. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the Motor Vehicle Standards Amendment Bill 1994. I am indeed introducing this bill again and I make no apology for that because I think it is about time the government woke up to what is going on around it. This is just another example of a government trying to overlegislate. We have had the design rule change in for nearly 2 1/2 years and there is still no evidence to show that it is in fact contributing to road safety.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the short time available I would like to quickly list some of the reasons why I think the government ought to be looking very closely at this private member's bill and agreeing not only to debate it but also to pass it through this house. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the bill specifically does is to remove the need for all new motorcycles to be hard wired with the headlight on&mdash;in other words, for the headlight to come on every time the engine is started. To start with, this has very strong opposition from motorcycle groups throughout Australia, particularly riders who have had a lot of experience in riding motorcycles on the road&mdash;people who ought to know, people who have got the experience. I would like to list nine reasons why I think this should be supported and the rule repealed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, there is no conclusive evidence, either in Australia or overseas, that by having compulsory lights on we do anything to improve the safety of motorcyclists or of other road users. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there is no doubt that there was lack of real consultation with the motorcycle groups by the government at the time it rushed this through. It was merely a case of wanting to be seen to do something for the sake of doing something. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the government's action removes the discretion of the motorcycle rider. It really should be the decision of the rider whether or not to have lights on. No-one is arguing that there are times when it is advantageous to have them on, but it should be the decision of the rider. There are many experienced riders who will argue that there are situations where it is downright dangerous to have the light hard wired on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth area of concern is the question of liability. No matter what reassurances the government might like to give, there is sooner or later going to be a case where, after an accident, a motorist is going to claim that the light was not on and, because of the smashed up motorcycle, the rider is not going to be able to prove the matter either way. There will be some question about who is liable for the accident and who is liable for damages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth reason is that the measure could very easily add to a false sense of security, because obviously, if riders are led to believe that having the light on somehow is going to make them safer, they could be more inclined to take risks when they should not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sixth reason is the sheer stupidity of the requirement for many applications for motorcycles today. Every farmer who buys an ag bike that can be registered has to buy a bike with a hard wired light. It is just nonsense riding around the paddock with a light on all day. If people happen to be idling along behind a mob of sheep or cattle, then probably they are going to flatten the battery as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The seventh reason is that the government's action gives it a feeling of having done something when in fact it has  done nothing when it comes to improving rider safety and improving education about road safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to add a couple of other reasons too. An inquiry undertaken by the State Parliament of Victoria in 1992 found possible dangers inherent in lights on, advised that lights on was inappropriate for Australian conditions and recommended that lights on remain voluntary. </PARA>

In fact, the shadow minister, Brian Langton, said he disagreed with the legislation because of insufficient evidence. I would like to challenge the government to produce some evidence in support of lights on. Failing that&mdash;and I do not believe it has that support&mdash;it ought to be big enough to admit that it has got it wrong and agree to support this private member's bill so that at least we can correct one of the many wrongs of this government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As President of the Australia-Kuwait Parliamentary Friendship Group, I had the great pleasure of leading our group on a 10-day visit to Kuwait. The invitation to visit Kuwait was extended by Sheik Salem Al-Sabah and I would like to thank him and everybody concerned, including my parliamentary colleagues, for a wonderful trip. I also would like to make special mention of Mr Abdul Jalil Albaf, an Australian businessman and chairman of the Kuwaiti Combined Friendship Association in Australia, who was able to organise the visit. Mr Albaf was ably assisted in those efforts by Mr Khalid Al-Ammar, who looked after the group from the Kuwaiti end.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rise to speak on an issue today of which many Australians are unaware. It is the continuing torment that the citizens of Kuwait suffer as a result of not knowing the fate of their missing persons and prisoners of war, still held by Iraq nearly four years after the conclusion of the Gulf War. There are some 625 documented cases of Kuwaitis and Third World country nationals missing since the occupation of Kuwait in 1991. While there is considerable evidence that those people were forcibly detained during the occupation and illegally deported to Iraq and that they are still incarcerated in Iraqi gaols, the Iraqi government continues to deny their existence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Iraqi regime continues to cry foul on the international stage, particularly about the United Nations imposed economic sanctions and the effect those sanctions have on the people of Iraq. I have no doubt that the sanctions have a profound effect on the people of Iraq and for that I am sorry. I feel no sorrow, however, for the government of Iraq or their mad leader. Let them ponder how profound an effect their actions in invading a sovereign country had on the people of Kuwait. Let them think for a moment how profound an effect their continuing refusal to release any information about the 625 detainees has on the families of innocent people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I sympathise with the people of Iraq, I can only say that their predicament is to a large extent of their own making. They continue to allow the current regime to suppress and subjugate them, to lead them further away from regional and international acceptance. Yet they do nothing about it. I understand that the regime in Iraq is feared by its people, but there have been other regimes feared equally, if not more, by their people and yet those people have managed to rise above their difficulties. I would suggest that it is time for the average Iraqi citizen to say, `Enough is enough' and to take to the task of removing Saddam Hussein and his oppressive regime. Maybe then we will achieve some progress for securing the release of the Kuwaiti detainees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">United Nations Security Council resolutions 686 and 687 of 1991 set out quite specifically the measures Iraq has to comply with in order to have economic sanctions lifted. Specifically, resolution 687 states that it has to arrange for the immediate release, under the auspices of the International Committee of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, of all Kuwaitis and Third World nationals detained and return the remains of any deceased Kuwaitis and Third World nationals so detained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this day, the Iraqi government continues to refuse to respond to Kuwaiti and international requests for information in relation to the 625 missing persons. It officially denies, at every opportunity, that it has any Kuwaiti or other national in its gaols. However, it also refuses to cooperate in a meaningful way with the International Committee of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, seeking, for instance, three days notice of any proposed gaol inspections. Suspicion is also raised by the fact that after 3 1/2 years of flat denial the Iraqis, in September of this year, released information relating to 45 detainees whom they say were released at the end of the desert war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to remind people that 625 Kuwaitis are equivalent to around 15,000 Australians, 50,000 British citizens, or 220,000 American citizens, should the same thing have happened in any of those countries. We are not talking about an insignificant number of Kuwaiti citizens. The Australian people, and the government and the opposition, have a very proud record of standing for the rights of other countries in situations such as this. In fact, we have always been very quick to support Kuwait in any way that we can. Likewise, we have been very supportive on the issue of sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the light of the continued reluctance of the Iraqi government to offer the necessary information on those detainees, I call on the honourable members of this House to support this motion and I call on the government to maintain its strong support for Kuwait and to maintain its principled stand on the economic sanctions against Iraq. I believe this is the only chance that the Kuwaiti people will ever have of seeing their loved ones again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion. In formally seconding the motion, I want to say three things briefly. The first is that the motion itself, of course, addresses the significant problem of the 625 detainees, whose fate remains undisclosed. The resolution is designed not only to give support to the efforts by the government of Kuwait in seeking the return or the identification of the whereabouts of those 625 persons but to put pressure on both the Australian government and the international community to maintain sanctions against Iraq, both to seek the return of those 625 persons, or their identification, and to ensure that Saddam Hussein and the government of Iraq desist from their efforts to overrun the small neighbouring state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia played a very significant role during the effort to reclaim Kuwait. Each of us on that visit was very proud to hear of the efforts by Australians&mdash;and particularly by the Royal Australian Navy in the Gulf commitment&mdash;in enforcing the sanctions and ultimately ensuring victory in the Gulf War. The unjustifiable occupation by Iraq of Kuwait is something that people need to register for the true impact that it had not just on the people of Kuwait but on stability in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of great concern that the people of the world understand that Kuwait, though a small nation, is the only one of the Gulf states that presently has a form of democracy. It is a democracy which does mean that there is a process which allows the people of that nation&mdash;alone in the Middle East&mdash;to express some say in the processes of government. I believe Kuwait is setting the pace not only in that respect but also in its efforts in the wider world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a major investor, Kuwait is significant economically. As a major purchaser of live sheep&mdash;and I know that my colleague the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) intends to say a little about that in a moment&mdash;it is particularly important to Australia. I do commend Mr Geoff Collins, who prepared this report which we table today, and the recommendations in it, which suggest that greater emphasis needs to be placed by Austrade and by the Australian government in representations in Kuwait, firstly, at a diplomatic level and, secondly, at an Austrade-consultate level. It is a market which we need to do far more to extend and develop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to extend particular thanks to a number of people for the visit. First, of course, I thank Sheik Salem Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah, who was our host. There is little doubt that his generosity and that of his colleagues was quite extraordinary. Each of us came away not only in his debt but also having a greater understanding of the circumstances of Kuwait. I thank Mr Abdul Jalil Albaf, who I am glad to see is in the audience today, and Mr Collins, who is with him. Mr Abdul Jalil Albaf certainly played a significant role in facilitating the visit, and we are very much in his debt. I thank Mr Khalid Al-Ammar, whose great help during the course of the visit permitted us to get into a number of places that otherwise have been impossible for us. My thanks also go, of course, to the Emir and to the Crown Prince, who is the Prime Minister, and then to each of the others who played such important roles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the Australians, I would mention one who is identified as a warden there, Mr John Levins. He is the only Australian, as I understand it, who stayed through much of the occupation. He is someone of whom we can all be very proud, because of the role he played during the occupation. Ours was a visit which really gave many of us an understanding of the contribution Kuwait can make in the future to the Middle East and to the wider world, and I do commend to the government the text of this motion and of the report. I urge that every effort be made to identify and seek the return of those 625 detainees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Secretary of the Australia-Kuwait Parliamentary Friendship Group, I am very pleased to join with my colleagues the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace) and the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) in support of this most important resolution before the Australian parliament. As the earlier speakers have indicated, we were very privileged indeed to be a group of parliamentarians who visited the state of Kuwait as a guest of Sheik Salem Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah, the Chairman of the National Committee for Missing Persons and POW Affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most moving reminiscences that I have of that particular visit was meeting with Mrs Marafi, the wife of one of the missing men, and with Mrs Mondari, the mother of a missing daughter. These ladies were at a meeting dealing with this very issue of missing persons and POWs. It would have been a very tough person indeed who came out of that meeting without feeling a great deal of sympathy for the 625 missing and POWs and their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was an important visit for Australian parliamentarians to make, because it gave us an indication of the dimension of this very important human rights issue. We pride ourselves in this parliament on addressing issues of fundamental breaches in human rights. There was certainly a massive breach of human rights in the actions of the departing Iraqi government troops in detaining 625 people as they fled from their own country, the sovereign state of Kuwait, in February 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular delegation gave every indication to our hosts that we would take all necessary steps, and use any opportunities in parliamentary forums such as this, and in organisations such as Amnesty International, in contacts with organisations such as the Red Cross, in contacts with people from the United Nations, and with groups that we visit from the European Union, to bring to people's attention the gross violation of human rights and the fact that we have so many of these people still missing from the state of Kuwait. As the honourable member for Fowler indicated, this is the equivalent of some 15,000 Australians missing in action; and one can only ponder what sort of reaction we would have as a nation if that situation were the case here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also pay tribute to the Chairman of the Kuwait Combined Friendship Association of Australia, Mr Abdul Jalil Albaf, who facilitated our trip; to his very good friend, Mr Khalid Al-Ammar, the Vice-Chairman of the Kuwait Combined Friendship Association; and, of course, to our great and generous host, Sheik Salem. It was a most important trip. There were of course many other issues that the group were exposed to, and I have no doubt that other people will comment upon these in the course of their remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the people of Kuwait continually express their admiration for the people and the parliament of Australia for their assistance in their time of need in 1990 and 1991. I know that the motion before the House does enjoy bipartisan support. We do have, as a nation, a very proud reputation of supporting human rights issues. This is a very obvious example of an issue that deserves bipartisan support. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Kuwait is a remarkable place despite being only 17,800 square kilometres of flat, desolate sand, barely one-twentieth of the size of my own electorate of Parkes, and with a rainfall of less than five inches a year. It has been independent since 1961. It purchases almost two million of our live sheep every year worth $20 million to $30 million to the farmers of Australia. It is probably the only country in the world that does not have a river or a railway line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a remarkable country because of its oil, which was first discovered in 1938. Some of the wells today are flowing with the same pressure as when they were first discovered. It is remarkable because of its strategic position at the top of the Arabian or Persian Gulf, wedged between Iraq and Saudi Arabia. It is particularly remarkable because of its people, who are open, friendly and dedicated to making the world a better place in which to live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing that struck me when I arrived there was that there was hardly any sign whatsoever of the 1990 war. Kuwait City is a very modern city and the war damage has been 99 per cent repaired. I share the deep concern of previous speakers for the 625 prisoners of war which Iraq still has. Iraq should return these prisoners or at least account for them. I think it is outrageous that Iraq has not done so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of the war and the cost of the subsequent rehabilitation would be something of the order of $100 billion, and if Saddam Hussein had never been born the world would be that much richer today. Of course, Saudi Arabia, the United States, Japan and Kuwait bore the brunt of that cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The oil, of course, is what much of Kuwait is about. At the end of the war Iraq blew up 727 Kuwaiti oil wells, pipelines, and storage and other facilities. There were six million barrels a day polluting the atmosphere as a result of tremendous fires. But within a few months, with great effort from countries all around the world, the fires were put out. Those wells had to be redrilled and today Kuwait is back in full production producing two million barrels a day, with the price of oil being about $14 a barrel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that struck me about the country was how they treat the women there. In public the women, though it is not compulsory, in large part wear black robes and head veils. Some have their face exposed, some only their eyes exposed, whilst some do not even have their eyes exposed. In Saudi Arabia they have to wear gloves as well. All this is changing in Kuwait and in many ways it is leading the Arab nations into the 21st century. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a country which is different to Western eyes. Yet we should not judge Kuwait from Western perspectives. It has a democratic process, which is unusual in Gulf states. It is presenting to the world an image, despite the great damage suffered as a result of the Iraqi invasion and the great pain its people suffered, of growth and confidence in the future. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Its people are the most charming and hospitable I have encountered in my visits to other parts of the world. Indeed, my friend Khalid was a most charming, delightful human being and hosted us in a most charming, gracious way. His friend Waleed, whom we met, was also a person of quite distinctive characteristics. He was prone to call us `My dears', and has a V12 Mercedes-Benz which, we are told, travels at quite alarming speeds. He was a most charming human being, despite the fact that he had a different culture and a different background from ours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">War is always painful. I suppose no-one would suggest there ever is a war which in any way, sense or form is justifiable in moral terms. But Kuwait has suffered an unusual indignity, in that some 625 people are classified as missing or are prisoners. That indignity is furthered by the fact that Kuwaitis cannot get information. They cannot get information as to whether they are, in fact, dead people, or whether they are held by the Iraqi government in various prison camps. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you put that 625-odd people into Australian terms, based on relative population bases, it would run into thousands of people. Thousands of Australians would be in that category, had we been in the same position. To the Kuwaiti people, 625 people is a lot of people. Very few Kuwaiti families are not affected, in emotional terms, by the fact that they cannot get information on where those people are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's role in the United Nations is most important. I, like my colleagues here, fully support Australia's role in ensuring that the sanctions against Iraq are maintained, and stressing the view that, until Iraq wants to become part of the civilised world, it should be treated as an outcast. Until Iraq wishes to reveal details of where those 625 people are, be they alive or dead, or to reveal details of their deaths, Iraq should be treated as an outcast and kept out of the world of civilised nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very grateful for the friendship and assistance of Mr Abdul Jalil Albaf, who was indeed a very useful friend to have on the visit. He understands both the culture and the customs of Kuwait, and was most useful in explaining to us areas of interest and of differences. I believe that we were all very privileged, as members of the Australian parliament, to visit the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, let me say that, until Australia wakes up to itself, until Austrade wakes up to itself and until Australia starts dealing seriously with countries where we have enormous economic benefit potential, we deserve to be a poor trader. The Gulf imports almost everything it uses. It exports oil. We have not got a consulate in Kuwait. I believe we have got to change our attitude. We really need to get into these marketplaces. We need to understand the differences that exist, in cultural terms, between Australia and countries like Kuwait, and we need to get a bit more clever in the way we do things. I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

As a member of the unofficial delegation which recently visited Kuwait, I am most grateful to have gained first-hand experience of the issues facing Kuwait. The obvious conclusion I have drawn from this experience is that much is to be gained from close links and friendships between our two countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the delegation are acutely aware of the suffering and emotional devastation which Iraq has inflicted upon the families of Kuwait. We need to ask ourselves how we would feel if Australia had been invaded and some 15,000 Australians had been taken hostage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Kuwaiti people need our support in international forums to secure the release of their missing persons. It was a particularly emotional experience to have conveyed to us, first-hand, the tragedies suffered by Mrs Marafi, whose husband is missing, and also the continuing suffering of Mrs Mondani, whose very beautiful daughter is missing. Three of us visited the home of Ali Al-Qabandi for a `diwanah'. We thank Ali for his hospitality. This was not part of our official itinerary but was arranged by John Levins, an Australian warden and one of 350 Australians and New Zealanders residing in Kuwait. John Levins is a great Australian and we are grateful for the time that he spent with us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similar stories of suffering and hardship for families were again related in this less formal setting. It was here that I was also asked to pass on their regards to all Australians. Walid, `My Dear', was one of our hosts, and he had personally suffered at the hands of the Iraqis. We are grateful for the hospitality shown by Sheik Salem and the arrangements made by Abdul Jalil Albaf and Khalid Al Ammar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note the links that exist from my home city of Adelaide with Kuwait. David David of our internationally famous cranio-facial unit has worked there and has had professionals and patients from Kuwait in Adelaide. Alexander McFarlane from the Adelaide University has worked with Kuwaitis on post-traumatic stress disorders. There is a potential for these links to be further strengthened and also for Kuwaiti students to study in Australia. An official Australian presence in Kuwait would be most helpful. Our currently healthy live sheep trade should not be taken for granted, given the fact that South Africa is now in competition. </PARA>

Because most of the speakers before me have covered a lot of ground I will be fairly brief, but I would like to take the opportunity to thank Sheik Salem Al-Sabah for his invitation to visit Kuwait and for the great hospitality that was displayed to all members of the delegation. I would also like to thank the member for Fowler (Mr Grace) for his great organisation, as has been mentioned before, and Jeff Collins, his chief of staff, for the preparation of this report. Jeff was with us all the way and provided a great support service for us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Abdul Jalil Albaf, who accompanied us on the journey. I thank him very much for his courtesy and his patience with all of us, particularly in the explanation of the Muslim religion. While we read a great deal about this religion and its place in world history and the world today, I think very few of us understand what it is all about and perhaps we might ask some strange questions sometimes. I would like to thank Abdul, as we know him, for his explanations in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very important, as other speakers have said, that we do have a diplomatic office in Kuwait. There is no doubt, when you go there and speak to expatriate Australians and others who are very keen to see an increase in trade between Kuwait and Australia, that we need some representation there, someone that they can touch base with. And I think it is important that we see other countries like Japan, the United States, Germany and all of those who are interested in trade have trade fairs in Kuwait. Australia has not had one and I do not think it intends to have one but, if we want to get our produce into Kuwait, particularly as a niche market, we must have a trade fair there at least once a year to show what we produce in Australia and to make sure that that produce is on display for the Kuwaitis to see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to support what has been said about the 625 prisoners of war. We must keep the pressure on. We must find out what has happened to those people, whether they are alive or dead. If they are alive, we must make sure that they are returned from their prisons. I would also like to pay tribute to the Australians who are working in Kuwait, those people who are making a contribution there&mdash;developing the friendship and the ties between Kuwait and Australia. As has already been mentioned by the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), John Levins AO, MBE is a remarkable young Australian who has a great insight into the Kuwaiti people and into the Middle East in general, and it was a pleasure to speak with him in Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally I would like to thank Sheik Saleem Al-Sabah for affording us the opportunity of having the great honour of meeting the Emir of Kuwait, His Highness Sheik Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah.

As well as that, I want to put on the public record my sincere appreciation for the effort that our good friend Mr Abdul Jalil Albaf went to to arrange this visit to Kuwait so that we could have a far greater understanding of both the economic situation in Kuwait and the social issues that its people are facing.

With changing ground as far as the political situations in Iraq and Iran are concerned, there is great opportunity for Australia to participate in a far greater way as far as trade is concerned.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)calls on the Government to legislate to stop the practice.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a matter I have raised previously in this House. It is a matter of some concern to me, just as it is a matter of some concern to the people who are affected by what is, effectively, very unfair competition from university employed lecturer-researchers for private sector consultants, particularly in areas where there is direct competition. I have also raised the matter of so-called corporatised departments of the federal government or federal government organisations engaging in unfair competition with private sector consultants or organisations providing similar services. At one stage I was dealing with a company that was in competition with Auslig, the federal government's surveying organisation. In Western Australia, in the case of that state's universities, there has been an absolutely damning report on the lack of accountability on the part of some academics in passing on costs to those who are employing them as consultants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other points I want to raise in introducing my motion is the question of the people who have been disaffected or affected by the practice and who have no recourse because normal corporate controls do not apply to this particular situation. In fact, unless the universities enforce the guidelines for the work that is being undertaken by employed academics in competition with private sector organisations then, effectively, nobody else will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In moving this motion, there is no way in the world that I am considering or attempting to suggest that university personnel ought not to engage in consultancy work. Not at all. In fact, it is absolutely critical, if we are to become the clever country that we have spoken about at some length in this House and about which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has spoken in the past, that we ensure our universities are fully participating in the research and work that is being undertaken across the breadth of the community in relation to scientific and technical research and work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I have drawn my views on this particular matter from a range of sources, not the least of which was the recent report of the Auditor-General of Western Australia on the accountability of this type of practice, but also from the case study of a constituent of mine, a Mr Alan Lloyd, who has had a number of particular experiences in competing in the area of research for oil exploration with university employed consultants. In using the words `the clever country', we do not want to place any impediments in the path of Australia becoming a clever country, but it is important that we do not effectively place a disadvantage on one clever Australian in competition with another clever Australian. In the absence of private sector competition, where academics employed by universities are consulting and are not actually competing directly, obviously there is not the same level of severity of the problem; nonetheless, there is an interest in accountability and the use or the enforcement of the same or similar set of principles in relation to the proper accounting of the costs of the resources used in that type of research.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The practice of university employed academics offering their skills and techniques to the wider community is an important feature in our national economic activity and scientific research activity. But when those facilities or services are provided by those academics to the corporate sector at a vastly cheaper rate than services provided by an equivalent private consultant, questions need to be asked obviously as to the fairness of the situation. I mentioned earlier that I raised the matter in June in an adjournment debate. Prior to that in October 1993, after corresponding with the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), I received a reply from him in which he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Universities engage in consulting and have developed guidelines to regulate the process. Such guidelines generally require the charging of market rates for work undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA>The Western Australian Auditor-General does not agree with this. His report cites the universities in Western Australia as failing to comply with such guidelines. He has given as a reason:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are no procedures for charging staff for the use of university facilities.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a wide body of evidence to suggest that the current policy of self-regulation involved in the costing of academic research and consultant services is, at best, ineffective and, at worst, shoddy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely it is not too much to expect that private consultants and university employed academics should compete on an even footing for work in the community. Recently the Western Australian Auditor-General released a damning report on the practices of universities as far as adequately passing on the costs of such services to clients was concerned. In the executive summary of performance examination of university consultancy services, tabled in the Western Australian parliament on 5 October this year, the Auditor-General states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where universities are not charging academic staff for the use of resources, the university is incurring costs which should be incurred by the academic. This gives the academic an unfair advantage in the market place and reduces the ability of the university to achieve its goals with its given resources.</PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Forty two per cent of university schools and departments sampled were not adhering to the consultancy policies and guidelines of their university.</PARA>
<PARA>For those who may consider opposing this motion, it is not good enough simply to say that the universities and other higher education institutions have policies in place to ensure unfair competition does not occur because it is clear from the findings of the Western Australian Auditor-General that, in the case of the Western Australian universities, this is not the case. It is clear that the rules, if not being ignored, are not being given much attention. The Auditor-General made several other observations about universities accounting for their services. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The examination found that while all university heads . . . were aware of the consultancy service policy and guidelines, many were not adhering to all aspects. Most examples related to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1) The approval processes for external consultancy and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2) The lack of procedures to enable staff to be charged for resources used.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, many university employed consultants were getting almost a free ride on the public purse simply because it was too difficult to adequately determine what resources were used, what they cost and to whom they should be charged. The result is that the final cost of such consultancies is well below the market rate of the services offered by those in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General's report found that, of Western Australian institutions, the percentage of noncompliance with existing guidelines was very high indeed. Edith Cowan University had a 59 per cent noncompliance rate; Curtin University had a 37 per cent noncompliance rate; the University of WA, 36 per cent; and Murdoch University, 33 per cent. Reasons given for the noncompliance included claims that `academic staff did not see the need to inform their relevant head about external consultancy work', `the university policy does not set the rates to be charged for the use of university equipment' and `there are no procedures for charging for the use of university facilities'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, there is a very serious problem here. It is interesting to note that there are no sanctions on noncompliance in any of the policies of the guidelines of the universities. The Auditor-General also expressed concern that university employed academics doing consultancy work might be seen to be working on behalf of the university itself. This raises all sorts of legal problems. Indeed, the Auditor-General sought a legal opinion on this important matter which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no action which the university can take to eliminate the possibility of liability for the activities of an academic carrying out private consultancy work, other than to ensure that it is not such as would reasonably lead a client or some other third party reasonably to form the view that the academic was not carrying out private work but rather work on behalf of or in the course of his employment with the university.</PARA>
<PARA>The auditor concluded that `with the clear risk of legal liability being transferred to the university' it was essential that staff adhere to policies related to private consultancies and that, once performed, the university take steps to make it obvious to all involved that the work was not conducted on behalf of the university. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned the case of my constituent, Mr Alan Lloyd, who is a micropalaeontologist. He is highly regarded in this field, which includes consultancy work related to the shoring up of prospects for oil exploration. He, like most other businessmen, has expended a large amount of money in capital equipment&mdash;about $130,000. Naturally enough, in order to recover his money, he has to include part of these outlays in the charges to his clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is that university employed academics do not work under such constraints&mdash;as was the case in the specific example where Mr Lloyd was quite significantly undercut by a university employed academic&mdash;nor are there any other sources of redress when a private consultant is undercut by academic competition. In fact, under the Trade Practices Act, because it would require a corporation to be involved, there is absolutely no recourse for somebody in that situation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) has raised an interesting and important question. It is in two parts: the first relates to the issue itself and the second relates to how to deal with it. Those two parts need to be dealt with separately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first issue of the practice of university employed academics using uncosted university facilities raises an important ethical and financial question. University scholars have at least three responsibilities: to teach, to do research and to make their knowledge available to the wider community. The honourable member for Moore conceded that it was quite appropriate and proper for university staff to be engaged in consulting work, and I strongly support that too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The question is one of balance and accounting. How do you encourage and ensure that university staff give principal priority to their teaching and research responsibilities, which are the core of the tasks for which they are appointed, but allow them and enable them to use the skills that they build up through that intellectual activity in the wider community? It is very difficult in practice to find a way of achieving that balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Various universities act in different ways to try to achieve that balance. Some universities set an upper limit on the amount of time that scholars should be involved in consulting. Some universities set an upper limit on the amount that scholars are allowed to earn through consulting work in addition to their salary. Sometimes universities require that part of those funds be put into a university research fund. There are various ways in which it can be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite a difficult issue, but I agree with the honourable member for Moore that there is an ethical issue here. University staff should be expected to give principal attention to teaching, and if they take on too many consulting tasks then they will not be able to do that. At a time when many university staff feel that their own salaries have not grown as fast as they should, there is a strong incentive for them to take on extra consulting work and earn additional funds. That has to be constrained in some way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a way it is ironic that the opposition is raising this issue. In a sense, what is involved is an extension of the market into an area where, for a large part of intellectual history, the market did not operate in any price fixing sense. It was an area where, half a century ago, people might have even voluntarily given advice to people outside universities. But we are now in a position where the market has spread into many areas, and the opposition tends to favour that very strongly. It favours leaving that as unregulated as possible. For the previous opposition speaker, the honourable member for Moore, to propose a very tough regulatory regime is somewhat surprising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leads me to the second part of the motion, which deals with how the issue should be regulated. I am not persuaded that federal legislation is necessarily the way to go. It is a complex issue. It is hard to find the right balance when you are actually in university. A better way to handle it may be to encourage universities themselves, or possibly the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee in consultation with universities, to draw up standardised guidelines and then apply those in a rigorous, fair and comprehensive way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree that it is important that university facilities not be abused and that there be proper financial accounting when facilities are used by staff. The core point of the honourable member for Moore is thoroughly reasonable, but it is probably better for universities themselves to set those guidelines. It may be done in conjunction with the Vice-Chancellors Committee. There could possibly be some role for DEET, the Department of Employment, Education and Training, in encouraging that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really doubt whether legislation is the way to do it because it is probably better handled conceptually in a more decentralised way and also because of the difficulty in drawing up legislation in an area where ethical and accounting issues, which are specific to universities, are so closely involved. We also have to be aware of the importance of academic freedom. One does not want the government to intrude into academic freedom. The honourable member's proposal could be perceived as doing that. For that reason, it is probably better for the universities to take on this task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not use all the time available to me because the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) went over time. In summary, I believe the honourable member for Moore has a valid point and a valid concern that it is appropriate, both ethically and financially, for some enforceable guidelines of the sort he is talking about to be prepared, but I would suggest that that might be better done within the universities and possibly in a coordinated way through the Vice-Chancellors Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, I make it perfectly clear that I certainly have no intention of attacking university academics. They do an absolutely  admirable job in our country. The members who preceded me in this debate, the member for Moore (Mr Filing) and the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), have talked about the three functions that academics perform in our country&mdash;that is, teaching, research and publication. The consulting work comes after publication because they are disseminating their knowledge and what they have learned at the public expense, and the excellence they have developed in their fields of endeavour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we remember as we examine this issue what it is basically all about. We are for competition, but I think all of us are for fair competition, not unfair competition. The honourable member for Moore has pointed out that the Auditor-General in Western Australia has brought down a report in this regard. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of 4 November highlights the Auditor-General's report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Auditor-General Des Pearson has found that nearly half the WA academics who earn millions of dollars moonlighting avoid guidelines on payment for the use of university facilities.</PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting to see what the Labor Party opposition education spokesman, John Halden, said. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . he would move to have the Legislative Council's government agencies committee investigate the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"There has to be greater accountability at universities, although I would not reject consultancy as a bad thing. For universities to find themselves in this position is really disgraceful," he said.</PARA>
<PARA>I suspect that that is true because unfair competition makes life difficult for everyone. Last year, I had a case in my electorate where a private sector company that does aerial mapping and sells its maps to local government agencies and others in the private sector found itself suddenly in competition with the Department of Administrative Services, in conjunction with a private company, doing spec work. They rented an aircraft and used government facilities. The private sector company was then going to blow up the photographs of the aerial maps. They were using government facilities to undercut the market in order to establish a place for themselves in the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was clearly unfair competition using taxpayers' money to fund the operation. That was hardly fair for the private sector company. Had it been one private sector company competing against another that was willing to write off its own money in order to gain a toehold in the market, it would have been fair. But it was not fair to use our money in that manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government departments in Canberra now charge each other for their services. The Attorney-General's office, when it is asked for legal advice by, say, the Department of Employment, Education and Training, charges for that advice on a full cost recovery basis. The point the member for Moore is making is that we want fair competition. Certainly it is reasonable and desirable for our academics to do consultancy work and to use their knowledge and their experience in the broader community and to do so on a full cost recovery basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Fraser suggested that there may be mechanisms other than regulation which may achieve the same result, and I would agree. If those mechanisms can work and are sensible, we would certainly support them. Regulation by federal government should be the court of last resort but, up to this point, the universities appear either unable or unwilling to police their own regulations in order to make them work and to make sure that they are effective. Whatever mechanisms are set in place, the importance of today's debate is that we highlight to the tertiary education community that we would like for it to get its house in order. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some sympathy with the concerns raised by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) in his motion before the House today. They touch upon a broader issue: the nature of the relationship between academic institutions and those people who work in them and the broader community. Particularly in the commercial context, there are a number of quite controversial issues that all of us in public life need to give some consideration to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not all that keen on the text of the motion, so I find it difficult to support, even though the situation that the honourable member for Moore has adverted to probably does require some serious consideration. I note that in his contribution he made references to a wide body of opinion without actually citing who the wide body actually is. Clearly, the Western Australian Auditor-General has conducted a study of the use of university facilities by academics and has reached, on the face of it, certain fairly worrying conclusions. How much further than that it goes I am obviously not in a position to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that the motion moved by the honourable member for Moore does not make it clear that he is seeking to address the practice of university employees using facilities for their own purposes. I suggest that this motion is capable of being interpreted as referring to universities and other tertiary institutions actually conducting research and competing in the private sector for consultancies, which is a different matter but equally controversial in many respects. I take it that the motion refers to people doing `foreigners' and that, therefore, that is what we need to focus on in the discussion today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is considerable difficulty in drawing lines in these situations. In the scientific area, there are some questions about the use of scientific facilities. Take for example a historian who is contracted to write a book on the history of an organisation. Should we therefore charge that person for using the university library to which he or she happens to be a member? Barristers who also lecture in law obviously get considerable benefit in their own practices from their lectureship in tertiary institutions. How do you define that benefit and how do you demark it in order to ensure that there is a competitive level playing field? In many areas there are some obvious difficulties in drawing boundaries to ensure that what is a legitimate principle can be applied properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth pointing out that the very thing the honourable member for Moore raises, namely, the need for some degree of competitive neutrality between public sector organisations or individuals relying on public sector resources and the private sector, is enshrined in draft federal government legislation as a result of the Hilmer report under the title <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National competition policy</EMPHASIS>. There is a proposed  code  entitled  `Competition principles', which is sought to be entered into between the federal government and the states, which, in clause 3, subclause 3 and clause 3, subclause 5, sets out a set of principles to ensure that competitive neutrality does apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a number of concerns about this issue and a number of other issues in the proposed Hilmer legislation. But it is fair to say that the general thrust of what the honourable member for Moore is pursuing&mdash;namely, to ensure that where public sector organisations are involved in competing with the private sector it is done on a fair basis&mdash;is already being pursued by the government. My concerns relate to how far that should extend and whether that should extend into areas such as education and health. Nonetheless, what the honourable member is asking the government to do has already been done, in a general sense&mdash;the general principle has already been pursued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I concur with the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) that the problem is the failure of universities to adhere to their own guidelines. If the figure of 42 per cent is correct and if we have taxpayer funded facilities being used purely for private gain, which appears to be the case, then clearly that is a problem. But, by the sound of the honourable member's own contribution today, the real problem is in the enforcement of the guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first port of call in tackling this problem should be to consider whether the enforcement of the guidelines could be improved. It really is a last resort to have federal government interference in these sorts of things when they should be capable of being resolved at the university level&mdash;taking into account the fact that there are significant difficulties in ensuring that the areas have been properly demarked. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to cover a couple of points. The member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) has raised an important point&mdash;a matter that the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) raised in a letter dated 26 May 1994. He said in his letter:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While I generally support competition for the efficiency benefits that it provides, there are some exceptions. In particular, it would not be appropriate, as you indicate, for private sector suppliers to be crowded-out as a result of subsidised prices charged by public researchers. This issue has been addressed recently in a report on `Costing and Pricing of Public Sector Research', 1992. In this report, prepared by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the importance of full cost pricing was stressed (and broadly agreed between members of the working group which included CSIRO and Universities). As a result, major researchers have been pressed to employ more efficient pricing practices for their external work, thus minimising any `downside' to competitors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those are noble sentiments. What the member for Melbourne had to say was partly correct. The difficulty is in the application of the guidelines. It is clear from the Auditor-General's report in Western Australia that that is not occurring in the cases of the four universities in Western Australia. I dare say that they are not orphans and that a similar situation probably exists elsewhere in the country, although there is no scientific evidence. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">University control over staff taking on private consultancy work was found to be minimal with the universities unable to advise of how many or which of their staff were engaged in private consultancy work. Universities were even reluctant to estimate the number of staff involved. The best estimate obtained was that the proportion of staff involved was "significant".</PARA>
<PARA>The difficulty is in relying on the universities to perhaps enforce their own guidelines, which clearly, in the case of these universities, they are not doing. Where do private sector consultants, those who are in the business sector and who are competing with publicly funded or subsidised employed academics, go for recourse? If they go to a university, they have little to no influence other than to make a complaint, as any other person may have, to the senate of the university to take some action. One of my constituents wrote to the Senate of the University of Western Australia and was told that everything was okay and that there were no grounds for his complaint. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Auditor-General had not come out with this report, one could have perhaps concluded that the university had made its own conclusions based on some thorough research, but it is clear from the Auditor-General's report that the universities are not able to do that. In fact, in some cases the best estimate obtained was that the proportion of staff involved was significant. In other words, there is very little to no accountability in relation to the question of university academics taking on consultancy work.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since the 1970s, in Australia it has been a feature of public policy considerations that the urban design debate has focused primarily on central business districts. In truth, the real victims of urban design in this country are more likely to live in public housing estates on the urban fringe than to be among those who frequently visit the centre of our major cities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Traditionally, federal housing policies have focused much more on affordability than on livability. Just as much, state housing agencies have concentrated more on rental collection than on effective asset management and renewal. This has been a real problem in terms of the management of important public housing assets, which total $31 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Across Australia, federal and state governments have invested a huge amount in public housing, and state housing authorities have not given due and proper attention to the management of that substantial asset base. About 70 per cent of the public housing stock in Australia is occupied by social security recipients, the majority of whom are sole parents or the single elderly. Unquestionably, affordability matters to these tenants. I commend the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe) for establishing an affordability benchmark by which low income tenants&mdash;public and private&mdash;should pay no more than 30 per cent of their income on rent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is important to recognise that livability issues&mdash;the built environment and quality of life&mdash;in public housing estates are just as significant and just as critical as housing affordability. I need move no further than my own electorate to demonstrate this point. The four large public housing estates in the local government area of Campbelltown in the south-west of Sydney&mdash;Glenquarie, Minto, Claymore and Airds, with a total of more than 5,000 dwellings&mdash;reflect many of the planning and urban design errors of the 1970s and 1980s. These estates were designed on the Radburn model&mdash;a planning scheme first developed in the United States in the 1920s to separate cars from pedestrians in housing estates. It is an appalling reflection on urban design standards in Australia to think that an experimental planning model drawn up overseas in the 1920s still produces serious social and amenity problems in Australia in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Radburn plan has produced a series of dysfunctional cul-de-sacs and private open space, underutilised public open space, regimented design features, maintenance difficulties and substandard housing appearance and amenities. It is totally unsuited to the lifestyle and aspirations of Australian families in the 1990s. Not surprisingly, poor urban design has produced a range of social problems in these estates. Ultimately, the social standards and habits of any community are a product of its built environment. This makes the task and urgency of urban renewal for public housing estates all the more critical. A number of recent reports and policy initiatives have placed the issues of public housing renewal and livability back on the national agenda, where they were placed in the 1970s by the actions of the Whitlam government with its urban renewal schemes, pioneered by Tom Uren, in Glebe and Woolloomooloo in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission, in its recent report on public housing, sensibly recommended a separation of the tenancy and property management functions of state housing authorities. The Minister for Housing and Regional Development, in the context of performance standards for the 1995 Commonwealth-state housing agreement now under negotiation, listed `formulating models to redevelop and reshape the stock, including financial options' as a key public housing issue. The September ALP national conference reconfirmed our platform commitment to provide specific additional federal funding to maintain and upgrade the public rental stock to acceptable community standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most importantly, the Defence Housing Authority and the better cities program in recent years have developed an outstanding cost-effective model for public housing renewal. Defence Housing Authority projects at Holsworthy in Sydney, adjoining my electorate, and Bullsbrook in Western Australia, along with better cities initiatives at Norlane near Geelong, east Preston in Melbourne, Inala in Brisbane, north Melbourne, Bunbury in Western Australia and the inspiring Elizabeth project in the electorate of my colleague the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) have collectively established a new national standard for the rejuvenation and regeneration of public housing stock in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At an average unit cost of just $12,000 to $15,000, these schemes skilfully apply all the best features of contemporary urban design and planning. For that reason, they have set up a very effective model that should be followed by all the state housing authorities and by this government. The features include facade improvements and fencing, streetscaping and landscaping work, traffic management techniques, better utilisation and design of open space areas and the creative use of infill development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those financial ministers and followers in the parliament, an encouraging portion of the work has been self-financing through the capacity for private sales and sensible infill development. Significantly, the suburb-wide treatment of homes and streets provides an additional boost to property value, which has been a liberating experience in financing. To regenerate the entire suburb provides an average unit boost to property values right across the project area. The public, parliament and each state housing authority should recognise the outstanding success of these demonstration projects, pioneered by the Defence Housing Authority and Minister Howe with the outstanding better cities initiative. They have substantially improved the built-in environment and quality of life in each area. Just as much, they have lifted the morale and lifestyle expectations of public housing tenants, helping to break down the old stereotypes and very unfortunate cycle of social problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefits of these schemes should not be left at the demonstration stage. They should be expanded throughout the nation for the remainder of the decade. They should be built into the conventional work of all state housing agencies. A new category of funding should be established under the next Commonwealth-state housing agreement to continue the progress made by this government with public housing renewal. Even more than that, the parliament and its executive have an opportunity to set a visionary target for public housing liveability in Australia: that is, a national target to bring the amenity and design standards of public housing estates across the nation to comparable private sector standards over the next 10 years or through the life of the next two Commonwealth-state housing agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this goal cannot be met without the allocation of further public sector resources, in terms of social benefits for low income Australians the government will find few more cost-effective outlays. My best estimate is of an additional outlay of $40 million to $50 million to the Commonwealth-state housing agreement for each year over the next decade: that is, a $400 million to $500 million program up to the year 2005. No federal initiative would more cost-effectively improve the quality of life and urban environment for a disadvantaged social group in Australia. Without better design and appearance, a sense of ownership and higher community expectations, existing social problems are almost impossible to solve. No initiative would more comprehensively fulfil federal responsibilities on the issue of urban design. No initiative would more substantially upgrade the quality of life, community spirit and image of housing estates in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, I note the interest of my colleague the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) on this issue, and I commend him for that interest. Public and rental housing is an important issue in my own electorate, and I believe that the demographics concerning my electorate of Stirling are quite similar to those of the member for Werriwa. Based on the 1991 census, 30.4 per cent of dwellings in my electorate were rented, whilst in Werriwa the figure was 29.6 per cent; the unemployment rate in Werriwa was 13.5 per cent versus 13.6 per cent in Stirling; we both had 23.2 per cent of the work force in our electorates working in the Public Service; and the median family income in Werriwa was $37,800 versus $32,851 in Stirling. My reason for quoting these figures is to show the similarity in the demographics of both our electorates and the fact that the issues of public housing and rental accommodation are important issues for both of us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Defence Housing Authority is a public housing authority for Defence Force personnel. The bill to establish the DHA ensured its funding by stipulating that not less than $750 million&mdash;and that is 1986 dollars&mdash;would be made available for capital expenditure on housing over the first decade of the authority's operations. When the Defence Housing Authority Bill 1987 was introduced into this place, the then Liberal member for McPherson, Peter White, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It gives me a certain amount of satisfaction to say that there is little disagreement over the general thrust of the Defence Housing Authority Bill and the setting up of the Defence Housing Authority, which obviously will be a major step in the right direction.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that the DHA has been successful in its operations, and the reasons for its setting up are being realised, that is, to provide quality housing for defence personnel. Prior to the establishment of the DHA, I guess the best way to describe the living conditions of many of the Defence Force personnel would be nothing short of horror stories. Many of my colleagues, both past and present and on both sides of the House, had anecdotal evidence of their own experiences in the defence forces and the conditions under which they were expected to live. These people were prepared to sacrifice their lives for our nation, yet they were expected to live in conditions which, in many instances, were worse than our prisons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for the establishment of a body such as the DHA was quite obvious and the coalition was, in principle, supportive of the government in establishing it. However, as was indicated when the bill was originally debated, we believed it did not go far enough. The DHA has seen major improvements in the quality and standards of housing for Defence Force personnel, and it would be hoped that these standards continue to improve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim of the better cities program is to promote an integrated approach to urban and regional planning. In Western Australia major projects involving Homeswest, our state's housing authority, have focused on urban renewal in Fremantle and East Perth. There has been some redevelopment of Homeswest property, but this has resulted in more productive use of land rather than the improvement of public housing estates. Homeswest has been improving its older housing estates by means of its estates improvement program and apartment strategy. The issue of large public housing estates is of much greater concern in the eastern states where there exist substantial asset management problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion also calls for a new category of funding under the next Commonwealth-state housing agreement, and it is here that my support for the member for Werriwa's motion goes decidedly cold. It runs counter to the current trend in Commonwealth and state funding arrangements for fewer specific purpose payments and more block grants. Any such payment, if it were to be based on need, would obviously favour the eastern states where the incidence of problem estates is greatest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission report into public housing noted that changes to the CSHA were needed. The CSHA has funded public housing since 1945, with annual expenditures on public housing in the order of $2.5 billion and public housing assets worth $31 billion. However, the Industry Commission report looked only at delivering public housing and rental assistance more efficiently and effectively and, unfortunately, did not go further and look at how to make home ownership easier. Owning one's home is still the great Australian dream. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems the focus of government attitudes towards housing has been to maintain ownership of the house and to rent it out. This, of course, is the responsibility of both state and federal governments&mdash;the federal governments providing funding, the states using those funds for housing. I will say at this point that I am not opposed to state housing authorities, nor to federal government funding of them. I do believe, however, that the agreements between state and Commonwealth governments concerning funding have been very unimaginative, non-progressive, and ignorant of the ambition of the people they are servicing&mdash;the aim to own their own home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Something I have been delighted about, therefore, is the initiative of Homeswest in my state of Western Australia to allow tenants to buy the homes in which they are living. They are able to get the homes cheaper than market value, with the discounts they receive depending on the length of time they have been renting their particular properties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably, with the limited time that we have this afternoon, we cannot canvass other options for assisting with home ownership, such as allowing people to use their super funds&mdash;a promise of the government at the last election, which it broke. It is one of the many promises that it broke. I conclude by saying that, while the member for Werriwa has legitimate concerns, they apply to his state and he should bring them up with his state housing authority and not impose his solutions for his state's problem on all the other states. In Western Australia's case, it would be taking a giant leap backwards. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, you would realise that during the summer months, coinciding with the school holidays, a large number of national junior sporting championships are held throughout Australia. Young people from around our large country are selected to represent their states and sporting associations in these national competitions. Their families, schools and sporting clubs are very proud of their achievements. For many of these young Australians this may be the beginning of a more accomplished sporting career&mdash;perhaps even ending up one day representing the country at the Olympics or Commonwealth Games. But for many Australian families the joy and pride of having their child chosen to compete in these national competitions is darkened by the realisation of the enormous costs involved and no more so than for those chosen to represent Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have come to witness first-hand the tremendous financial burdens some families are facing in having their children selected to participate in national championships&mdash;and some families have more than one child participating. For most families the cost of sending their children eastward to participate in a national competition exceeds $1,000 once travelling, accommodation and living expenses are taken into account. For families wanting to give their children the experience of national competition to reward them for their sporting success, this can represent a large financial outlay. I have asked the minister responsible to consider the creation of a national junior sporting subsidy program for those participants in junior championships living beyond 1,000 kilometres of the competition venue. This will enable some of the costs to be subsidised by the government. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a far cry from the government's position, which is basically that there is going to be a very large change in fiscal policy over the next couple of years coming from the changes in the 1993 budget to the tune of just on two per cent of GDP. We are already seeing that impact which is yet to be experienced by the real economy and fiscal policy. In that context, the government will be monitoring both the performance of the economy and the fiscal response.</PARA>

A family on $100,000 would pay about $7,500 a year less under income splitting, but many low income families would actually lose. Someone on, say, $20,000 would pay nearly $200 a year more in tax. As with everything with the member for Bennelong, it is back to the future.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3873" SPEAKER="Beazley The Hon K.C." NAMEID="PE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SWAN" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I have seen those proposals. They emanate largely from the opposition Treasury spokesman and are frequently contradicted by his leader and others in the portfolio. Every now and then around the place a journalist tries to get under the persiflage of the public comments of the Treasury spokesman on the subject of government deficit reduction targets to find out exactly what the opposition intends as its advocacy to the government as an alternative to raising taxes, cutting social welfare programs or whatever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every now and then a question gets asked of the opposition spokesman and he generally has to say that he has professional costings. We heard it first after the release of The Things That Matter. He said that it was professionally costed but that the opposition would be releasing that as time suited it. Laurie Oakes had a chance to chat to him on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program and we had another discussion about the fact that professional costings are available for them. When asked by Laurie Oakes whether he intended an advocacy of cutting into the social welfare programs and general education programs, or whatever, of the government&mdash;how much do you chop and where do you chop it from?&mdash;he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, plainly we've identified many areas&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the areas went to waste and duplication. The opposition spokesman on Treasury matters has persistently said&mdash;and said a couple of weeks earlier:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, no, no, we've made it clear that the areas that we are targeting are duplication, extravagance and waste.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are the targets of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He suggests the old dog portion of the firm Dodger &amp; Dog when invited to comment on where those areas would be. He is, of course, talking about billions of dollars against comments by his own finance spokesperson that as soon as he got the job as far as he was concerned the Public Service had been largely cleared up. At least the Leader of the Opposition has the honesty to say that something more would have to be done. Lyneham asked him:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But you're going to have to find much bigger savings than cutting out the waste and duplication, aren't you?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, yeah I accept that. Yeah, we will.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I mean billions of dollars worth of savings?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be some reductions&mdash;well, I'm not getting into figures&mdash;but there will be some reductions.</PARA>
<PARA>The opposition spokesman parades himself around the country in clear contradiction to his leader and in the total absence of any sensible consideration of the amounts entailed in the sorts of programs he is talking about. Nevertheless, he tells us that he has these figures he is not going to reveal. I wonder whether he has revealed them to his shadow spokesperson on finance matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow spokesperson on finance matters threw a deficit party about a month and a half ago in which he invited the front bench of the opposition to say what areas would be cut. He was chagrined to have to report to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> that he threw the deficit party but nobody came to play. Had he received submissions? No, he had not got any submissions on the subject of deficit cutting. He said, `You would not expect them to bring any submissions because, if they did, there might be some political consequences from it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition spokesperson, however, considered that one area of waste and duplication might be cut, and that is the administrative expenses in the education area of the Department of Employment, Education and Training. He identified a potential cut of $160 million in this area. It was quite reasonably pointed out to him by Laurie Oakes that this was not a particularly big number in the context of the sorts of sums he was talking about. Nevertheless, $160 million is $160 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had a chance to have a look at that $160 million worth of expenses which were identified as alleged costs of administering the Commonwealth's contribution to the schools program related to the states and, therefore, as duplication because the states do that. We have checked through the figures. The precise amount that is entailed in administering a program&mdash;the state component of which is $1 1/2 billion and the private schools component of which is also $1 1/2 billion&mdash;is $4.3 million. The cost is $4.3 million. So that is the area of duplication and waste he has identified thus far for billions of dollars worth of changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear now that there are two propositions that opposition members have to consider, as they continually approach us and lecture us as they have here in question time, and they are these: either they are concealing&mdash;and they are not really concealing because they have done no work, contrary to what the shadow Treasury spokesperson says&mdash;an intention for massive cuts in programs that are fundamental to equity in this nation or, because they have opposed any suggestion of increases in existing taxes, they do have an agenda to introduce what they, particularly the Leader of the Opposition, deeply believed in, and that was a goods and services tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was no surprise to me the other day to find the Leader of the Opposition saying that, if the opposition were elected, it would not introduce a goods and services tax in the life of the parliament subsequent to the election. Everybody knows that it would take two or three years to get it up. It would be a pretty simple matter to put it in place during the life of the next parliament and to implement it the year after. It is what opposition members dearly believe in and, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, we must now assume that to be their intention for deficit reduction.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very interesting that the member for Bennelong should be saying something about this. In a few minutes I will come to what he had to say about the airport. It must be understood that, from the period of the opening of the third runway in November until the commissioning of the new control tower and radar facilities in early 1995, there would be a period of transition and that it was always going to be difficult. New operational procedures have to be worked out and approach and take-off paths have to be refined. However, there must be a transitional period of some months while the new procedures at the airport are bedded down.

Can she outline the progress in implementing this program to date?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3879" SPEAKER="Lawrence The Hon C.M." NAMEID="XS4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="FREMANTLE" MINISTERIAL="HUMAN SERVICES AND HEALTH" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XS4">Dr LAWRENCE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for the question. Under the current fee for service arrangements, as members would be aware, it is quite clear that we do not always reward quality care appropriately. Instead, unfortunately, sometimes it is high volume, frequent visits and high turnover that are rewarded. What we have tried to do with the better practice program is to ensure that the old fashioned GP style has more reward. It rewards continuity of care, after hours and institutional visits by doctors, ensures the maintenance of their qualifications to a high level and, very importantly, there is a rural loading of some 20 per cent, so it pays directly into rural general practices which typically maintain continuity of care as well amounts ranging from $8,000 to $12,000 or $13,000, depending on the size of the practice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fair to say that, when this proposal was announced, there was mixed reaction from the profession&mdash;from some fairly intemperate opposition to cautious support. We have been discussing with the various bodies representing the medical profession over a number of years the best ways to provide these additional payments to general practice to reward quality care. We had detailed discussions with the representative bodies in October this year and their views were taken into account in the final consideration. Nonetheless, of the bodies the AMA did remain opposed and has suggested to its members that they should not cooperate in applying for and receiving these better practice grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that, again, the general practitioners' own good senses dictated that they are actually taking part in this program. We have had to date some 5,124 requests from general practices for information and application kits. That represents, for the interest of members, some 16,663 general practitioners, or two-thirds of the profession, who have already shown an interest in this very important program. What it does is say to general practitioners, `If you are prepared to do after hours work, follow up your patients, attend to them in nursing homes, then you will be appropriately rewarded.' It is a different type of service that is being rewarded. It is not, as the AMA fears, an attempt to remove fee for service but simply to add to it and improve the way the practitioners operate.</PARA>

Given that the l-a-w turned into an Oscar winning act of deceit and those income tax cuts will not be delivered in 1996, do you still stand by the principle that tax cuts should be delivered first to middle and higher income earners, as was proposed in One Nation?

Contrary to claims from some quarters, particularly the opposition, this is not a measure that the IYF council even suggested would be of benefit to single income families. In fact, it will direct no more assistance to single income families since these families already receive $30 a week by way of the home child-care allowance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for McMillan for his question. I will mention briefly the comments of two people who represent different interests and who certainly have an interest in and view about regional Australia. When speaking of regional development, Sir Donald Eckersley, the Chairman of the South West Development Authority and inaugural chairman of the National Farmers Federation, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's approach heralded a new era in regional development in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The convenor of the regional Australia Now campaign wrote to me this week and described the government's efforts in regional development as the most significant outcome for regions since federation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Thursday of last week I announced in Warrnambool the formation of a green triangle region in western Victoria and the eastern part of South Australia, and the Prime Minister announced a region in Illawarra. The region in western Victoria has extremely strong support. That support includes both the South Australian and Victorian governments, a large number of local councils, local business as well as rural leaders. The reason is that, in the approach to regional development, we have sought to consult very widely. I say a word of congratulations to those involved, particularly to Deakin University and the role played by Gordon Forth in encouraging the widest possible consultations and in encouraging a consensus for the development of that so-called green triangle region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The green triangle region will allow for the development of a strong regional development organisation and a mobilisation of the economic resources in that region, which are considerable. It will mean that the population there of a little less than a quarter of a million will, through that regional development organisation, be able to build on the very considerable resource base&mdash;whether it is the wool industry, the port or the forestry resources that exist in that area. There is considerable potential for the tourism industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over and against the government's approach, which is to consult widely&mdash;it is very much a bottom-up approach and an attempt to develop regions that have got some economic significance and value&mdash;the opposition, particularly the Leader of the Opposition, suggests that somehow the government's approach is not bottom up and that somehow the approach is one that is imposing an approach from Canberra. Clearly, we are working in partnership with these regions in regional development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the next few months we will see a further series of regional development organisations announced. They will all be broadly based, they will represent different but significant economic regions in Australia, they will be supported by local government and they will be supported by the activists and the leaders in those areas. Our approach coming out of Working Nation is considered and policy based.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen reports on this. The reality is that in good economic times separations from the ADF increase, and that is what we are seeing now. Added to this we are seeing societal change, which I am sure will manifest itself on all of us in here at one stage or another&mdash;people do not stay in the one job all their lives; they are interested in changing jobs some three to four times during their career. These trends mean that we have to be, in terms of the ADF, ahead of the game and prepared for events such as the increased separations so that we do not suffer holes further down the track in our needs for personnel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When shortfalls do occur in the broad numbers in the ADF, this does not necessarily translate into an immediate reduction in overall ADF operational capabilities or preparedness. Capabilities are covered by ensuring that staffing in essential operational areas is always maintained at appropriate levels; in other words, people are moved over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ADF is, I believe, positioning itself ahead of the game on these issues and both long-term and short-term strategies have been put in place on these matters. I am pleased to be able to inform the honourable member that the Vice Chief of the Defence Force has confirmed with me today an additional $2.04 million for the recruiting advertising budget for triservice advertising, with an amount for both navy and ADFA advertising.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is in addition to specific area targeting such as the navy, where we are increasing the proportional intake of women, relaxing the minimum entry age for most areas and giving more discretion to recruiting officers in assessing individual applications. The air force has put in a number of strategies to cope with the outflow of air traffic controllers and pilots such as occurred in previous times and which we expect may increase next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I think it is important to note that the air force is not, contrary to some beliefs, experiencing operational restrictions due to staffing or recruitment shortfalls. I am pleased to inform the honourable member that the RAAF&mdash;she has a big interest in the RAAF, with Richmond in her electorate&mdash;has increased substantially its training pipelines for both air traffic controllers and pilots in expectation of any potential poaching campaign from civilian organisations. For instance, the training pipeline for air traffic controllers has been boosted from 18 to 40 in the current year, with 44 planned for 1995-96. Pilot training has increased from 45 to 55 per year. In addition, the air force is&mdash;at my request&mdash;looking at options for lateral recruitment from overseas of both pilots and air traffic controllers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of recruiting for future needs, we are currently conducting one of the largest ever recruiting campaign drives. Some 7,000 people in both the permanent and ready reserve forces are to be recruited over the next year. The floodgates on recruiting are open.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, this is in addition to our long-term targeted campaigns&mdash;the special packages and campaigns targeted at those in school years seven to 10 to increase that pool of people who potentially could consider a career in the ADF. In further pursuit of the long-term strategy for our recruitment, we are looking at Defence Force recruiting by way of review by an external consultant. The first phase of that will go to the chiefs of staff on Wednesday and I will be looking at some of the results of that with General Baker on Thursday. In short, I can assure the honourable member that the ADF is being pro-active on this issue. We are, as I say, opening the floodgates for recruitment to good jobs, jobs with excellent training that will stand young people in good stead for the rest of their lives.</PARA>

I refer the Prime Minister to his defence of this remark to the effect that he also spoke of maintaining the tax to GDP ratios as the way he would extricate himself from this commitment. Is the Prime Minister aware that, according to the budget papers, tax revenue as a percentage of GDP has actually increased from 1992-93 to 1994-95 and, therefore, he has by any standard increased taxes and breached that commitment to the electorate?

You were the high tax, high spending party. When I became Treasurer, the top marginal tax rate was 60 per cent. The company rate was 46 per cent and the government was double-taxing dividends.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The petition of the undersigned residents and citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thousands of residents around Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport have been suffering many years of excessive noise levels classified as "unacceptable" by Australian Standards AS2021. As the community was established well before the airport, the intrusion of noise and pollution from aircraft operations represents a cost borne by the community. This cost has still not been repaid, and yet the Government is intending to further impose on the community north of the airport by transferring air traffic from the east-west to the north-south runway. Many people already seriously affected by present noise levels would become critically affected by such an increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Your petitioners object in principle to any noise increase for communities where the noise limits recommended by Australian Standards have already been exceeded by the encroachment of federal airport operations.</PARA>

The Draft Plan estimates that the implementation of what little it has to offer would take up to ten years. Meanwhile, the Government's redistribution of air traffic is planned for October 1st 1994. The affected community cannot be expected to shoulder such a heavy, unfair and unnecessary burden of increased noise with no measures in place to compensate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia will:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today, in the House, question time was more active than it is normally on a Monday sitting day. I rise to speak in the grievance debate to cover three areas which I believe many people in Australia&mdash;certainly in my electorate of Braddon in north-west Tasmania&mdash;are deeply concerned about. Those three issues are unemployment, interest rates and taxes. Today's vigorous interchange at question time came about because we got on to the hard issues that are concerning people. Obviously, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is a little tetchy about the fact that these are the issues which are running out there in the Australian electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at unemployment. The Prime Minister desires to go back into history and quote what happened under other governments, particularly the Fraser government. This government under the present Prime Minister has never had as low an unemployment rate as Fraser's maximum rate. Under Fraser there were 624,700 people out of work at the highest time, at the peak. In Australia now there are over 800,000 people out of work. In this country we have a government which created over one million unemployed people at one stage. It now tries to make a virtue out of the policies which are supposedly bringing down unemployment when in actual fact people are being taken out of unemployment and put into training programs and schemes for jobs for which there are already 100 or 200 people with qualifications who are already unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has this notion that it is able to address unemployment, but out in the real world, particularly in regional Australia, which this government has ignored for 10 years, there are many people grappling to come to terms with not having a job. There are so many figures indicating the numbers of families which do not have an income earner; over 600,000 children live in homes in which there is no wage or income earner. That is a great tragedy for this country. It is time this government came to grips with changing its economic policy so that businesses and the people who create the real jobs in this country can get under way, be competitive internationally and be able to sell products overseas and so that we can create jobs in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I want to raise, which is a burning issue for many people out there at this point, is interest rates. We all know that in 1990-91 we had interest rates in housing and in small business of 16, 18 and 22 per cent. They came down, and now we see them going up. Many people have gone into a housing market in the last couple of years because they were hopeful that inflation and interest rates would stay down. The government gave all the indications, and there are plenty of quotes around that say, `We will keep inflation down and we are going to pass on the benefits to the Australian people.' Yet we now see the boom-bust cycle, which we have had under this government for over a decade, coming back into full swing with a vengeance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are going to find hundreds of people, particularly young married couples, caught out with interest rates going up on their housing loans. An $80,000 loan will go up $40 a month and $150,000 loans will go up $125 a month if interest rates go up by one per cent. There is every indication that interest rates are going to go up before Christmas&mdash;a time when people desire to have some financial capacity to spend on gifts for their children and for presents for others. This government put economic policies into place in the last budget when it was warned by organisation after organisation and by the opposition of the need to control its spending. It said, `No, it's all right, it's no problem,' yet within six months we have seen the economy running out of control. The people who are going to pay for it will be ordinary average Australians. Instead of this government getting its policies correct and in order, it is going to wham on interest rates to try to dampen down the economy. Instead of this government getting its policies and its programs in control&mdash;it does not want to take the electoral burden of having to cut its budget&mdash;it is going to force Australian people to pay out of their pockets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I grieve here today for the people in my electorate. This is a callous government. Today we saw the Prime Minister hypocritically come in here with all the rhetoric under the sun, yet he has no understanding of the ordinary Australians who are faced with this increase in interest rates. To top it all off, we now have the government saying, `We are going to put up taxes.' I go back to the first quote referred to today in the parliament when the Prime Minister was talking about tax cuts in which he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . let me tell you something that I thought you might have known&mdash;they've been legislated. They were not a promise, they are law&mdash;L-A-W&mdash;law.</PARA>
<PARA>We all know the quote l-a-w law. What it should have really been was l-i-e lie. That is what he should have told the Australian people before the last election. Yet we had the Prime Minister coming in here today backing off, indicating that he never said anything like this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government was re-elected on the promise of tax cuts, yet what have we seen in every paper over the last two or three days? We have seen the government indicating that it is going to put up taxes. On <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> on 19 November 1993, just over a year ago and just under 19 months after being elected, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What I am promising is not to put up tax.</PARA>
<PARA>That was his promise as Prime Minister just over a year ago, and we now find the economy running out of control. The budget was brought in in May this year, off target, and now he is going to ask the Australian people to pay for the government's mistakes. It is going to be the ordinary workers out there, the people in the factories, the farmers and the people in small businesses who are going to pay for the mismanagement of this economy by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What have we heard from the Treasurer (Mr Willis) over the last few days, remembering the quote from the Prime Minister&mdash;`I promise I am not going to put up taxes'&mdash;just a year ago? On 26 October 1994 in a press release entitled `Doorstop: September quarter CPI' on the need to increase taxes the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, I don't think that that is so . . . Now if you are going to put all of that together you are talking about very, very large cuts in the public sector. We are not talking in those terms, we are not talking about that kind of approach.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet on 1 December, just a few days ago, on interest rate rises, we find the Treasurer saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But certainly we have to assess whether anything more needs to be done and that is what we will do in the fullness of time. We will make that thorough examination and decide what the appropriate strategy is.</PARA>
<PARA>All the time we find the government backing away from its commitments either by putting up interest rates or by putting up taxes. Instead of cutting taxes, the code words are out there already&mdash;`Taxes are going up.' Read the Prime Minister's lips, read the Treasurer's lips: they are going to go up. Interest rates are going to go up, taxes are going up and it is the ordinary Australians who are going to pay for the mismanagement of this government. </PARA>

Over the last 12 months, members of the coalition representing the people of Victoria have expressed their concern in this House on a variety of issues with one simple theme: the attack upon states rights and the power of the Commonwealth in respect of those rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned about the rights of the people of Victoria. I refer now to recent legislation which has just proceeded through the Victorian Legislative Assembly. The government of the day has virtually abandoned its responsibility in the critical area of health care in the management of nursing homes by introducing and passing legislation which basically abandons frail, older Victorians living in nursing homes and hostels. The legislation basically removes all state government responsibility for regulating nursing homes and hostels. Part of that is a requirement that poses no obligation on any manager of a nursing home to employ a fully qualified nurse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know how members opposite feel, but the people who inhabit nursing homes in Australia are the generation that came through two world wars and the depression, reared their families and produced good Australians. When they reach the point of frailty, they are entitled to expect that if they go into a nursing home proper standards will be complied with. If the state government of Victoria does not want to apply those standards, in terms of much of the funding coming from the Commonwealth, if it does not want to exercise its obligations to care for the frail aged, then it ought to come out honestly and say so. It ought to say to the Commonwealth, `We don't want to discharge this responsibility. We are going to abandon it. Please take it over.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sick of hearing members of the coalition continually bleating in this place about the erosion of what they call states rights when not one of them would get up in this House and say that they would be prepared to put their aged parent into a nursing home that had no qualified nurse and no requirement from a Victorian conservative, reactionary government to ensure that the rights of patients are properly protected. The government has no capacity at all to stop somebody who is running a guest house or some kind of hostel to advertise it as a nursing home. Those sorts of standards are unacceptable and they should not be accepted by the Commonwealth. If the government of Victoria does not want to exercise its responsibilities in this area, let it say so and let it abandon the field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area of concern to me is in respect of matters within my own electorate. Last week I received a phone call asking me to go down to Albert Park to see what was an orderly demonstration by citizens not merely from within my electorate but from all over Melbourne. They were protesting about the Grand Prix taking place in a people's park. They are not opposed to the Grand Prix as such. There have been reasonable alternative suggestions made as to where else it could take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I got there at about 9.30 a.m., many of the younger people had gone about their business, gone off to carry out their responsibilities as employers, managers or executives. Basically the people who were there were retired or housewives or elderly people. While they were there, a fence was put up around a fairly large section of the park. I was staggered to see some hour after I had arrived a series of police vans pull up and emerging from them, marching almost four abreast, were endless hoards of police. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They were subsequently followed by police officers on mounted horses. The horses had shields over their faces and the riders had long riot batons hanging on the saddle. I do not know whether they were to control the horse or to control these demonstrators, the most orderly bunch of people I have ever seen. They had the most amicable relationships with the police on all of the occasions they exercised their fundamental right to protest. There was no suggestion at any stage of non-cooperation with the police. There had been no suggestion of any violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a time when there are serious problems with law enforcement and crime in Victoria, here were all these police with horses, paddy wagons&mdash;the full bit&mdash;and valuable police time being spent doing what? It was not their fault. What a rotten job for a law enforcement officer. On a guesstimate, I would say there were 2 1/2 policemen to every elderly person and some of the younger people there. Some of them had elected, as a matter of principle, to volunteer to be arrested in order to maintain their protest. I would have suggested that half a dozen to a dozen policemen could have carried out this process instead of this incredible exercise in law and order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think that is what my state is about and I do not think that is what my community is about. Many people were there because they believe a park is something which belongs to all the people. Many of the elderly people were there to ensure that right for their grandchildren. It is ironic that some years ago, in 1958 to be exact, the then Bolte government took all races out of the park. There was a proposal to have not a formula one race but a fairly moderate form of motor racing. The government of the day said no, parks were for people, not for motor racing. That was a decision by one of the strongest, and I might say one of the ablest, Liberal leaders this nation has produced and it was loudly applauded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun</EMPHASIS> of 6 November 1958 stated that the people should have full, free and safe access to their parks at all times. It is pity that there seems to have been a change of management at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun</EMPHASIS> because that is not what it is saying now. I would have thought that, if that were the principle that provoked editorial columns then, the same principle should apply now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I grieve for my state when I see law-abiding citizens being confronted by overwhelming numbers of police officers with paddy wagons when they were trying to exercise a democratic concern about the future of public property, a public park. This is not what good government is about. This is not what I believe is in the best interests of the state of Victoria and certainly not in the best interests of those people who believe that parks belong to people. I condemn the abuse of precious police time and resources. I condemn the government of Victoria for its approach to all of these matters. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I grieve for many young Australians&mdash;many who fidget, are irritable, overactive, have poor listening skills, are impulsive, break things and are interruptive. I also grieve for those children who may appear lazy, listless or forgetful, who sometimes can sit for long periods without movement and who are generally considered to be quiet children. I grieve for those children who might at times say, `Mummy, I wish I was dead. Mummy, nothing goes right for me. Stop yelling at me, I'll remember in a minute.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I grieve for the Australian children and, in some cases, the adults who suffer from ADD, commonly called attention deficit disorder. Attention deficit disorder is a diagnostic label which is used to describe a significant group of children who have experienced learning and temperament problems. The label changes over the years and has done for many years, yet the weaknesses and behaviour of these children remain constant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my view that the community should acknowledge the condition of attention deficit disorder and begin to prioritise planning for the improved management of the condition. The core characteristics of this disorder include inattention, impulsiveness and hyperactivity, which are exhibited by most children some of the time to some degree. The distinguishing feature of ADD children is the magnitude of the symptoms most of the time in most situations. ADD children are not necessarily of below average intelligence&mdash;quite the contrary&mdash;with some evidence indicating that the majority of children with the condition have average or well above average intelligence. It seems that the great tragedy for some of the children with ADD is that they may be doubly disabled by not only having the condition but also being gifted. This creates a novel concept: the gifted disabled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia ADD children are included with all children with learning disabilities and are therefore not helped by current programs. ADD kids have behavioural problems which can lead to petty crime, drug abuse, motor vehicle offences, violence, and often gaol. Many may suicide. With the very high rate of suicide for under 25-year-old males in Australia the highest in the world, it would appear that we should address this issue and its relationship to ADD children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ADD sufferers may leave school early because of their learning disability, which may be undiagnosed, and therefore they are denied participation in further learning experiences. They may take jobs beneath their potential, which may make them bitter with their life and with the community. They may, in fact, get into trouble with the police. Current correctional programs do not address diagnosis of ADD; therefore, their continued offending may be contributing to their condition. There is strong evidence of chronic alcoholism and drug abuse amongst ADD sufferers. There is also evidence of work absenteeism. Based on this evidence, we as a community would do well to address the needs of ADD children and the social problems they, their families and the community all suffer through lack of attention to the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is this thing called attention deficit disorder? ADD is misunderstood by many. It is not a behavioural problem, but it is a behavioural expression of a problem defined in different ways. It is a neurobiological disorder or imbalance. The incidence rate is not clear because of the continued lack of clear and accurate data. However, depending on the source of information, the disorder affects between five and 20 per cent of the child population. That basically means that 3.4 million Australians suffer or have suffered from attention deficit disorder. Surely that is a statistic that should be of concern to all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ADD is more common in boys than in girls. Recent studies suggest that girls are less identified because they exhibit fewer aggressive hyperactive characteristics and do not come to the attention of teachers. It has been thought that, by the age of puberty, children grow out of the condition. However, the most recent evidence shows that ADD may be a life disorder, with many children learning to control their problems during their teen years. For about 50 to 70 per cent of children with ADD, some of the problems will continue into adulthood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How does this condition happen? It is clear from research that ADD happens through immaturity of the brain chemistry in some affected areas of the brain so the brain is not effective. Treatment with drug therapy is at once the most controversial and also the most successful form of management for children and adults with ADD problems. Ritalin, for instance, increases the level of the neurotransmitter substances in the gap between the nerve cells, acting as a neurotransmitter. It is eliminated from the system within four hours and is non-addictive, which is contrary to recent publicity. All but a small percentage of children and adults with ADD respond to medication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is that children with learning difficulties and learning disabilities are still not formally recognised in the education or disability fields. What can we do about this? Education and support services must be directed at those in need of education and support and not on a category based determinant. A decision must be made to recognise specific learning difficulties, learning difficulties and learning disabilities, and a definition of these three must be made and accepted within the education, medicine and disability fields. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Teachers must be given some recognition for the advanced skills they obtain in the area of learning difficulties and should be recognised as specialist teachers. Provision should be made for a specialist resource person from existing staff at each school to act as a resource for all staff in catering for students with learning difficulties and disabilities. More specific and detailed attention must be obtained from the field to encompass all the solutions for these children. The above items are essential prerequisites for services for and recognition of the associated problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that my short address contributes to raising concerns about ADD, attention deficit disorder, within the wider community and raises public awareness and debate. I foreshadow that I will be presenting a motion to the parliament this week and, hopefully, I will get it on the agenda for discussion next year. I think this is an important issue. With an average of 15 per cent of the population suffering from ADD, we cannot continue to ignore this particular condition. We should at least address it in some way but specifically through education and awareness. Mr Deputy Speaker, I assure you and the honourable members in the chamber that I shall continue to raise this issue in the parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have great delight in reporting to the House a successful initiative by this parliament. an initiative relating to the scrutiny of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. About three years ago the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade&mdash;of which the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney), at the table, was the distinguished chair before he became a minister&mdash;took on an inquiry into the bank and the fund, considering that they needed additional scrutiny and that they were inadequately studied by parliaments. We undertook an inquiry that lasted about 18 months and which was quite extensive in its coverage. One of our recommendations in the report that was tabled about 15 months ago was that there should be an international parliamentary assembly to monitor and scrutinise what the bank and fund are doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present position is that the bank and fund are unable, or regard themselves as unable, to appear before parliamentary committees because, they say, they relate to governments and that, if they appeared before parliamentary committees, that might compromise them in some way. But one way around that problem, it seemed to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, would be to hold an international parliamentary assembly and then get the bank and the fund to appear. So the Speaker of this House and the President of the Senate wrote to the speaker of the US House of Representatives and the Senate majority leader proposing that an international parliamentary assembly be held to which the parliamentarians from each of the countries at present providing the executive directors of the bank and the fund would be invited and at which the fund and the bank would be invited to appear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This suggestion was taken up by the US House Banking Committee. It organised a hearing which was held in Washington, in the banking committee room, on 21 November. I represented Australia. Parliamentarians from 18 countries attended. The seminar was chaired by representative Barney Frank, who chairs the House Subcommittee on International Development, Finance, Trade and Monetary Policy. The chief economists from each of the bank and the fund appeared and made statements, and then we asked them questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, we were assisted by an eminent panel of four advisers who themselves made statements commenting on the work of the bank and the fund. This was really a major breakthrough because it was the first time in the 50-year history of the bank and the fund that they have appeared officially and formally before a parliamentary committee. The parliamentarians taking part asked them questions. Several themes were taken up by a lot of parliamentarians; others were taken up by only one or two. The main themes were accountability, transparency and a critique of the fund and bank policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to transparency, it was pointed out by Geoffrey Sachs, a very eminent Harvard professor, that the fund is a more secretive organisation than the CIA. The CIA releases its records after 50 years; the IMF never releases its records of its relationship between itself and governments. It regards them as so secret that they are never made available for study. That means that the wider public has no way of knowing what the fund is saying to countries as a result of its annual visits. Since those annual visits are undoubtedly influential in the development of economic policy in member countries, this really is a very unsatisfactory situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of parliaments are very keen to have those articles for consultations made public. There is a willingness to do that to a degree within the fund but the fund is concerned that, if all its advice were made public, its effectiveness would be reduced. There is some room for debate there, but it is very important that, as with the OECD which makes public its advice to governments, the fund's advice should also be made public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to recognise that there is a habitual bias in the advice the fund gives. The fund is preoccupied with reducing and controlling inflation. It has very little concern with the level of economic activity, with the rate of economic development, with the level of unemployment or with the rate of employment growth, let alone with issues like equity or the reduction of poverty. That means that the advice it gives is skewed. Cumulatively, the advice it gives globally has a deflationary effect on the global economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fund, by its preoccupation with inflation, is always arguing for reductions in the level of economic activity. It commonly appears to recommend increases in interest rates, which has the effect of slowing economic activity, so slowing the growth of employment and maintaining unemployment at a higher level than would otherwise occur. When that is happening in a whole series of countries at the same time, there is a mutually reinforcing deflationary impact on the global economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, the fund is asymmetrical. It argues with current account deficit countries that they should contract activity but does not effectively advocate expansion of activity in current account surplus countries. Again, for that reason, it has a deflationary impact. So its advice is severely skewed. As well, the bank is much criticised for the inadequacy and misjudgments of its structural adjustment advice to countries. I do not have time to go into that in detail. I have talked about that in the House before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those kinds of issues were raised by parliamentarians. This assembly will become an annual event. There was complete agreement that it was valuable and that it should be held again. The US congressional chair offered to organise it again next year. I expect that it will, therefore, become one more lever for scrutinising and monitoring what the bank and the fund are doing, and in so doing increasing their accountability to the wider community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is not only a growing awareness of their   influence but also a growing concern about the orientation of their policies. It is, therefore, very important that their accountability to the wider global population be increased through their accountability to parliaments. This assembly will contribute to that effect. </PARA>

It consolidates for the first time all material leading up to and including the introduction of the child support scheme. It provides a rigorous and critical analysis of the scheme. The report has broken new ground in opening up the parliamentary committee system to ordinary people, allowing them to express their opinions and views and to have them taken into account by a group of parliamentarians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee received 6,197 submissions&mdash;a record. It is history now that the hotline established by the committee received over 150,000 calls in two days. I tabled in the House an interim report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Thanks for listening</EMPHASIS>. As the committee moved around Australia hearing witnesses, it invited members of the audience&mdash;that is, the public&mdash;to make short statements to the committee. Many did so. This participative approach and the overwhelming public response were the core input to this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has listened and developed a powerful reform package consisting of some 163 recommendations for change. These changes aim to strengthen the scheme&mdash;not weaken it. The recommendations involve a major shake-up of the  administration and seek to restore the balance of power between clients of the scheme and the agency. Administrative procedure must not override the rights of clients under legislation. The CSA must become more effective and, at a very basic level, be capable of responding and acting upon telephone calls and letters. The CSA must become a client focused and a client sensitive organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parents need to be cloaked with rights when dealing with the agency and with the ability and opportunity to seek redress when these rights are abrogated. When the agency fails, clients should be compensated for their financial losses. There are proposed modifications to the formula&mdash;the minimum necessary to restore equity in the scheme. These recommendations are a blueprint for reform. They chart the way ahead. These recommendations make up a finely balanced package that does not lend itself readily to the government cherry picking its way through recommendations. The committee believes that more research needs to be undertaken and that there ought to be further evaluations of the scheme and appropriate finetuning over time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Has the child support scheme been a success? Yes, it has been a qualified success. The community now accepts that parents should and must be responsible for their children. Much has been made of the 75 per cent collection rate&mdash;a world best. In fact, it appears to represent somewhat of a sleight of hand. Firstly, default assessments of over 202 million are excluded and private collection is included. Consequently, the agency collection rate is closer to 42 per cent than 75 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are competing objectives of the scheme and they are not prioritised. They need to be prioritised to provide greater accountability and transparency in the scheme. In practice, the scheme appears to be more about saving government revenue than about adequate support for children. The following order of priorities of objectives, with one multiplication and one addition to the scheme, has been recommended. Adequate support is available for all children not living with both parents. Parents share in the costs of supporting their children according to their respective capacities to pay. Commonwealth expenditure is limited to the minimum necessary to ensure that child support to all children not living with both parents is adequate and that work incentives for both parents to participate in the labour force are not impaired. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The administration of the Child Support Agency was  almost doomed from the start. Whilst a huge effort went into developing the policy and legislation underpinning the scheme, little effort went into the administration and operation of the scheme. What little chance they had was snuffed out by the exponential growth of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agency's case load has grown from 23,000 to 275,218 in May 1994. It is increasing at the rate of about 7,000 per month. The ombudsman has been consistently critical since the 1989-90 report. The issues of concern included lost documents, delays in registering agreements and court orders, delays in all stages of the process of the recovery of arrears, delays in arranging for auto-withholding of wages, delays in recording and acknowledging payments, inadequate telephone service, failure to answer correspondence and return telephone calls, inability to provide full and accurate information, miscalculation of arrears, inaccurate advice concerning arrears, inappropriate recovery action and failure to take remedial action after proper notification of mistakes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I still do not understand why the ombudsman's reports have not been heeded and acted upon. It is the clients of the agency who have suffered and endured. There was a hopelessly inadequate central structure and administration. Branch offices were little more than freewheeling fiefdoms. The officers were swamped with work and the systems designed to deal with it created and added to the workload. I am pleased to say that with the appointment of Moira Scollay in charge of the agency reform and change has begun. The committee welcomes and applauds these changes that have started since the inquiry was first announced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of most concern, however, is the powerlessness of the clients dealing with the CSA and the inability of clients of the agency to effect any form of redress. For this reason, the committee has recommended a radical package including the provision of dedicated case officers with responsibility and accountability for each client, development of a code of conduct, development of appropriate service standards, provision for clients to escalate their concerns to higher level management, provision of effective staff training, development of national guidelines, recruitment of staff with appropriate service and client skills, use of easily understood correspondence, improvement of the telephone service for clients, avoiding the use of inappropriate computer generated correspondence and ensuring administrative practice is consistent with legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the main reasons for locating the agency in the Australian Taxation Office was to use the collection and enforcement skills within the ATO. There is little evidence that the agency or the ATO has been successful. By any standards, $481 million of debt is mammoth. If the CSA were a private company it would risk bankruptcy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agency released its national compliance policy only in June this year. The CSA has little idea of the make-up, age and profile of its debt. Its enforcement practices have been described as woeful and its use of court proceedings has been described as cumbersome. This area has not had consistent staffing, nor has the agency consistently used the powers available to it. The solution is not merely to throw in more staffing resources but rather an effective and efficient use of existing powers the agency already has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Included in the committee's recommendations are that the CSA must consistently use its power under section 120 of the act to force NCPs who are more than three months in arrears to provide full details of their assets and income, the CSA be allowed to report defaulting NCPs to credit reference bureaus, the CSA be allowed to change the family law to allow the parties to a child support enforcement proceeding to be identified where an order has been made, the CSA to report within six months on the costs and benefits of using private process services, the CSA to pilot the use of private collection agencies, the Department of Finance to base its costing of additional staff in the enforcement area on the amount of child support collected rather than the amount of money the Department of Social Security saves and the CSA to report in the next 12 months on any additional power it may require to improve enforcement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There appears to be a loophole for those who are self-employed or receive a salary package and/or investment income. The CSA was unable to quantify the problem. No group in society should be allowed to avoid or evade its responsibilities to its children. It is like a cancer undermining the scheme. Accordingly, the committee has recommended some tough measures to deal with the problem, including adding fringe benefits back into the child support income base, limiting superannuation contributions to a maximum of nine per cent of income, a targeted program of auditing CSA clients with business and/or investment income, random audits of non-salary and wage earners, allowing the CSA to vary an assessment where the parent has a greater capacity to pay and backdating the assessment for four years, allowing assessments to be backdated up to seven years where parents fail to fully disclose all income, expenditure and assets, deeming income on non-income producing assets and deeming income from an asset where the ownership has been transferred to minimise child support liability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some may argue that these provisions are draconian, and they may be. The committee was keen to ensure that the level of voluntary compliance by parents and their advisers would be significant. There should be no reward for those who wish to devise schemes for minimising child support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of the Child Support Review Office in July 1962 was a welcome reform to the system. Its function is limited to dealing with departure applications and it has no power to deal with any other administrative decisions made by the CSA. A number of problems have been identified such as the CSRO does not perform a proper external review, rather it makes original decisions, the CSRO does not publish its decisions, there is no guarantee of consistency of CSRO decisions and clients of the CSRO are unable to reasonably predict their chance of a successful appeal. The committee has recommended that a proper external review office be created called the Child Support Appeals Office to review all administrative decisions of the agency. The agency must also institute an appropriate internal review mechanism that allows the agency a first-in opportunity to fix up its own mistakes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No government can continue to fund the increasing expansion of the agency. What is required is not incremental change but a radical rethink about the agency's role and focus. The CSA is involved in too many cases. There must be strong encouragement for parents to make sensible, mutually beneficial private arrangements about their responsibilities for their children, freed from government intervention. For those parents who have in the past or will in the future require the intervention of the CSA, that intervention should only persist until a stable pattern of child support payments has been established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some 56 per cent of CSA clients pay their child support on time either through auto-withholding or voluntarily paying the agency. These parents should be allowed to opt out of the scheme into private collection arrangements. The CSA must have a new role of advising parents of their rights and obligations under the scheme and facilitating private collection arrangements. This will require an up-front investment of time, but it is also about securing and anchoring a longer term responsibility for child support until the child or children turn 18. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, the core role of the agency should be advising parents of their rights and obligations under the scheme, facilitating private collection arrangements, handling those cases where such arrangements are not possible or break down and pursuing those non-custodial parents who refuse to pay. Over time this will shrink the cost of the agency and shrink the size of the agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CSA needs to dramatically change the way it deals with non-custodial parents, especially their first contact. There is an average delay of 142 days between the start date of liability and the day upon which DSS pays the custodial parent the first child support payment. In addition, an average of 65 days of arrears accumulates before the NCPs are first informed of the amount of their liability. If there is an administrative delay the period of arrears is greater. The committee proposes to halve the delay to 79 days and eliminate the initial build-up of arrears. This dramatic change will help everyone. Custodial parents will receive their first child support payment 63 days earlier and more reliably. The NCP will not start off on the back foot and in arrears. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the submissions from NCPs wanted detailed accounting of how child support money was spent on their children. This was rejected by the committee as being too intrusive. However, the committee did feel that there was a good case to increase the flexibility of the scheme by allowing NCPs to direct certain percentages of their child support payments to specific expenses of their children: 20 per cent without the custodial parent's consent, a further 35 per cent with the custodial parent's consent and up to 100 per cent in cases of emergency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst much of the research underpinning the cost of children is internationally consistent, I for one have great difficulty appreciating the equivalent scale methodology; that is, that the difference between the spending patterns of parents with children and those without constitutes the cost of children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian formula is heavily reliant upon dated American research that may not be valid in Australian circumstances. It is unfortunate that the committee had access neither to relevant Australian research into the cost of children nor to studies which might have examined the impact of the scheme on the relative household income asset and debt levels of parents. Until such time as these studies are undertaken, any review of the formula will be somewhat limited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">DSS has the government monopoly on modelling the impact of the formula. Over a six-month period, DSS modelled eight self-support levels and three disregard income levels, providing some 2,000 pages of modelling information to the committee. It is hard to disagree with one commentator who described the research into the cost of children in the modelling as `statistical voodooism'. The committee had little choice in accepting the percentages; however, it recommends modifications to the formula, and these are considered to be the minimum necessary to restore equity. These changes cost the government approximately $13 million in a full year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I join with the Chairman of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price). I also acknowledge the presence in the chamber of the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) and the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell), two of the other members of this committee, which has had a difficult task over the last 18 months in dealing with the myriad problems raised by the child support scheme which have been referred to by the honourable member for Chifley.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After being set up to deal with an urgent problem&mdash;the maintenance of children after divorce or separation&mdash;the Child Support Agency, as the chairman has pointed out, has become the problem. That was the conclusion of the parliamentary committee of which I was a member for the last 18 months of its inquiry. Perhaps the most extraordinary thing about the report of this all-party committee was its unanimity. The Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues had public sessions across Australia and took over 6,000 written submissions. Telecom recorded more than 150,000 attempted phone calls on the inquiries hotline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tens of thousands of Australians, both custodial and non-custodial parents, mothers and fathers, are simply not happy with the operation of the child support scheme, set up in 1988 to deal with the general non-support of children by non-custodial parents. At that time, around only a third of non-custodial parents, usually fathers, gave their families any maintenance at all and, on average, they gave a pittance of under $30 a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The administrative burden of the scheme continues to grow like topsy, with another 7,000 clients being added to the Child Support Agency's case files every month. It is a burden with which the agency has been ill-equipped to deal, partly because of the way in which the agency was conceived in the first place. It was placed within the Australian Taxation Office and staffed from the Taxation Office on the basis that it would be a minimal contact with clients. The idea was that the staff would just collect and disburse maintenance money on behalf of their clients. The reality is that income tax is a whole lot simpler and more clinical than the messy, emotional situations that attend relationship break-ups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Partners do not do what they are supposed to do: they hide assets and income with their girlfriends; pay too little, late or not at all; and others are wont to shut out the ex-partner, refusing access to children or making it difficult. The result is that clients of the Child Support Agency need not minimum but maximum contact with agency staff. They cannot even get through on the telephone without protracted attempts and lots of waiting. The Child Support Agency is also ill-equipped to deal with its ballooning client numbers because its management is chronically unable to identify and rectify its own poor administrative and management practices, so the additional resources allocated by the government have fallen on waste ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The joint committee has noted in its report `a general lack of national direction and coordination of CSA activities'. The end result is `an often appalling client service delivery by the Child Support Registrar and the CSA which often appears to reflect an expectation that the problems clients have, and the clients, will go away if their rights are not explained'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chief indicator that the Child Support Agency is not working is the blow-out in the child support debt due to $481.5 million, which included $202.5 million for default assessments. Over 97,500 payers are in arrears and more than 50 per cent of the total debt has been outstanding for more than a year. This belies the much vaunted collection rate of 73 per cent which the agency says is the highest in the world. The committee believes that it is a poor indication of the agency's performance because it includes all those couples who have registered their voluntary payment arrangements with the agency, even though the agency has nothing to do with them. As private arrangements make up 32.5 per cent of the Child Support Agency's case load, this represents a sizeable dent in its collection rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A consistent complaint of custodial parents who were not receiving maintenance from ex-partners was that they had to do the detective work, chasing their exes. The committee found that, despite the presence of the Child Support Agency within the tax office, the ATO's expertise in debt enforcement and collection was dramatically underutilised. Nor was the Child Support Agency found to have a handle on ensuring quality staff training. Telling custodial parents experiencing problems receiving payment that they would be `better off on the dole' was not seen by the committee as a sign of quality staff training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee found that the time-lag between the starting date for maintenance liability and the transfer of the first payment to the custodian of the children was inordinate&mdash;an average of approximately 142 days. From the other side, there was also considerable time-lag in informing the non-custodial parent of his or her liability so that by the time they learn about it they have a very considerable debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme has not been without its successes and a change in community attitudes has been one of them. It is now generally accepted that non-custodial parents must continue to have responsibility for their offspring. Fifty-six per cent of child support liabilities are paid on time. For this reason, the committee believes that, as long as child support is paid on a regular basis, non-custodial parents should be able to pay the Child Support Agency without having the indignity of their wages being automatically deducted. The committee also believes that it should be possible to pay child support directly into the bank accounts of custodial parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee favours stringent enforcement measures against non-payers of child support including reports to credit reference bureaus, the introduction of private process servers, the impounding of passports and seizing of assets where a child support debtor tries to leave the country to escape his debt and the penalty of imprisonment for no more than six months for anyone who makes a false or misleading statement in a material particular to the Child Support Registrar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also recommends that the custodial parent's disregarded income level be reduced to $19,723.60, increasing by $624 per annum for each child in line with the Department of Social Security cut-off point. The current self-support component for non-custodial parents, which is equivalent to the single pension rate, is also regarded by the committee as too low because it fails to recognise the additional costs of employment borne by employed non-custodial parents and the fringe benefits available to pensioners. It was also noted that Family Court settlements have failed to take note of child support developments and do not take into account future maintenance payments in the division of assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The joint committee was hampered in its inquiry by a lack of data from the Child Support Agency, which made it impossible to know the extent to which outstanding debt is being improperly avoided or whether it represents a real and genuine incapacity to pay. As the scheme has been in operation for five years, this was thought to be particularly deplorable. The Department of Social Security, which administers child support policy, distinguished itself by its evasiveness in giving evidence to the inquiry. This was such that had it been given in a court of law a judge would have been constrained to direct the jury to consider whether it was self-serving and biased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is an internal one. The department which is supposed to review the operation is the one which formulated it in the first place. It has a perceived interest in vindicating its own creation and is hell-bent on preserving the status quo in a manner well known to all who have ever watched the television series <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister</EMPHASIS>. The government will have its work cut out to have the recommendations of the joint select committee implemented by what has been seen by the committee members as an unwilling department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I add my vote of thanks to the members of the secretariat: to Jane Vincent, the committee secretary; to Matthew Mason-Cox, the senior parliamentary officer; to David Wallace, the legal adviser; to Susan Cardell, the research officer; and to Lesley Cowan and Debbie Devlin, the secretarial support. The fact that there were over 6,000 submissions to this inquiry and over 150,000 attempts to contact the inquiry by telephone&mdash;this being the largest inquiry in terms of submissions and attempts to contact it in the history of the Commonwealth parliament&mdash;indicates the work the secretariat was involved in: a very complex and complicated area of law and social policy. The thanks, I believe, of all the members of the parliamentary committee in both this chamber and the other place are sincerely delivered to the members of the secretariat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I remind the House of&mdash;in all but one minor area&mdash;the unanimity of the committee in relation to this matter and the attempt by the committee to balance the obviously conflicting demands between custodial and non-custodial parents. This report represents not a series of items which can be looked at as one or the other but in effect a package of recommendations, all of which integrate and interrelate to each other. I join with the honourable member for Chifley, the chairman of the committee, in heartily endorsing the committee's report and the recommendations not only to the House but also to the government, which now has the responsibility of taking them up and, we pray, implementing them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present  the seventh report of the committee for 1994 relating to a new laboratory complex at DSTO Salisbury, South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The committee's seventh report of 1994 deals with the proposed construction of a new laboratory complex at DSTO Salisbury, South Australia. DSTO Salisbury is located 22 kilometres north of Adelaide. It accommodates DSTO's electronics and surveillance research laboratory, which principally undertakes research into electronic based defence systems. The present research facilities are spread over 1,000 hectares and 650 buildings, many of which were constructed for the manufacture of explosives in 1940. The proposal examined by the committee involves concentrating DSTO's research activities into a 280-hectare site and providing a new laboratory complex, which will accommodate 545 research and support staff.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has recommended that the project proceed at an estimated outturn cost of $50.714 million. The committee concluded that facilities at DSTO Salisbury represent a substantial investment by the Commonwealth and occupy a much larger than necessary site. The committee notes that, arising from the defence white paper, there will be no change to the direction in which DSTO is proceeding, nor will there be a change in the need for the laboratory complex. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was advised some six weeks ago, after the public hearing and within days of the report being presented to parliament, that the plans and drawings of the proposed complex presented to it at the public hearing had been changed. The committee was extremely concerned about the changes which were made to the design and made its displeasure known to defence officials at a subsequent meeting at which the background and the substance of the changes were discussed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee concluded that the revised design represents a major departure from the design originally submitted to the committee by the Department of Defence. The committee could not understand why these substantial changes had not been envisaged at the hearing. At the very least, the committee should have been alerted to the proposed changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the committee agrees that the revised design is an improvement, the circumstances surrounding the development of the original design lacked the rigorous analysis necessary for a special purpose building such as this. For these reasons, the committee has recommended that the Department of Defence review procedures for the testing of schematic designs against user requirements to minimise changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has also recommended that the Department of Defence consult with staff associations regarding the revised design, and report to the committee about these consultations. The question of the effectiveness of open-plan offices in increasing productivity was raised by a number of staff associations during the public hearing. The committee believes that the time has come for the Department of Defence to undertake or commission a study of the impact on staff efficiency and productivity of open planning and other forms of office accommodation. Other recommendations in the report deal with heritage matters, consultations with state and local governments and soil remediation of the greater Salisbury site. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Standing Committee for Long Term Strategies, I present the committee's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's population `carrying capacity'&mdash;One nation&mdash;Two ecologies</EMPHASIS>, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KH4">Mr BARRY JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;This report of the Standing Committee for Long Term Strategies, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's population `carrying capacity'</EMPHASIS>, subtitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One nation&mdash;Two ecologies</EMPHASIS>, addresses the controversial issue of Australia's future population and its relationship with immigration. The committee's report, which was unanimous, reached 16 conclusions and made 15 recommendations, which are set out in the last chapter. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our findings essentially fall into four major headings, the first being the need to distinguish between population policy and immigration practice. At present, Australia has no population policy which expressly sets out broad goals for the long term. In fact, we set immigration targets year by year, reflecting current economic factors such as unemployment or economic growth rates but having long-term population implications. Accordingly, we tend to back into the development of population policy by confusing it with immigration practice. Immigration intake must be an instrument of population policy. Population policy cannot be a long-term unconsidered side effect of ad hoc immigration practice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, as the illustration on the report's cover suggests, in physical terms, the continent of Australia may be conceived of as two highly habitable segments or islands, separated by an enormous sea of arid and semi-arid landscapes of mainly salty and sandy soils occupying some 70 per cent of the continent's 7.7 million square kilometres. The islands are the south-west corner of Western Australia and the Cairns to Adelaide seaboard. Tasmania is a third island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In paragraph 2.79, the committee recognised the sharp contrast between the carrying capacity of `arid Australia', which is 90 per cent of the area, essentially six huge federal electorates, and `arable Australia', which is 10 per cent of the area with about 750,000 square kilometres&mdash;roughly equal in area to France and Britain combined and where 95 per cent of Australians live&mdash;hence, our title <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One nation&mdash;Two ecologies</EMPHASIS>. It is conceded that the two are interconnected and that each of our major cities has a huge `footprint' from which its resources are drawn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the committee concluded there is no danger or crisis point beyond which population cannot be supported in the longer term. The greatest threat to environment is not population per se but population factored by levels of per capita resource use. In paragraph 2.80, the committee concluded that CSIRO's `I = PLOT' formula&mdash;in which `I' is `impact', `P' is `population', `L' is `lifestyle', `O' is `organisation' and `T' is `technology'&mdash;is a valuable conceptual tool, with its recognition of the importance of the organisation of space and technology as determining factors in the quality and form of human settlement. The Netherlands has a far higher population density than Haiti, but its quality of life is superior because of better organisation of resource use, including waste management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, to preserve existing lifestyle options for Australians&mdash;including access to flora, fauna and wilderness&mdash;as well as to ensure optimal lifestyle choices for the future population, strategic steps must be taken now to conserve resources, improve waste management and encourage sustainable agricultural practices. Having a population policy will help us to see where we are going in relation to all these other quality of life factors as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When considering what Australia's population policy should be the committee has not recommended a specific `target' or `optimum' figure but has set out a series of principles on which such a policy should be based. The fundamental principle is that any decision about the size of Australia's population in the next 50 years will essentially be political and must take account of social, cultural, historical as well as environmental factors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the first heading, `The need to have a population policy and to distinguish it from immigration policy,' the committee concluded in paragraph 1.65:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In population matters, Australia cannot rely on luck and chance factors. It must know where it wants to go. The explanation offered by the Government at the Cairo Conference on Population and Development (1994) that `Australia does not have an explicit or formal population policy' in part because there would be a `diversity of community views as to the character and objectives of such a policy', is at best an agnostic position, at worst an abdication of responsibility simply because the subject is difficult. However . . . the Committee agrees that specific population targets&mdash;a particular figure to match a particular year&mdash;would be rigid and self defeating. Nevertheless, ranges of options should be explored and discussed.</PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 1.66states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was clear from the submissions to the Committee, media reports about the Committee's `immigration enquiry' and public comment generally that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">population</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">immigration </EMPHASIS>are regarded as virtually synonymous. They are not.</PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 1.67 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Committee's opinion it is essential that Governments of whatever political persuasion understand that establishing a population policy is a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">primary</EMPHASIS> goal and that setting immigration levels is a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">secondary</EMPHASIS> consequence of the population goal. The cart must not be placed before the horse making population policy merely an undefined, inexplicit consequence of immigration policy.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee made five recommendations under this heading:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.The Government should determine that population policy and immigration policy are quite distinct, with differing goals, although the long term consequences are inextricably linked, and immigration is a major instrument of population growth. The political and administrative responsibility for population and immigration must be separated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.The Australian Government should adopt a population policy which explicitly sets out options for long term population change, in preference to the existing situation where a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">de facto</EMPHASIS> population policy emerges as a consequence of year by year decisions on immigration intake taken in an <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">ad hoc</EMPHASIS> fashion, such decisions being largely determined by the state of the economy in the particular year and with little consideration of the long term effects. Population policy is central to establishing national goals and must involve the Prime Minister directly.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Specialist Medical Review Council has been set up to review statements of principles issued by the Repatriation Medical Authority. Those statements of principles will be issued when there is sound medical scientific evidence that indicates a particular kind of injury, disease or death can be related to service. Thus there is an inherent difference between an appeal to the Veterans Review Board and a review by the Specialist Medical Review Council. For the VRB, medical expenses relate to an individual's condition whereas for the Specialist Medical Review Council medical expenses would relate to evidence about the causation of a particular kind of injury, disease or death.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill will amend the law relating to infrastructure borrowings, giving effect to new taxation and administrative arrangements for infrastructure borrowings as foreshadowed in the Working Nation statement on 4 May 1994. The bill will amend both the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Development Allowance Authority Act 1992. Working Nation announced that the date of effect would be from 1 July 1994. This has changed to the date the bill receives royal assent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of infrastructure borrowings was first announced in the One Nation statement on 26 February 1992. The measure was intended to encourage the private sector to make a real commitment to the provision of publicly accessible infrastructure on a commercial basis. Those infrastructure projects with lengthy construction periods may not produce assessable income for some years and may accumulate tax losses in the early stages of development. Therefore, where taxpayers borrow funds to finance the construction of those projects, they are often unable to access the interest deductions available to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By making interest on infrastructure borrowings non-assessable to the lender and non-deductible to the borrower, the tax benefit of the interest deduction is transferred to the lender in the form of non-assessable interest income. This enables companies to raise funds at a lower interest rate, thus reducing the borrowing costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will extend the range of sectors within which projects may be eligible for infrastructure borrowing financing and will modify the administrative and taxation treatment of infrastructure borrowings. These amendments are intended to make infrastructure borrowings more attractive to investors and to facilitate even greater private sector provision of publicly accessible infrastructure. I turn now to a more detailed discussion of these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Broader Range of Eligible Sectors</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the original arrangements, eligibility for infrastructure borrowings is restricted to the construction of new land transport facilities, seaport facilities and electricity generation facilities.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill proposes to broaden eligibility for infrastructure borrowings to include aviation facilities, electricity transmission and distribution and gas pipeline facilities, water and sewage treatment projects and other water infrastructure. This will provide a greater opportunity for private sector investment in these areas. Broader eligibility for infrastructure borrowings is in line with the important role enhanced efficiency in these sectors has in the government's micro-economic reform program and the assessment that such infrastructure projects can make an important contribution to economic development and international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">New Administrative Arrangements</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existing law covering infrastructure borrowings is contained in division 16L of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and is administered by the Australian Taxation Office on behalf of the Commissioner of Taxation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The infrastructure borrowings measure is not operated currently as a program with a formal approvals process. The bill will introduce new administrative arrangements for infrastructure borrowings. The Development Allowance Authority will be responsible for the approvals, management and monitoring functions relating to infrastructure borrowings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the new administrative arrangements, prospective borrowers will need to apply to the Development Allowance Authority for eligibility to issue infrastructure borrowings. When the Development Allowance Authority is satisfied that the applicant has met all eligibility criteria, it will issue a certificate in relation to the borrowing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Development Allowance Authority may cancel a certificate if the conditions attached to it are breached. Where a certificate is cancelled it is proposed the certificate holder will be liable for the payment of a charge. The government will be moving amendments during the consideration in detail stage of this bill to give effect to this proposal. This is designed to provide a deterrent to the borrower in breaching the conditions while not penalising the lenders. The Infrastructure Certificate Cancellation Tax Bill 1994 which we are debating cognately forms part of this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with its current functions, the Development Allowance Authority will continue to work closely with the Australian Taxation Office. The Australian Taxation Office will retain responsibility for ensuring compliance with the tax laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Development Allowance Authority having responsibility for infrastructure borrowings will provide a single point of contact and a greater flow of information between the public and private sectors. This will enable the infrastructure borrowings initiative to be promoted more effectively in the business community and among the general public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the infrastructure borrowings measure will operate on an ongoing basis, and the Development Allowance Authority will now have the role of administering the concession, section 98 of the DAA Act, which provided that there would be no substantive appointment of the DAA on or beyond 1 January 1997, will be repealed. This, in effect, results in the Development Allowance Authority being in an on-going position. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">More Generous Taxation Treatment</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Design of the Concession</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the existing treatment of infrastructure borrowings, interest on the borrowings is non-assessable to the lender and non-deductible to the borrower. The aim of this is to lower the cost of finance for certain infrastructure projects. Therefore, infrastructure borrowings can be issued at a lower, after-tax rate. This will be attractive, in straight price terms, to taxpayers with marginal tax rates higher than the company tax rate. However, tax exempt interest may not be as attractive to all lenders, for example, investors with tax rates below the company tax rate, such as superannuation funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Providing a tax rebate instead of non-assessable interest income will help increase the attractiveness of infrastructure borrowings to low tax rate investors. The bill proposes to change the design of the tax concession to provide for the option of a tax rebate of 33 per cent as an alternative to the current non-assessable income arrangement. The interest payments from infrastructure borrowings will continue to be non-deductible to the borrower. Investors will be able to elect whether to treat interest as exempt or to include it in assessable income and receive a tax rebate of 33 per cent of the amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The non-assessable treatment of interest will remain attractive to investors with tax rates above the company tax rate, while the option of a rebate will make infrastructure borrowings attractive for taxpayers with marginal tax rates below 33 per cent. This modification is designed to increase the pool of funds available to private sector infrastructure providers wishing to access infrastructure borrowings. </PARA>
<PARA>Twenty-five year Ownership Rule</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the existing legislation, companies wishing to issue infrastructure borrowings must intend to own, operate and control the infrastructure project for at least 25 years from the time the facility becomes income producing. This requirement is intended to restrict the transfer of infrastructure projects from the private to the public sector. However, it also prevents the transfer of ownership to other private sector investors. The bill proposes a relaxation of this requirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sale of infrastructure assets will be permitted within the 25-year period where the prospective buyer is sufficiently commercial to meet the other borrower requirements for infrastructure borrowings. Only a body which is approved by the Development Allowance Authority will qualify as a suitable purchaser of an infrastructure facility. This amendment will make the requirements more consistent with business practices, while ensuring that the infrastructure facility continues to be operated by the private sector, on a fully commercial basis, for 25 years. </PARA>
<PARA>Concessional Period</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the current arrangements, infrastructure borrowings receive concessional treatment for a maximum period of ten years. The bill will extend the existing maximum term of 10 years for the tax concession to 15 years. However, the term of the borrowings is not restricted to 15 years. This will facilitate investment by the private sector in infrastructure projects with very long construction periods that are expected to be in tax loss for more than ten years. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Technical Amendment</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation contains an amendment to the operation of infrastructure borrowings additional to those announced in Working Nation. This amendment is required to remove references to outdated Loan Council procedures in the existing legislation which refer to `global borrowing limits'. The amendment replaces the eligibility requirement relating to the Loan Council with new guidelines designed specifically for infrastructure borrowings. The new guidelines are designed to determine the commerciality of government owned bodies and will be published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth of Australia Gazette</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I foreshadow three further sets of minor amendments the government will be moving during the consideration in detail stage. The first of these amendments relate to the definition of `Crown lease'; it expands the definition and widens the scope of projects eligible for infrastructure borrowings. The second set of amendments is required to extend the eligibility for infrastructure borrowings to bores and to make it clear that the associated pumping equipment and structures used for the purpose of providing bore water for public consumption will be eligible for infrastructure borrowings. The third set of amendments is designed to clear up any confusion by infrastructure borrowers over whether they are subject to the old arrangements or the new arrangements announced in Working Nation. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Conclusion</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government believes that the changes proposed in the bill will increase the level of private sector investment in infrastructure.

It imposes a tax on infrastructure certificate holders if they breach the conditions relating to its issue and amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill amends the Developmental Allowance Authority Act 1992 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The purpose of this bill is to give effect to changes in the operation of infrastructure bonds as announced in the Working Nation statement delivered in May. The changes, we are told, are designed with the intention of making it easier to attract private funds for infrastructure projects, particularly by superannuation funds. The coalition does not oppose the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the One Nation statement of February 1992 the government announced that it would introduce infrastructure bonds to facilitate greater private sector participation in the provision of infrastructure through concessional tax treatment. To date, the concept of infrastructure bonds has been a dismal failure, as has been the rest of the One Nation statement. I will speak more about that a little later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Infrastructure bonds provide that interest payments are not deductible to the lender of the funds and not assessable to the borrower where the project is for one of the eligible classes of infrastructure borrowing. The altered tax treatment is designed to reduce interest costs to borrowers by providing that lenders are not assessed on interest income. An eligible borrower will be a company, or a unit trust taxed as a company, that intends to retain that entity for at least 25 years after the project first produces assessable income. Eligible infrastructure facilities at present are public transport infrastructure, seaport facilities and public electricity generating projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill transfers the administration of the infrastructure bonds scheme from the Australian Taxation Office to the Development Allowance Authority. Infrastructure bonds will be administered in the same way as the development allowance with the proposals being put to the DAA, which is to issue a certificate if the proposal satisfies the eligibility criteria. Concessional tax treatment will be available if a certificate is issued. The new administrative arrangements will enable investors to ascertain whether their proposal satisfies the eligibility criteria prior to the issue of the infrastructure bonds. Currently, concessional treatment must be sought after the bonds have been issued. To be eligible a project must be owned for 25 years after the investment was made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Difficulties have arisen with projects on crown leases as the land on which the project has been built could not be owned by the operator of the project. This problem was rectified by amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act in 1992, which provide that the scheme would apply to investments on crown leases if it could reasonably be expected that the lease would run, be renewed or extended for at least 25  years. This bill amends the DAA Act to include a similar provision so that the ownership qualification will be deemed to have been met for projects on crown leases if all other criteria are met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three eligible classes of infrastructure borrowing. The first is direct infrastructure borrowing where a company or a unit trust borrows for direct expenditure on an eligible facility and/or related facilities where the entity intends to own, use and control the facility for 25 years. The second is indirect infrastructure borrowing where the borrower intends to use the money only to lend to another for expenditure on an infrastructure project for which a certificate is in force. The third is refinancing infrastructure borrowing where the borrower must intend to use the money to repay a direct infrastructure borrowing, an indirect infrastructure borrowing or another infrastructure refinancing borrowing where there is a certificate already in force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all cases, the borrowers must satisfy the borrower requirements. If the money is not to be used immediately, it is to be invested in a prescribed investment. The borrower must be incorporated or a corporate limited partnership during the year of borrowing and not be a trustee or, where the borrowing relates to direct infrastructure borrowing or the refinancing of direct infrastructure financing, a corporate unit trust or a public trading trust. The entity must also intend to maintain this status during the period for which the facility is to be retained. There are restrictions on the alienation of interests where a person, alone or with associates, controls more than half the voting rights in the borrowing entity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill expands the range of facilities that may be the subject of infrastructure bonds. The range of categories for infrastructure borrowings will include the following: a land transport facility, which may comprise a road tunnel, bridge or railway line, to be used to transport the public or freight at a charge levied in Australia; an air transport facility, which may consist of a runway, associated taxiway or apron, to be used by aircraft transporting the public or their goods at a charge levied in Australia; a seaport facility, which is to be a wharf or dock, to be used to embark or disembark the public or their goods from seagoing ships at a charge levied in Australia; an electricity generation transmission or distribution facility, which includes a generation, transmission or distribution facility, to be used principally for the direct or indirect sale to the public. I suppose it goes without saying that the facility must be constructed on land in Australia. It will include a gas pipeline facility for the transport of gas from a processing plant on land in Australia principally for sale to the public. It should be noted that the ATO has stated that gas pipelines that are reserved wholly for the use of a single enterprise&mdash;that is, a company or consortium&mdash;are excluded from this section. It will also include a water supply facility consisting of one or more dams, weirs, reservoirs or tanks relating to public usage where the public is charged; channels or pipelines used to supply water to the public at a charge or to connect storage facilities used to supply the public at a charge; pumps associated with  the pipes or channels; or treatment facilities for making water fit for human consumption that will be supplied to the public at a charge. Perhaps the government has in mind privatising water supplies, but I do not think that is necessarily the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This section incidentally does not include artesian bores, which are the primary source of water supply in many areas of my state of Western Australia and, indeed, outback Australia. It could be argued that the section does include bores, but it would be preferable if the section were amended to include bores specifically. There may be some attempt to do that in the amendments foreshadowed by the Assistant Treasurer a little earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sewerage or stormwater facilities are to comprise equipment, excavations or structures used to treat, at a charge to the public, sewerage or other waste water to reduce the harm it would cause on disposal or making it suitable for reuse; and/or channels, drains or pipes connected therewith. A related facility will be one which is reasonably necessary for the infrastructure facility to operate. A number of items are specifically excluded from the category of `related facility'. These include a road, bridge, tunnel or railway built to provide access to infrastructure facilities; a dry dock or ship; a dam or coalmine for electrical facilities or facilities for transporting water or fuel to the facility; hangars and aircraft for air transport facilities; or a gas processing plant, drilling or extraction equipment for a gas pipeline facility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Applications for certificates must specify the dates by which the applicant intends to borrow the money and spend the money for the appropriate purpose; and for indirect infrastructure borrowings or refinancing borrowings a copy of the application for the facility to be financed must be provided. The DAA must issue a certificate if it is satisfied that the borrowing is infrastructure borrowing, the dates in the application are reasonable and, for indirect infrastructure borrowing where there is not already a certificate in force for the facility, the DAA issues a certificate for that facility at the same time as it issues a certificate for the indirect infrastructure borrowing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, a certificate will not be issued if the borrowing is a direct infrastructure borrowing and the DAA is satisfied there is a law in force that will restrict other facilities from competing with the infrastructure facility. A certificate will be issued subject to certain conditions and the applicant must give an undertaking to comply. The conditions relate to the applicant continuing to comply with the matters listed in the application. The holder of certificate may apply for conditions to be varied and the DAA is to approve changes if satisfied that it would have issued a certificate if the original application had included those conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides that the holder of a certificate and a person to whom the project is proposed to be transferred may apply to the DAA for the transfer of the certificate. The DAA is to approve the transfer provided the transferee will meet the conditions attached to the certificate. The bill also provides for regulations to be made, fixing the maximum cost to revenue of the issue of certificates in any one financial year. Once the limit is reached, no more certificates are to be issued in that year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, a certificate may be cancelled on a number of grounds, including a failure to provide information; providing false or misleading information; a breach of a certificate's conditions; where the certificate is for indirect infrastructure borrowing or refinancing borrowing; or where the certificate is for the refinancing of an indirect infrastructure borrowing. The DAA may require applicants or certificate holders to provide information or documents; holders of certificates are to provide annual returns to the DAA; and the DAA is to advise the Commissioner of Taxation of the issue transfer and cancellation of certificates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to remove provisions relating to the approval of infrastructure bonds and to extend the concessional tax treatment available to certificate holders. Some of these amendments will insert a number of definitions into the act. The exemption period will be extended from 10 to 15 years from the beginning of the term of the borrowings or, if the certificate is a refinancing certificate, the period remaining to 15 years from the original borrowing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Entities that receive interest from an infrastructure bond will be provided with an alternative to not include interest earned in their assessable income. Under the alternative, the entity will be able to include the interest payments in their assessable income and claim a rebate of 33 per cent of this amount. The estimated cost to revenue of these measures is expected to be nil in 1994-95, $9 million in 1995-96, $18 million in 1996-97 and $34 million in 1997-98. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier, the measures in this bill were first announced in the Working Nation statement on 4 May 1994. This bill seeks to remedy the total failure of the infrastructure bond scheme to date, as it was introduced in the One Nation statement of February 1992. We debated the Pooled Development Funds Amendment Bill 1994 earlier this year. The PDF scheme, though, also failed to meet Labor's unreal expectations. John Kavanagh, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly </EMPHASIS>of 2 July 1993, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paul Keating's One Nation statement in February 1992 launched a fiscal program designed to help revive the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The slow take-off of many of the government's initiatives has been well documented, but One Nation has other problems that are just coming to light.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The package included two tax advantaged investment incentives: pooled development funds and infrastructure bonds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So far, not a single dollar has been invested through these pools.</PARA>
<PARA>That was in July last year. To date, only one proposition for infrastructure bonds is actually under consideration. Mission Energy, the company that has purchased the Loy Yang B power station in Victoria for $1.3 billion, wants to issue $420 million in infrastructure bonds. However, the banks do not believe that such an issue is easily marketed to private investors. Kavanagh also had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In theory, tax free bonds should be popular with private investors, who pay the highest tax rate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the bankers' view was that private investors would not go for bonds structured with a ten-year life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The average time horizon on a retail investment product is three or four years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The banks thought they would have trouble selling long-term bonds at a time when interest rates were low.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill does little to enhance infrastructure bonds in the eyes of the general public, the investing public, as it increases the minimum life of the bonds to 15 years, despite the experience I have just outlined. The banks are now trying to construct a package that will appeal to institutions, at least in the short term, until the institutions can sell the bonds to private investors. Superannuation offices are the key institutional investors being targeted for the issuing of infrastructure bonds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from Mission Energy, there is only one other project that I am aware of. This is the possible issue of infrastructure bonds for the Collie power station in Western Australia. But that option is still far off into the future, as far as I can tell. There could also be other projects on the drawing board, but because of the long lead times they might not proceed for some years to come. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to gain a true picture of the extent to which the infrastructure bond program has failed. This is because Treasury and the ATO do not keep records of how many bond issues have actually occurred. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, really. When control of the process is taken over by DAA, however, it should be possible to improve the monitoring and reporting of the scheme. When infrastructure bonds were announced in One Nation, the government expected infrastructure bonds to attract billions of dollars. This bill is recognition of the fact that the infrastructure bonds concept has, thus far, failed. Yet the government is set on a policy course of tinkering with the scheme, rather than establishing the overall economic framework that will increase the levels of investment in both infrastructure and other productive areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fiddling with the scheme, the government has widened the scope of infrastructure projects that can be financed by infrastructure bonds. Hence there is an increase in the dollar amount of infrastructure bonds on offer. This will just as likely be due to investment in bonds in newer eligible projects, not an increase in those areas where infrastructure bonds were previously allowed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, though, the widening of the eligibility of allowable projects no doubt arises from consultation with industry players who have made it clear to the government that the eligibility requirements were too narrow and excluded many other worthwhile infrastructure projects. This consultation, which is commendable, shows that Labor has been unable to develop a process of policy development and implementation that truly reflects the economic realities. The infrastructure bond scheme constitutes just one more failure by Labor to implement its One Nation proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One Nation was an example of policy making on the run. It was rushed out at great speed and was not thought through. It was a panic measure in response to the coalition's Fightback policy document that had been released only a couple of months earlier. Many absurd claims were made in the One Nation statement. I remember one lulu was that the budget would be in surplus by 1995-96. There was going to be a $5 billion tax cut in the second tranche of tax cuts. One Nation itself proposed tax cuts of approximately $8.3 billion in two tranches, the second of which was in excess of $5 billion, and that was going to be delivered in 1995-96. Where have all the tax cuts gone?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a reformed Prime Minister who has joined the deficit daleks. There were going to be 800,000 new jobs by 1996. The unemployment rate was going to be down to 8.25 per cent by this year, 1994. There was going to be an avalanche of new investment. It was claimed by the government that $130 billion was likely to result from the 10 per cent development allowance. Pipedreams! The pooled development funds scheme was to provide huge benefits, if you remember. Under One Nation, Labor was to sell off Qantas, increase aviation competition, establish a national electricity grid and rail network, introduce foreign branch banking and establish effective offshore banking units. In the One Nation statement a total of no less than $16.6 billion of new promises were made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How do the One Nation forecasts compare with the current situation? We still have 9.5 per cent unemployment, or over 800,000 Australians still unemployed. Far from tax cuts, we had massive tax hikes in last year's budget and more modest bracket creep induced tax rises in this year's budget. Despite those massive tax hikes in last year's budget, which are flowing through into this year's revenue and resulting in huge increases in the government's take, we will still have in the year to come, 1994-95, a budget deficit far in excess of the $12 billion originally forecast in One Nation. We will have a projected Commonwealth debt of $95 billion within the next year or so. One Nation guaranteed the current account deficit would not increase, yet it continues to mushroom. Just as infrastructure bonds have failed to meet the government's high expectations, pooled development funds have also been a resounding failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Traditionally, the public sector has been the almost exclusive provider of public infrastructure, and that is still the case today. What has changed is that the real amount being invested by governments at federal and state levels has declined markedly as a percentage of gross domestic product. While this decline has been occurring for at least 30 years, it is in the last 10 years that we have seen the sharpest decrease of investment in public infrastructure. In the last 10 years the amount of public sector investment as a proportion of gross domestic product has fallen by approximately 33 per cent. This decline has been explained in part by the reduced levels of investment by state governments in areas such as electricity generation and the decline of investment in the public schools system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the recent ALP conference in Hobart, the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) had a public spat about whether public spending on infrastructure is and has been adequate over the past 10 years. Of course, the Treasurer did not agree that public infrastructure investment was at an unreasonably low level. The Treasurer maintains that necessary infrastructure spending should be picked up by the superannuation funds. However, the fact remains that, although the states may now have less to invest in schools and power stations, there are many other areas of public infrastructure that desperately need increased investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why have the states not shifted investment into these areas? The answer is: they cannot afford it. The federal government has been financially strangling the states by reducing the amount they are receiving in grant payments. Since 1982-83 Commonwealth own purpose outlays have risen by 35.5 per cent in real terms compared with a reduction of 1.7 per cent for Commonwealth payments to the states. This happened at a time when Labor in Canberra was also shifting, by stealth, some of its responsibilities onto the states. Faced with this financial squeeze, the states have responded in the easiest manner: they have cut back on capital expenditure and, in many cases, left recurrent expenditure untouched. This was the easiest way for the states to respond to their tightening financial situation, even though it is arguably not in Australia's long-term interest. It is, therefore, not difficult to understand why our schools lack proper maintenance and our roads are crumbling. Federal Labor is to blame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition, as I stated earlier, does not oppose the bill. The infrastructure bond scheme was to provide a mechanism for channelling equity capital into necessary infrastructure projects of economic benefit to the community. The objective is commendable. But, like so many of the One Nation statement so-called initiatives, the program has failed to live up to Labor's expectations, and infrastructure bonds have, so far anyway, failed to attract public and institutional support. Though the coalition supports further private sector participation in the provision of national infrastructure, this is no excuse for the government to abandon its role in providing the funds to maintain the necessary level of infrastructure spending, and particularly infrastructure spending by state governments. This is specifically so where there is little or no profit to be gained by private interests investing in some infrastructure projects. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If government wants to get into this sort of business of having private enterprise funding and doing some of the government's work, then the government ought to open up the opportunities for private enterprise to come in properly, to take over and run an outfit&mdash;whether it be the generation of electricity, the operation of coal mines, the building of freeways or bridges, or anything else&mdash;and not use this half-baked approach of siphoning money out of appropriate use decisions made by the marketplace where we can get the best yield for Australia and Australian investors and employees rather than having a subsidised process, a favoured treatment process of encouraging, coercing and seducing capital that could well be put to better use in other areas into government use. I do not really go along with this halfway process of encouraging private enterprise investment in government in the way in which the government is proposing here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let me start at the beginning. I believe that the House needs to understand exactly what the government is doing here. One failure has led to a second attempt, and the second attempt being considered by the House is the Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill 1994. The process was announced in Working Nation, as has already been said. Working Nation was a gross failure. With the white paper and the One Nation statement, we have seen failure after failure. They have been the government's grand public relations exercises. Statements of the most extraordinary type about wiping out the deficit, cutting taxation and providing massive increases in employment opportunities have been overtaken by reality as Australia struggles today with the prospect of both increased taxation and increased interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Featured in the parliament today, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) failed, answering question after question, to acknowledge that he would not increase taxation and that he would not increase interest rates. In the House today, he even failed to acknowledge, and damned in strong terms&mdash;in the same terms he condemned the coalition's last election policies&mdash;a goods and services tax or a value added tax. In fact, by his silence, the Prime Minister endorsed what the opposition knows is going on in the government&mdash;that is, a serious examination of indirect taxes. That is occurring in the government. Government members have acknowledged it time and again, and the Prime Minister today would not rule out using the very approach that he so strongly condemned about 18 months ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian people have become most cynical of the Prime Minister's regard for the truth. They have come to know him and know that, under any circumstances, he will say anything that suits his purpose simply to skate through the moment, the next week or the next election. This taxation process and the infrastructure borrowings go to the very nub of Australia's huge deficit. The government is seeking to pass off roads, ports and a whole range of infrastructure to private enterprise and to hide the massive debt which has produced a declining investment. Infrastructure really refers to those things that belong to the public of Australia and helps us to produce and do things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has a declining interest in these matters. From time to time, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) yells out, `Hey, what about infrastructure?' then for a couple of days everybody says, `Hey, what about infrastructure?' and then it goes away as the rationalists in the Keating government say, `No, we can't use money like that.' But the government is using money, and is proposing to use money, by giving favoured treatment to private enterprise to woo funds from superannuation sources for government projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The infrastructure borrowings bill was announced in the Working Nation statement in May this year with changes designed to make it easier to attract private funds for infrastructure projects. The One Nation statement in February 1992 announced that it would introduce infrastructure bonds to facilitate greater private sector involvement. That failed and, 2 1/2 years later, we have infrastructure bonds that provide interest payments, that favour private enterprise and that seek to encourage private enterprise investment in government projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will be done through the Development Allowance Authority, and infrastructure bonds will be administered in the same way as the development allowance. There are three types of eligible projects: direct infrastructure borrowing, which is where a company or unit trust borrows to invest directly into a project or facility; indirect infrastructure borrowing, where borrowers intend to use the money only to lend to another person to expedite a process that second or third party may be involved in; and refinancing of infrastructure borrowing, where a borrower uses the funds to repay direct infrastructure borrowing and in that way refinance an existing project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill expands the range of facilities that may be subject to infrastructure bonds. In Australia, there are land transport facilities&mdash;including road, tunnel, bridge or railway&mdash;that use the transport of the public and their goods at a charge and there are air transport facilities such as runways, taxiways, aprons, et cetera. This could open the way for Badgerys Creek to go ahead, controlled by the notorious Federal Airports Corporation, and could also open the way for some horrible mess similar to the one the government has created at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. The local government bodies of western Sydney wanted it to be straight private enterprise with a bit of an interest from themselves but, of course, the government will not wear that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sea port facilities are also eligible for these projects. Electricity generation, transmission or distribution; gas pipeline facilities; water supply facilities; sewerage or storm water facilities&mdash;or pipes connected to any of those sorts of water use projects&mdash;are infrastructure and I welcome the broadening of these proposals. However, a number of items are specifically excluded from the category of related facility&mdash;that is, a road bridge, tunnel or roadway built to provide access to an infrastructure facility, a dry dock or a ship. The government has excluded the application of these funds for a number of things. The DAA may cancel a certificate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no cost to the government this year. As previous speakers have already said, that means there is no cost to taxpayers. The taxpayer subsidy to this sort of project will be $9 million next year, $18 million the year after, and $34 million in the year 1997-98. It has been suggested that a 33 per cent tax rebate option specifically designed to attract superannuation fund investment is not generous enough to attract the funds to invest. Super funds are being wooed into these projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I indicate that I am not sympathetic to the use of private funds in this way. I just do not think the government can skate through by pulling out after having borrowed massively itself and created massive debt in Australia. Creating a further debt on favourable terms to the government is the wrong way to go. The government should be encouraging people to pay off the debt, in fact seeking to reduce the debt itself rather than go further into debt. I suggest that the government should investigate ways in which private enterprise can directly invest in land transport facilities. Why is the government not proposing that process where, with the states, they can allow direct private enterprise participation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government can set any rules it likes for private enterprise participation. It can remain in control. There is no give-away. The air transport facility proposed here has been part of infrastructure bonds. The government is seeing how much of the FAC it is going to sell, or what leasing arrangement it is going to come to. It is a terrible mess. The government fought about it at the federal conference in Hobart and arrived at a mishmash of a solution, which was hailed by the most bigoted parts of the press as an absolute stroke of genius on the part of the Prime Minister. It will prove to be unworkable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have the government on the one hand saying we ought to privatise this area but on the other hand saying we need to attract private funds into this area under concessional arrangements. Why can the government not say, `Let's go full private enterprise but we retain the right to say what will be done and how it will be done?' For instance, there are a number of corporations around the world that could build Badgerys Creek to the specifications of the Commonwealth. I do not see why the Commonwealth has to own, put its seal on and control every feature of an airport. On the one hand it says it needs to do that; on the other hand it tries to attract private enterprise under concessional borrowing arrangements. I do not understand the rhyme, reason or logic of what the government is doing here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Electricity generation and transmission could also be done by private enterprise. Why not try a private enterprise power station or two, see how they work out and see what the conditions are that have to be applied? This infrastructure borrowings bill is a half-baked solution. It seeks to take more money out of the system, put it into government projects and, in that way, increase our real debt. It is not a fair dinkum way of moving on with infrastructure projects. The same applies to gas pipelines, water supply facilities and sewerage and stormwater drains. </PARA>

I have felt it in mine. All members of the House have seen a rise in the rate of unemployment and the number of bankruptcies. These occurrences have been brought about by the government's policy on interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our current interest rate regime has provided the sharpest increase in long-term interest rates since financial deregulation. This directly relates to this bill in which the government is trying to encourage private enterprise funds into long-term investment.

You should be worrying about getting that deficit down. You should not be worried about spending more money. You should not be worried about spending $34 million of taxpayers' funds to give concessions to private enterprise to invest in government projects.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Our examination of the amendments proposed by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) do not reveal anything to which we can find objection.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice in amendment No. 3 circulated by the Assistant Treasurer that water supply bores are specifically mentioned to extend the eligibility of infrastructure borrowings to include bores drilled for the purpose of providing water for public consumption or for other use by the public at a charge to them. It is doubtful whether that amendment addresses the preferred position of the coalition in the sense that it refers to water for public consumption. So in the existing legislation there is enough confusion to warrant our posing the question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition makes the point again that artesian water is an essential element of agriculture and grazing activities in outback Australia. There is every reason to think that that comes into the category of infrastructure borrowings, but only where the water produced is made available to the public and a charge levied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With that question mark, as it were, the coalition has no objection to the amendments. As far as we can tell, we agree that the amendments improve the legislation. There are new definitions contained in the amendments which address what was not satisfactorily dealt with in the amending bill, such as the meaning of crown lease for the purposes of the bill. That is certainly a welcome addition. I suppose the general comment, once again, is: why was it not included in the main amending bill? It is not as though this is an isolated example; it seems to be the case regularly with tax bills. I can understand the difficulty. I do not want to oversimplify the issue, but it happens with regular monotony. We have talked about this in the consideration in detail stage and in the committee stage when that was relevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is not going to let go of its criticism that copious amendments to amending legislation seems to be the order of the day with taxation legislation. Anyone who contemplates the provisions of tax legislation will understand how difficult it is. We can look at subsection&mdash;wait for it; do not go to sleep&mdash;159GZZZZE (1A).

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not in any way deprecating the efforts so far made in trying to simplify tax law. So far, it is confined to the substantiation provisions. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) was kind enough to give me a look at those provisions very early on in the piece. As far as I can tell, without the benefit of expert advice, the provisions suggest that it is possible to express tax laws in plain English, provided they meet the objectives of the government and protect the interests of all taxpayers, including those who, with the benefit of professional advice, have to top up, and that is a very commendable start.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that there are something like 5,000 pages of law in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. That is ignoring this piece of legislation which does in part amend that principal act. That said, the opposition continues to criticise the government and the minister for introducing amendments at this stage of the debate. I had occasion to remark at the outset of my speech in the second reading debate that, under the arrangements that we adopted, which coincided with the creation of the second chamber, the procedure that has been adopted in this place is that the second reading speech is delivered by the minister and the opposition is bound under the new arrangements to debate the second reading immediately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall that, prior to these arrangements, the House and therefore the opposition, which is of immediate interest to me, was given the opportunity to study the second reading speech as well as the explanatory memorandum and bills themselves. That opportunity is no longer available in the majority of cases. As happened this evening, the minister made his second reading speech&mdash;and I know I can be accused of ranging widely, but I will come back to the amendment&mdash;without us having any prior knowledge or indication of what material he may cover. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Had he not been under the obligation to introduce amendments, it would have been bad enough, but the truth is that the opposition was confronted with a need to put its remarks in context. As the leader in the debate for the opposition, I was in the unenviable position of not knowing what the Assistant Treasurer had in mind. To put my remarks in context, I had to go over exactly the same material that the Assistant Treasurer had covered. Under the previous arrangements, it would be relatively simply and standard practice for me to simply refer to the intention of the government expressed by the Assistant Treasurer. As it was, I have had to put my remarks in context. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, were very tolerant in that you did not interpret what I did as tedious repetition. It was not intended to be, but it was. </PARA>

We really do not have the same opportunity to look at the explanatory memorandum as we do with the main amending bill. So we have a problem of the detailed amendments amending the amending legislation. We have comprehensive information in the form of amendments to the amending bill. We do not get the explanatory memorandum until we are bound to consider the amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has been the tenor of my complaint for a long time with successive pieces of tax legislation and it remains with this piece. There has to be a better way. What is effectively less than 24 hours notice of an explanation in the form of an explanatory memorandum for complex amendments to an amending bill on tax legislation is totally inadequate. I am not in a position to say whether clause 23, proposed section 159GZZZZD, will have the particular effect claimed of it by the government, nor in the majority of cases does the explanatory memorandum make it clear. Even when it does, we simply do not have the opportunity to study its implications in any detail whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat the timeworn criticism in the hope that one day it will sink in. That is, if we are to be a truly legislative chamber, we will need to be given the information in a timely way. If these sorts of detailed amendments have to be produced in this way, virtually on the very day that the principal bill is to be debated, we simply cannot study their implications. The consequence of that will be that our friends in the Senate will examine them, probably in detail. A possible consequence of that is that the bill will come back to this chamber for further amendment. I think there is a more efficient way of doing it. I think a reasonable person would understand that. I know that the minister does understand it, but he gets caught up in the time constraints which are imposed on him. It is far from adequate and far from satisfactory. I hope I have made the point again. </PARA>

Indeed, we are grateful for that. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has not addressed my question of whether that applies only to providing water for public consumption. I suppose it does. It is not all that important, but I acknowledge that on this occasion the government did accept what the opposition had to put.</PARA></TALK.START>

There is no way we can, because we have this confusing substitution and inversion of words and insertion of clauses which require the enumeration, including four Zs, provided for in less than 24 hours, which is the effective time available. I put it to the Assistant Treasurer that that is totally inadequate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the explanatory memorandum, I do not want to go around the paddock too many times but it seems to be a criticism this government gets from the member for Curtin that we do not put it out in time. In fact, I can remember that for a previous tax bill we actually dropped the explanatory memorandum around to the office of the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party (Mr Costello) some days before. The member for Curtin rolled up here and criticised the government for not giving it to him and then said that I should give it to every speaker, whether opposition or government. I am quite prepared to give it to the government speakers, but I think it is up to the opposition spokesman to give it to the opposition speakers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not going to take time this evening, from the mere five minutes available to me, pointing out the gross immorality of the Keating government's reneging on Australia's agreement with New Zealand regarding Air New Zealand's access to our domestic air travel market. Nor am I going to recite the litany of manoeuvres and subterfuges that this government&mdash;in concert with Qantas's management&mdash;is undertaking to make the government owned airline look efficient and businesslike, in order to maximise the revenue that this government has so exaggerated in its budget projections.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather, I am going to concentrate on the aspect that this Labor government always ignores, whilst nevertheless sanctimoniously proclaiming its agenda is best for the country and its citizens&mdash;namely, the impact of this immoral behaviour on Australia's tourist industry. Unfortunately the visitor industry has been completely abandoned&mdash;left out of the equation&mdash;in the backroom alchemy of the oft delayed Qantas float. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It clearly needs to be restated, yet again, that this industry is a vital sector of Australia's economy. The visitor industry is our greatest generator of employment, and the economic base for the survival of many family and small businesses. The visitor industry is one of the `big three' earners of foreign exchange, together with iron and coal, and a major source of taxes, fees, and charges for all levels of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The visitor industry employs without discrimination: men and women; the young and the not so young; skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled workers; the full-time and the part-time job seeker. Jobs in this growth industry provide upward mobility and career paths&mdash;not dead ends. What other industry holds so much promise to assist in the solution of our present disastrously high unemployment levels?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Playing games with the very engine room of employment, foreign earnings and Australian investment is not only counterproductive&mdash;it is a complete sell-out of the `Aussie battler', the very person this Labor government professes to represent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">International tourism to Australia is one of the major export earners of foreign exchange&mdash;visitors bringing funds from another country and spending them within our country for goods and services creating massive employment, and value-added activity at each step of their circulation through the arteries of commerce of our nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">International visitor arrivals from any country are in direct proportion to the distance and time zones people are required to travel and cross. Thus New Zealand, with a population of only three and a half million, generates more visitors than do much wealthier, more highly populated countries further away. This fact is borne out in my electorate of Moncrieff on the Gold Coast. With over 600,000 international visitors spending their holidays in this area each year, New Zealand accounts for 22 per cent&mdash;over 132,000 foreign tourists per annum&mdash;whilst the United States and Canada combined account for only seven per cent of international visitors, or 42,000 tourists per year. With twice as many overseas visitors arriving each year as the total permanent population of the Gold Coast, one can readily see the vital economic force and employment base that the visitor industry provides in my area alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore government decisions should be directed towards the enhancement and enlargement of this major visitor source&mdash;not, as is the case, restricting and penalising our visitor industry by reneging on the Air New Zealand agreement that would have provided additional capacity and market promotion. We as a nation cannot afford to tolerate this sort of cavalier, irresponsible action that can only jeopardise or inhibit our visitor industry. We must do everything within our power to protect, encourage, and enhance the international visitor industry. We must support the efforts of Air New Zealand to stimulate our economy and increase our employment. We cannot allow the Keating government to get away with stymieing and starving the goose that is ready, willing and able to lay golden eggs of increased visitor arrivals into Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Tuesday 15 November in my contributions in this House to the racial hatred legislation I outlined the situation of some Spanish speaking workers who were on strike from their factory at Steel Line Doors at Sumner Park. I would like to take a few moments this evening to update the situation for the House on what has happened with regard to that strike. The workers concerned are still on strike and have been now since 10 November. Despite the fact that they have had a conciliation hearing at the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, there is still no resolution of the matters under dispute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To inform members of the House what the dispute was about, these Spanish speaking workers have suffered or are alleged to have suffered major discrimination, victimisation and violence, all racially based at work. The violence has resulted in accidents and injuries to workers. A number of them have either permanently left the employ of Steel Line Doors or are on sick leave because of the injuries that they sustained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, at the conciliation hearing, I am led to believe, the management of the company has refused to accept any responsibility for the violence, harassment and discrimination that has occurred at the workplace despite the overwhelming evidence that this is occurring. Incidents outlined show that there are consistent breaches of workplace health and safety regulations occurring at the place and that the management has deliberately and negligently allowed this violence to continue despite the overwhelming evidence of what has occurred and the fact that a number of workers have suffered injuries as a result of the violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This dispute would have been resolved if the management had accepted its responsibilities to provide a workplace free of violence. All the workers requested was a guarantee from the management of their safety. If they were guaranteed that they would be able to work in a safe environment free from harassment and violence they would have returned to work immediately and they would have then subsequently allowed negotiations to occur to resolve the other matters they had under dispute. But because the management refused to accept its responsibility as a management to protect the workers on-site from violence, from racial hatred and from intimidation those workers are still on strike and there is still no resolution. The 24 families of the workers at that place have not had any income for three weeks. It is a totally unsatisfactory situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, because the matter is before the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission&mdash;I am led to believe there is going to be a hearing on this matter in a couple of weeks time&mdash;the Industrial Relations Commission has not been able to be involved. It has said that the other commission has jurisdiction at this stage. But I certainly urge all parties to this dispute to sit down and seek a negotiated settlement. The first and most important thing that must occur is the management must accept its responsibility to provide a workplace free from the racial hatred, the violence and the harassment that has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One example of harassment that occurred was the fact that a worker was almost run down by a supervisor driving a forklift. The supervisor at the time just laughed it off when the worker had to jump out of the way, roll over and bang into the side of the factory wall to escape being run down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other instances have occurred in this factory that makes roller doors. One of the supervisors pushed a roller door when it was on the line on top of a worker. The worker had his leg cut and a hand damaged because of that incident. As a result of that incident, the worker has still not been able to get a workers compensation claim paid because the management of that factory has refused to approve it. In fact, the Workers Compensation Board has engaged in what I call interrogation and harassment of the worker in trying to resolve whether or not the claim is a legitimate claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the trade union movement, the Industrial Relations Commission and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to work together to try to seek a resolution of this dispute, in the interests of the fairness of the workers and in the interests of that company, so that it can get back in full production. The El Salvadorian and other Spanish speaking workers who were employed at that factory had very high productivity and were recognised as some of the hardest workers in the factory. They were very productive workers and they want to go back to work. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I would like to put on record the results of a recent court case. The subject of this case was a Mr Stuart Keen, a pharmacist in Wingham, who over the last 12 months has taken on the government over the issue of generic brand substitution of drugs. It is widely believed throughout the community that he has actually forced the government into bringing forward the legislation which has now been introduced, and we commend the government for that. The former Minister for Health&mdash;although he spoke at length on occasions and was reported widely as being in favour of introducing the legislation which the current Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) ultimately did&mdash;did not do anything about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding the fact that the government was in the process of drafting legislation which was going to address the exact situation that Mr Keen was trying to bring to the attention of the Commonwealth government, the court case went ahead and has been completed. So I can make some comments. Unlike much of what we discuss in this House these days, this is primarily a good news story, and I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) at the table would agree, seeing as the government has introduced the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After a marathon hearing at Taree local court in mid-November, Stuart Keen was cleared of all 19 breaches of the National Health Act. Even though Stuart Keen pleaded guilty to supplying generic brand drugs in place of the brands prescribed by doctors, no conviction was recorded against him. Mr Keen received a 19(b) ruling which, as you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, under federal laws is basically a guilty without conviction record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taree local court was filled to capacity with supporters of Mr Keen. Supporters also stood outside the court carrying placards such as `Don't crucify Keen' and `Wingham hero, national hero'. In the judge's summation, the only thing that he could see that Stuart Keen had done wrong was to save people money. Magistrate Gary O'Keefe's very words were, `The only misconduct I can see is that he saved people money.' The judge also made mention of the guidelines set down by the pharmacy board and the schedule of pharmaceutical benefits, commonly known as the `yellow book'. The judge made it clear that had Stuart followed the guidelines he would also have been in breach of the law. Not only Stuart but every pharmacist in Australia was, therefore, at fault prior to December 1 in that year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lesson learnt was that the schedule of pharmaceutical benefits is not gospel. One worrying incident that emerged from the Keen court case was that under cross-examination a representative from the pharmacy board revealed that the new schedule of pharmaceutical benefits drawn up to include details about generic brand substitution had, indeed, been done so without the new legislation as a guideline. Wrongly, the new schedule was drawn up before the legislation was drawn up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not seen a transcript of the court case, but I understand what came out of it was that the new schedule relied largely on hearsay from within the industry as to what guidelines to draw upon. The minister should take heed of this and, if necessary, take action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are problems within the pharmaceutical administration that need to be reviewed. Since following this case, I have received numerous complaints about the frustrating nature of the bureaucracy within the industry, and it is surely time the minister checks out her channels of communication and information between the industry and her office. I am disappointed with the government's fence-sitting on this issue. Both the former minister and the current minister have been unable to fully endorse the actions of Stuart Keen and have been unable to offer any ministerial support throughout his principled stand. As is typical of this government, nothing more than lip service was provided throughout Stuart's ordeal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that his crusade for what he believed to be morally correct&mdash;and his situation has basically been vindicated by the government now introducing and passing the legislation that it has&mdash;cost Stuart Keen $50,000 personally to conduct that court case. Although it was found that what he had done was legally wrong&mdash;he acknowledged this&mdash;he single-handedly waged that crusade for what he believed to be morally right. As I say, he has been vindicated by the government in the introduction of its legislation. I said in speaking on that bill that I commend the government for taking that stance. Generic brand drugs have been dispensed in public hospitals for many years and it is about time the rest of Australian consumers received the benefits of their pharmacists being allowed to substitute generic brand drugs at a cheaper rate than the more common brand name drugs. </PARA>

We are continually stating that, in the forest industry, downstream processing and value adding are the goals for all to inspire to. French Enterprises has done this with the recent new addition of a laminating plant. With this process, it services another market niche. It saw the need to laminate on-site and, thus, value add to its production and offer employment opportunities to unemployed persons in the north-east.

I wish to read from a page of a recent promotional brochure of French Enterprises:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Great Depression that ended so many aspirations and dreams during the 1920s in many ways is responsible for what today is one of Tasmania's great business success stories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was the Depression that dictated that Sydney French could no longer viably produce the blackwood furniture that had been the core of his business. Instead, he turned to sawmilling and in 1929 the foundation stone of the operation that exists today was laid down. The sawmilling operation commenced in 1929 manufacturing timber for the construction of Tasmania's railway bridges, many of which are still being used today. The outbreak of World War Two heralded the introduction of the first kilns used for drying timber. Right throughout the war S. French &amp; Sons produced kiln dried timbers for the manufacture of boxes principally used in the dehydration storage of vegetables produced at a Scottsdale plant. In the years following the war change became an invited guest at S. French &amp; Sons. Hardwood mouldings were in keen demand as building levels increased, and the dry pine box was replacing many of the traditional green hardwood apple boxes. 1960 saw change of ownership. The company was purchased by sons Graeme and Kevin French and soon after French Enterprises came into focus.</PARA>
<PARA>French Enterprises is serious about where it is going. As it states elsewhere in the brochure:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A crystal ball we have not. The opportunity to adapt and meet the demands of the future we most certainly have. French Enterprises' life story reveals a business that is constantly ready to an adapt to new challenges.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Section 130(3)(a) of the Health Insurance Act provides that an officer of the Health Insurance Commission shall not divulge or communicate to any person any information with respect to the affairs of another person except in performance of duties or functions under the Act. These requirements are taken very seriously by the Commission and are regarded as reflecting the Government's intentions that personal information should receive maximum protection. The Act provides some exceptions to this requirement; for example, the Minister may certify that it is necessary in the public interest that information should be divulged, or may form the opinion that a person is impliedly or expressly authorised by the person to whom the information relates to obtain it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each request for the release of information in the public interest is considered on its merits. In general, requests from law enforcement agencies for information, including that relating to serious offenders, are refused.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) There is no doubt that there is a public interest in apprehending suspect murders, drug traffickers and extortionists. The test of the secrecy provisions of the Health Insurance Act is not that such a public interest exists but whether it is sufficiently strong to counter the public interest of confidentiality imposed by the legislation such as to make it necessary that the information be released.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) The requirement that hostels meet the cost of providing continence aids was introduced in May 1992. Many hostels were already providing continence aids before its introduction for all hostels.</PARA>

The Schedule has been distributed to all hostel operators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The "Hostel Booklet" was issued to all hostel operators in March 1993 to provide a practical guide to the Commonwealth's regulation of hostels. The Booklet states (at page 6.1) that the provision of Personal Care Services includes the various consumable goods required to deliver them. Continence aids are cited as an example of the consumables to be provided as a part of continence management services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry groups and hostel operators have also been advised of the requirements in correspondence since November 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) The requirement was a part of revised hostel funding arrangements introduced in April 1992. The arrangements provided a three level subsidy structure with higher subsidy rates paid by the Commonwealth in recognition of the higher costs of caring for more dependent people, including costs associated with continence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Variable fee scales also allow hostels to set fees based on a resident's capacity to pay. Resident fees can be reviewed annually to take account of changes in a resident's capacity to pay and care needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The service requirements and funding arrangements ensure that residents have access to continence assistance, including continence aids, as they need them with costs spread across all residents according to their capacity to pay and supported by higher subsidy rates. The alternative of requiring individual residents to meet the costs would involve substantial expense for people who may only have limited financial means once they have paid hostel entry contributions and on-going fees.</PARA>

When determining the source of supply the most efficient source is utilised and for common consumer items local procurement is the norm.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1988, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology was asked to investigate the problems faced by small business as a result of government regulations, the impact of government policies and ways in which problems in these areas could be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's report, Small Business in Australia: Challenges, Problems and Opportunities, was released in January 1990 and contained 66 recommendations on areas including regulation reform, trade practices, taxation, the availability of capital, management skills and the ability of the small business sector to participate in policy development processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government provided a detailed response to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology report in November 1990.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Communication and wide consultation are vital to the development of effective small business support and development policies. A wide range of public sector agencies, from all tiers of government, provide services that affect the small business sector in one way or another. To this end, it was vital that the Government recognise this in its response to the Parliamentary report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many recommendations raised in the Parliamentary report required extensive liaison across Commonwealth agencies and between Commonwealth and State/Territory agencies, while other recommendations were targeted specifically at State/Territory agencies.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its response to the Parliamentary report, the Government addressed each of the 66 recommendations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very nature of policy formation and implementation dictates that it is impractical to provide implementation dates for each of the initiatives stemming from the Government response to the Parliamentary report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To illustrate this point, Recommendation 9 contained in the Parliamentary report called for the Department of Industry, Science and Technology to examine the particular needs of small business at different stages of growth and tailor policies accordingly. This recommendation was agreed to in the Government response and the small business sector is now a key focus of the Government's overall industry development agenda. However, it is clearly not possible to identify an implementation date in this instance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be noted, prior to addressing the specific initiatives adopted by the Government in response to the Parliamentary report, that small business policy development has entered an important new phase since the Government provided its response to the 1990 Parliamentary report. The May 1994 White Paper on Employment and Growth, Working Nation, details a raft of new small business support and development initiatives and provides specific detail on the Government's overall approach to industry policy development through the remainder of the 1990s and beyond.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bureau of Industry Economics (BIE) now produces an Industry Brief on the Small Business Sector, released twice yearly, and this complements the yearly Small Business Review.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 4: In the period since the release of the Government response to the Parliamentary report, strong linkages have been established between Commonwealth agencies on small business issues.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To ensure that small businesses themselves have access to clear information about government support and development programs, the establishment of AusIndustry was announced in the White Paper and this will allow businesses a central contact point for information on programs run by Commonwealth and State/Territory agencies and also selected private sector programs.</PARA>

The Annual Reviews have been received very favourably by the target audience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 5: Following the release of the Government response to the Parliamentary report, the Commonwealth, State, Territory and New Zealand ministers with responsibility for small business met on four occasions and a formal consultative mechanism, in the form of the Industry, Technology and Regional Development Council, has now been established. The Council met on 28 October 1994 and signed a Memorandum of Understanding regarding the establishment of the new AusIndustry network.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 6: There have been significant changes in the manner in which the Government approaches small business policy formation and implementation since the release of the Government response to the Parliamentary report in 1990. One of the most important of these changes has been the incorporation of small business policy issues into the work agenda of all areas of the Department of Industry, Science and Technology. The Small Business Unit was disbanded in 1993 following an independent review of the Department's structure and activities. The disbandment of the Unit and incorporation of small business activities into the work of all Departmental areas has proven extremely effective and the increased policy attention now paid to the small business sector is evident in the May 1994 Working Nation statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 7: The National Small Business Centre was incorporated as a company limited by guarantee in January 1992. Financial and in-kind sponsorship has been secured from a range of companies. The Government provided seed funding of $75,000 to assist in the fundraising activity and a further one-off grant of $200,000 to match that of the major sponsors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 8: A conference of business associations with small business membership was held in Sydney on 14 February 1990 by the then Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business to discuss the Parliamentary report, and to ascertain the interest of associations in forming a national representative body for small business. Associations were not inclined to establish a national peak body but did agree to meet on a regular basis as a National Small Business Forum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ten National Small Business Forums have been held with the Eleventh scheduled for 18 November 1994.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 9: One of the chief successes flowing from the Government response to the Parliamentary report was the significant increase in awareness of small business issues from within both the public and private sectors. Within the Department of Industry, Science and Technology significant changes have occurred to reflect the high priority the Government now places on the small business sector. The high priority given to small and medium enterprises in the May 1994 Working Nation statement stands testimony to the success of this new approach to small business policy development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 10, 41: The Department of Industry, Science and Technology does not have a role in the direct delivery of business management training to small business start-ups. These services are delivered by the State and Territory-based small business agencies. Although the nature of services varies between States and Territories, all seek to maximise the exposure of the advisory services available for established and start-up small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Industry, Science and Technology is endeavouring to improve both the quality and the usage of advisory services to small business in the private and public sectors throughout Australia. At the meeting of Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers responsible for small business on 28 August 1992, Ministers wrote to two major accounting bodies asking them to consider the mutual benefits, to both their members and small business clients, of a national system of training and accreditation for "small business specialist" accountants.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Delivery of localised management education services by industry associations has been a high priority of the Small Business Coalition. Industry associations are becoming increasingly aware of their potential role in assisting small business to access training, particularly through the use of their extensive networks.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At their meeting on 28 August 1992, Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers responsible for small business agreed to write to the Treasurer supporting amendments to the taxation structure to encourage intending small business owner/managers to undertake training prior to the establishment of their businesses.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The study found that the level of government paperwork is not as high as anecdotal evidence might suggest. However, specific areas of concern were identified. For instance, it was found that a heavy paperwork burden fell on the building industry. As part of the Business Regulation Reform Package, announced in the Working Nation statement, the Government announced the development of an interactive computer system that will allow for the formulation, lodgment and consideration of development and building applications on screen, thereby saving considerably on the time and paperwork necessary for building developments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further study focussing specifically on tax compliance was jointly conducted by the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of Industry, Science and Technology.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Potential case managers, including those responding to the advertisement, were processed first, given the time constraint and number involved. The kit was then mailed to members for information and general promotion of case management. Accreditation and contracting of case managers will be an ongoing process for as long as case management is needed and applications for accreditation can be lodged with ESRA at any time. The closing date for this initial round of applications for accreditation was necessary to enable Interim ESRA to process the applications and invite tender submissions in time to meet an expected starting date for contracted case management early in 1995. Subsequent applications for accreditation will be processed as soon as possible and accredited organisations will be invited to submit tenders in later rounds of tendering.</PARA>
