<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I wish to refer to a matter of privilege. You are aware, Mr Speaker, that the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues is currently considering an inquiry into the operation of the Child Support Agency. The committee has not yet reported. In the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> of 11 June there was published under the by-line of Cheryl Critchley an article referring to the inquiry. The report referred to members of the committee being given a 600-page draft report containing 150 recommendations to reform the Child Support Agency. It went on to outline what were said to be recommendations in the report.</PARA></TALK.START>

The joint select committee has not authorised publication of any draft report. Mr Speaker, there appears to be a prima facie case of contempt in respect of both disclosure and publication.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government's view on this matter has already been stated clearly by the foreign minister in the Senate last week. It is no doubt inevitable that issues between the two countries such as the recent issue of press closures are issues on which we will disagree. But I think the broader issue is the nature of the relationship and how difficult issues within it are managed. I said today on radio&mdash;let me repeat it&mdash;that Australia has been forthright in putting its views about liberty, freedoms and human rights in Indonesia and in other parts of the world. But we still maintain broad relationships with countries like China which have state control of the media, and with countries like Malaysia which have a very substantial degree of discipline over the media. Because of the breadth of those relationships, that is as it should be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of Indonesia, the government has said it was disappointed by these closures. As Indonesia changes, as it continues to grow, as incomes continue to rise, as wealth continues to be distributed, as the nature of its economy continues to be outward going, there will be changes in the way in which Indonesia is managed. Some of those stresses and strains will show up in matters such as these. The point is that I will be seeing President Suharto tomorrow. Again, I am not in the business of saying to the Leader of the Opposition or to the media in Australia what I will say to President Suharto before I see him.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, refers to one of the most significant initiatives in the government's white paper on employment. Can the minister inform the House of progress of negotiations with employers on the training wage? When is it intended that the training wage be introduced?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1916" SPEAKER="Crean The Hon S.F." NAMEID="DT4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="HOTHAM" MINISTERIAL="EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Port Adelaide for his question. Of course, the training wage is a very significant development and part of the armoury of this government in fighting unemployment. I am pleased to report to the honourable member that significant progress has been made on agreement to, and, therefore, speedy implementation of, the training wage. Last Tuesday I met with employers. At that meeting we ironed out most of the wrinkles as they perceived them so far as the training wage was concerned. I had a further meeting on Friday where all the wrinkles were ironed out, I am pleased to say. Employers have now unanimously agreed to the rates as previously negotiated between the ACTU and the Metal Trades Industry Association&mdash;and, of course, involving the government&mdash;but, importantly, they have also agreed to the detail of the award. This has to be contrasted with the in-principle agreement that employers gave to the training wage soon after the government's white paper was announced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The meetings last week were attended by a significant group representing the peak bodies of employers in this country. Not only was the Metal Trades Industry Association present; so were the Australian Confederation of Commerce and Industry, the Business Council of Australia, the Victorian Employers Confederation of Commerce and Industry, the National Farmers Federation and the Retail Traders Association. All have now agreed unanimously with the government's position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The significance of the training wage is fourfold. Firstly, for the first time it will introduce an adult training wage. Secondly, it will simplify the complexity of rates now applying to youth in this country. Importantly, it will base the rates on competencies and qualifications achieved; they will not be based on age. The third important area is that the training which qualifies for this wage can be training done on the job. Therefore, it will enhance the thrust to enterprise bargaining and the significance and relevance of an enterprise's training needs. Fourthly, we have streamlined the process, through the establishment of the body called Nettforce, whereby the red tape has been cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> So the meetings that I have held with employers have been numerous and they have been constructive, although you would be forgiven for believing that the whole training wage was about to collapse, from the newspaper reports of a little over a week ago. The shadow minister seemed to be relishing the thought that it would collapse&mdash;paying lip-service to the concept of a training wage but doing absolutely nothing constructive to achieve it. This is a government not just about developing good policy but prepared to get involved in the nitty-gritty of implementing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The training wage is a milestone achievement for this government. It will help propel the skill formation agenda of this country, which is essential to avoid skill blockages. It will certainly help the long-term unemployed get back into work. It will significantly and far more effectively match employer requirements for skill formation with the available skills of the work force or, if those skills are not there, with the mechanisms in place to ensure that they are brought up to speed. I commend this initiative to those on the other side of the House. I hope they get behind supporting at least one dimension of the government's policies.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. I am sure many honourable members would be aware of the changes that President Clinton has announced in the United States. From our point of view, the announcements that he has made serve to highlight just how much headway we have made in this whole area over the last few years. There is a range of proposals, the most controversial of which is a time limitation on the availability of so-called welfare support. A range of other proposals is bound up with President Clinton's proposals. These include trying to achieve a national system of child support, which in some ways would be analogous to the one we have already achieved here, and focusing additional amounts of assistance in the form of labour market program assistance to help sole parents get back into work. Again, in both those areas there have been some very significant achievements in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth making the point that there are important demographic and social differences between our circumstances and those of the United States. When thinking about whether it is appropriate or justified to have a time limit on income support for sole parents, it is worth bearing in mind that the policies we have put in place&mdash;designed to increase the self-sufficiency of sole parents&mdash;have been very successful. The jobs education and training program is a very well-structured and effective program to help sole parents. As a consequence of this and the child support scheme, we have actually been able to reduce very significantly the proportion of sole parents on the maximum rate of sole pension. It has gone down from around 84 per cent in 1983 to around 50 per cent now. That reflects the combined impact of our labour market interventions and our child support scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable members would be aware, the child support scheme has been operating over the past six years and, since 1988, very significant achievements have been made. Around $450 million has now been directed through that scheme; around 70 per cent of that goes to the benefit of sole custodial parents and their children, and a significant part of the remainder goes back to the taxpayers in the form of reduced social security outlays. The proportion of sole parents receiving child support has gone from around 26 per cent at the beginning of the scheme to around 40 per cent now. There has been virtually a doubling in the number of sole parent pensioners declaring maintenance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All in all, very considerable results have been achieved, given that we do not think it is appropriate to contemplate some sort of time limitation on access to these payments. We consider that would be highly inhumane. Also, in the light of the results that have been achieved, which have resulted in bringing down the average duration on the sole pension to around three years in this country in any case, it would be particularly inappropriate to contemplate the sorts of proposals that are being considered in the United States by way of a time limitation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the other measures in the Clinton package, as I said, we have already made very substantial headway in those broad directions. The net effect of that is to achieve a very significant improvement in the living standards of sole parents caring for children. This is an area of major achievement for this government in which I think we can justly take pride.</PARA>

Given the fact that bond yields have steadily risen since your appearance on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> program last Wednesday and that interest rates on fixed rate mortgages have already risen, do you now concede, as the Treasurer does, that official interest rates will be moving upward?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems to me that bond yields have moved up all over the world, so the shadow Treasurer credits me with great influence, I must say. My <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> interview must have travelled far and wide to have this devastating impact on bond yields. Thank you for the compliment. There is no doubt that skittishness in international markets has impacted and does impact into the Australian bond markets. There has been a view abroad about the prospects of inflation as recovery and strength of economic growth comes through the western economies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a view, particularly in the face of very low nominal and real interest rates in the United States, that monetary policy needed to be shifted. But I made the point the other day&mdash;I think it is worth making again&mdash;that, at their lowest point, interest rates in the United States fell to three per cent. That is the federal funds rate, the official rate. The official rate in Australia, the cash rate, fell to 4 3/4 per cent. That is 1 3/4 percentage points above where the United States' rates were. They are bumping up now against capacity constraints in the US in the labour market, certainly in the trained labour market, in the product markets and with plant and equipment. There has been a view in US markets that this will reflect in higher rates of inflation. This has permeated world markets and has had an impact here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said the other evening, interest rates here for business lending are somewhere between 6 1/2 and nine per cent, with a real rate of something like 4 1/2 to seven per cent. Even  if one were to take the gloomy view and say that inflation will be higher than two per cent in an underlying sense and, say, three per cent, a real rate of 3 1/2 or six per cent is not easy money. That is the point the Treasurer has made and the point I have made continually and consistently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Treasurer said is that as the recovery picks up and there is a call on savings by the private sector for plant and equipment and other forms of investment, in every other recovery the price of funds has risen. He is talking about them rising in this context not because of inflation getting out of control, but simply because of pressure on funds for resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I have made these points.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Bennelong says, `It has happened,' making reference to the two banks that have shifted their rates. There is a lot of competition in the retail banking sector these days and, as a consequence, some rates are decidedly lower than others. If, in the funding of those loans, a bank decides that its fixed lending rate should rise from 6.9 per cent to 7.4 per cent, I think, in the case of one, I do not think the opposition is entitled to say, `Shock, horror! The end of the world is coming.' Some books will be cast differently and, as a consequence, the lending policies of some banks will be different. Therefore they will lift their rates, but official rates have not risen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key point is that official rates have not risen. They have not risen because the government believes that inflation has been checked and that, from the official statistics, it has actually been decelerating. In that context, falling in with some sort of market sentiment from the northern hemisphere which says that inflation is going to be out of control, when we have just agreed to another two years under the accord of $8 to hold inflation in check means that the government will not be responding to pressures in the bond markets which are induced from other markets.</PARA>

The $1.6 billion is the tax credits that have been put forward by the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition spokeswoman on health.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first observation I make is simply this: it is only this side of the House that has the policy to keep wages in check. That is point one. We have done so for the eleven years of the accord. In most years we have had the wages outcome&mdash;that is, the national accounts average weekly earnings&mdash;at below the budget forecast, so the accord and its management have outperformed the official forecast for the year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recently concluded a further arrangement under accord mark 7 to adjust the bottom 20 to 25 per cent of the work force by two $8 per week increases. The rest of the work force will be adjusted by enterprise bargaining, giving Australia the kind of wage flexibility that, as with everything else, only a Labor government would have done. Whether it is deregulating the financial markets, or opening up the exchange markets or the product markets, or knocking the tariff wall over, or opening up telecommunications, or fixing the ports and wharves, in the labour market, as always, all the hard jobs get left at our door. Again we are seeing that sort of flexibility now running through the labour market. As a consequence, we are seeing wages maintaining low inflation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I made the other night was this: if you say to the work force, `Look, let's be in a national objective of restraining inflation', which the business community accepts and the work force accepts, and in a sense there is a compact on this, and we have inflation down, but then one of the markets that boast concern about the inflation rate&mdash;the bond market&mdash;says, `We don't believe that inflation has been defeated in Australia; we don't believe the national resolve; we are factoring in higher inflation,' and that ends up, as some of them would like it, reflecting in nominal interest rates and housing interest rates, why would any person in the work force say, `I've made my contribution'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interest rates are now rising. One of the principal points of low inflation is low interest rates. If the work force contributes to low inflation but does not get the low interest rates, what is it left with, if interest rates are to rise inexorably, other than to say, `This is the cost of living and we'll recover it in the marketplace'? Apparently the shadow Treasurer cavils at that notion. He thinks there is something fanciful about it. That is because he does not understand how the labour market and the economy work. If he had had a decade of wrestling with the double digit inflation bequeathed to us by our predecessors and getting it down in the context of wage tax trade-offs and productivity related wage bargaining, he would have some sort of deeper and incisive understanding about the relationship between wages, inflation and interest rates, and the role of interest rates in the economy and society, particularly in terms of wage costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government now has a productivity based wages system in place. On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> program last week, I said that the government will always have a weather eye on inflation. In any recovery, one would be recreant of one's duty not to keep a weather eye on wages&mdash;and we will&mdash;to see that, where wages are accompanied by productivity, we can be confident that the inflation rate is going to stay where it is. But where there are wage increases which are paid without a connection to productivity, the government will keep an eye on that. It is the government which has brought inflation in Australia back to and below the world average of our trading partners. It was never the coalition, which found itself unable to deal with inflation from the mid-1970s onwards.</PARA>

It is against this background that the federal coalition continues to advocate its Jobsback policy, the policy that gives all of the worst aspects of the old system in the United Kingdom and the old existing system in the United States, a system that provides no safety net at all, that provides a policy vacuum and a recipe for wage slashing and industrial conflict. The opposition's domestic role model is the Victorian IR system, the system that has now seen almost 400,000 workers resign from state award coverage and come across to the federal system. Only last week the Victorian Employee Relations Commission, that is the commission set up by the Kennett government, itself went to the extent of disowning the system.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting indeed that the only interest in that speech in the parliament came from our side of the House. That speech, which was given on 15 June, was the first major review of Australia's relations with that very important area, the South Pacific, since Senator Gareth Evans gave his constructive commitment speech in 1988. In my speech I reaffirmed the principle of constructive commitment as the ongoing basis of Australia's relationship with the South Pacific region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also restated Australia's enduring commitment to working with Pacific Island countries to help secure the future of the region. At the same time, I suggested that the end of the Cold War and the rise of APEC presented the region with very changed international circumstances and new challenges and that we were facing increasing social and economic problems which needed to be urgently recognised and addressed by the countries themselves in partnership with Australia. I said that Australia did not seek to impose its own solutions to regional problems, or that those problems were easily identified or not different between the separate countries, but that the Pacific Island countries themselves should accept greater responsibility for putting in place the kinds of policies and programs which were needed to achieve sustainable economic growth. That is important to maintain the support of donors and, equally, to attract quality foreign investment over the long term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a key part of that, I highlighted the importance of the sustainable management of island countries' natural resources, particularly in the fisheries and the forestry sectors, and the ways in which closer regional cooperation between the Pacific Island countries could give them more equitable returns from the harvesting of their resources. I noticed just today that the Papua New Guinea Minister for Forests was reported to have said that his country is losing more than $1 1/2 million a day from illegal logging exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also noted that there was great potential for ecotourism as a longer term economic alternative for the region, provided that the fragile environments of the Pacific Island countries could be protected from further economic degradation. I said, importantly, that this presaged the discussion which will occur at the South Pacific Forum to take place in Brisbane early in August. At that meeting regional leaders will discuss in a more focused way the opportunities for sustainable development in those countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The speech was telecast live in the South Pacific region and was very well received by Pacific Island countries as a confirmation of our serious and informed interest in the South Pacific region and of our continuing constructive approach to regional issues.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JF4">Mr CHYNOWETH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have great pleasure in presenting to the House a report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories on the proposal for pay parking in the parliamentary zone.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary zone represents the heart of the national capital and belongs to all Australians. The parliamentary zone is a major focus for tourists in the national capital. Visitors come to see their Parliament House and those other institutions and monuments that have been largely established and supported by government revenue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was the first public inquiry the committee has undertaken in relation to the parliamentary zone. On 21 December 1993 the then Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services, the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe), wrote to the committee referring to it a proposal by the National Capital Planning Authority, the NCPA, to install new parking signs and voucher machines within the parliamentary zone. The work was required for the implementation of pay parking within the zone. Pay parking was the method proposed to raise some $4.3 million of a total program of $19.3 million for the restoration and replacement program of national capital assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee supports the need for a coordinated maintenance program to ensure that the parliamentary zone is preserved and improved. Regrettably, the works proposal examined in the inquiry was not one that the committee felt would result in the improvement and enhancement of the parliamentary zone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was concerned that the installation of voucher machines and associated signs would have a detrimental effect on the appearance of the parliamentary zone and would be contrary to the high design standards enforced by the NCPA for other works in the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of the committee interpreted the scope of the terms of reference broadly to include the examination of the works proposal in its entirety. Without exception, all people and organisations who made submissions to the inquiry addressed the broader range of issues raised in the NCPA's proposal. This meant that the impact of the installation of signs and equipment was considered as well as the wider issues raised in the works proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of the institutions in the parliamentary zone were concerned about the impact of the proposal on tourist numbers and the detrimental effect on visitor enjoyment of national institutions. If the meter is running they would have to rush to avoid being fined and therefore the enjoyment of visiting would be diminished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some important Australian institutions could be financially disadvantaged by the proposal. The committee felt that insufficient attention had been paid to allaying the concerns of the major institutions in the parliamentary zone. The committee was also concerned about the possible impact of the proposal on the many volunteers who willingly give up their time to assist in the operations of some of Australia's most important institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In examining the details of the works proposal, the committee believed that insufficient attention has been given to the nature of the parliamentary zone, which is an area of substantial employment but lacks the normal commercial and community services found at other centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee received submissions from many people who work in the area. It was noted that no guarantee by the NCPA had been given that improved public transport links would be created to ensure an adequate service into the zone at peak periods. Also, in examining the works proposal, the committee was concerned that the revenue targets were unlikely to be achieved without a significant increase in the rate of charges for pay parking, which would be disproportionate to the commercial value of the parking sites. In addition, there is no guarantee that at the end of the restoration program the funds raised from the parking charges in the parliamentary zone would continue to be spent on national capital assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, the committee has recommended that parliamentary approval, as required under section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, not be granted for the proposal to install voucher parking machines and associated signs in the parliamentary zone; and that the National Capital Planning Authority, in consultation with other relevant departments, investigate alternative means by which additional funds could be raised to offset the cost of the restoration and replacement program of national capital assets. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would just reinforce the comments made by the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth). This was a relatively trivial inquiry, but many honourable members will be familiar with the fact that issues of this kind generate a lot of attention even though they are not of central importance, and we received a surprising number of submissions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would begin by thanking the committee staff for their work, as I am sure the chairman would have done if he had been given the time to do so. The work on this inquiry was very professional and thorough, and the drafting is an excellent summary of the issues. The chairman has summarised those points very well and I would also thank him. But let me just reiterate a couple of the very important ones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the chairman said today in preface to his remarks and as the report states at the beginning of the summary of conclusions and recommendations:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parliamentary Zone represents the heart of the National Capital, and belongs to all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>It was in that context we were looking at this inquiry. It is important that all the institutions within the parliamentary zone&mdash;the parliament, of course, but also the other institutions: the National Library, the National Art Gallery, the High Court, and so on&mdash;be freely available to people. To introduce pay parking seemed to us inconsistent with that goal. As well, the chairman has mentioned other issues that concerned the committee. We were not at all impressed with the idea of the introduction of voucher machines. We thought that they would not in any way enhance the aesthetic value of the area; in fact, we thought they would detract from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were concerned about the issue of who should pay for improvements. Of course, there needs to be improvements and maintenance in the area, and it is entirely appropriate that funding for those tasks come out of general revenue. It seems inappropriate that simply those who work in the area or those who volunteer to help at those cultural institutions, such as the gallery and the library, should be expected to pay for what is really a national asset. As the chairman has already said, we were not convinced with the revenue estimates and were quite deeply concerned that a modest level of parking fee, the introduction of which was proposed, would very rapidly become a larger one. We thought that there had not been adequate thought to alternative modes of transport through the area, and we believe that also needs attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important to note that there are alternative methods of funding improvements, other than just general revenue, if that is what the government really wants. A very obvious way of doing that would be through charging some kind of fee directly to the institutions which are located in the area. For example, charging rental for land in the parliamentary zone would be a very logical way of funding improvements and maintenance of infrastructure in the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I think the committee has made a very sensible recommendation. I fully expect that the government will accept it and take seriously the need to maintain well the beauty of the central area of the national capital, an area of which all Australians can be proud and, I think, most are. We should look for ways of enhancing that improvement rather than detracting from it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, the report I have just presented&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">ASIO and security assessment: a review of security assessment procedures</EMPHASIS>&mdash;is the result of a reference to the committee from the previous Attorney-General in the last parliament which was referred again by the present Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) in May 1993. In total, five public hearings were held, two in 1992 and three in 1993. Submissions were received from 29 organisations and individuals, and evidence was taken at both public and incamera hearings from agencies such as ASIO itself, the Attorney-General's Department, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the Security Appeals Tribunal, the Administrative Review Council, the Privacy Commissioner and the Merit Protection and Review Agency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report traces briefly the historical background to ASIO's present role in security assessment; from its establishment in 1949, through the royal commissions headed by Mr Justice Hope in the 1970s and the 1980s, to the present. In its examination of the issues, the committee came to several early and fundamental conclusions: firstly, that it remains in the national interest to restrict access to certain places and information; and, secondly, that the appropriate balance has been achieved between the security assessment role of ASIO and the access suitability decision making role of agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reaching these conclusions, however, the committee identified a number of areas of concern, namely: the intrusive nature of security checking, and the extent to which this process itself may deter suitable applicants for positions; the extent of security checking, resulting from the number of government positions requiring the occupants to have a national security clearance; the qualifications from a training and experience of agency officers involved in security clearance decisions; aspects of the procedures adopted by the Security Appeals Tribunal; and the lack of a right of review of agency decisions in relation to access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee makes nine recommendations in relation to these concerns. Among these are recommendations designed to: allow for greater public accountability by agency heads for decisions related to security access; review the privacy-intrusive nature of the present process; and establish a new security division of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and permit appeals to the tribunal in relation to access decisions by agency heads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report makes an important contribution to what should be a continuing examination and discussion of the sensitive issues involved in personnel security. This continuing examination must always seek to balance individual human rights with the needs of national security. I thank committee members for their contributions. I also thank the staff, particularly Donald Nairn, Pat Sherman and Miss Gillies; the secretary during the later stages of the inquiry, Mr Peter Gibson; together with Catherine Cornish, Margaret Gibson and Sophia Konti. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the Joint Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, I support the committee's report. Today I wish to speak about chapter 3 of the report which deals with the role of the agencies. The agencies have the final responsibility on security clearances. The committee raised some matters in this regard which were certainly of concern. The committee was particularly concerned about the role of the agencies and the extent of the somewhat intrusive questioning of security clearances. Obviously, ASIO has a role, and I certainly support the report's recommendations on ASIO.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over-classification was one of the matters dealt with by the committee. Too many positions are classified as security positions, and that sheets back to the agencies. The recommendations go further than that. On a matter of great concern to the committee, it is worth quoting from Mr Kevin O'Connor, the Privacy Commissioner, who states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Individuals must provide detailed personal information in a questionnaire and/or interview. These details are then checked against information held by other agencies&mdash;including the police and in some cases, ASIO, to confirm the details provided and/or ascertain if there is other relevant information. In some cases, personal information about third persons, such as spouses or other relatives, is collected and checked: this often occurs without the knowledge or involvement of these third parties. In such cases, the issue arises as to whether these third persons should be made aware that information about them is being recorded and given the opportunity to comment; and whether their consent is sought before checks are carried out.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee was impressed by the strength of the arguments of the Privacy Commissioner. The committee stated in the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The involvement of third parties on issues unrelated to work performance is an unwarranted and unnecessary intrusion on personal privacy.</PARA>
<PARA>To illustrate this, appendix C of the report contains personal particulars forms. Question 13 in the personal particulars form No. 1 is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Do you have a Spouse/De Facto/Fiance(e)?</PARA>
<PARA>Question 14 is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Has this person visited or resided overseas?</PARA>
<PARA>That question is very broad, and it is questionable as to whether it is relevant to a security report. These forms are certainly intrusive to third parties. The committee has made recommendations&mdash;not definite recommendations&mdash;on this matter in its report. I think the chairman of the committee would agree with me in saying that this matter is obviously something which the committee would want to monitor in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Privacy Commissioner told the committee that he was concerned that very junior officers sometimes carried out questioning using the personal particulars questionnaire. I guess it adds insult to injury when senior officers of the Public Service are questioned by junior officers on quite personal matters, such as whether they have a fiance or whether their fiance has relatives overseas. The committee recommended that all security interviews within agencies be conducted by appropriately qualified, trained and experienced officers. I think that is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the committee's report to the House. It is a good report which deals with a very difficult issue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the 39th Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference, held in Cyprus, and to Malta and Germany from 3 to 23 September 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation to the 39th Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference in Cyprus, and to Malta and Germany in September last year, was significant in a number of ways. The Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference was attended by 247 delegates from 97 Commonwealth jurisdictions. Its theme was the role of the Commonwealth in world economic development and its impact on the environment; the strengthening of parliamentary democracy; world security; and the safeguarding of human rights. Commonwealth of Australia branch delegates contributed to all plenary and panel sessions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A highlight of the conference was the address by His Excellency Chief Emeka Anyaoku, on the theme `The Commonwealth and inalienable rights'. The full text of his address is an appendix to the report I have just presented. It was a memorable speech, particularly on African issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CPA's formal decision making body, the general assembly, was especially significant in that it adopted a new constitution. The former constitution had been in effect since 1977 and had been much amended, leading to problems of interpretation and questions as to its consistency. The Commonwealth of Australia branch, and particularly former President Kerry Sibraa, had put considerable effort into the development of the draft. Our delegation was successful in persuading the general assembly to agree to certain amendments to the proposed constitution. The adoption of the constitution, as amended, was received with utmost satisfaction by all concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assembly also elected the next chairman of the CPA executive committee. Mr Colin Shepherd, a member of the UK House of Commons, was successful and congratulations are extended to him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation's visit to Malta was the first official visit by a delegation from the Australian parliament. Australia's relations with Malta at the parliamentary, governmental and citizen levels remain excellent, enhanced somewhat by the large numbers in Australia of Maltese-born citizens and those claiming Maltese ancestry. Discussions were held with the Maltese President, the Prime Minister, the foreign minister, the Leader of the Opposition, central political party representatives and leading figures in industry and commerce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The end result from the delegation's view was a most successful renewal of ties with the Maltese House of Representatives and review of our bilateral relationship, and an exchange of views on a wide range of political, economic and social issues, both domestic and international. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The visit to Germany was the first by a parliamentary delegation since the 1989 unification. The timing was interesting in that the commencement of the visit coincided with the Hamburg state elections in what was described by one participant in the delegation's program as a marathon period of elections. In Hamburg the Social Democratic Party lost its absolute majority but retained power with the support of the Greens. The Christian Democratic Union vote fell to 25 per cent and a right wing extremist candidate failed to be elected by only 0.2 per cent. Some observers saw the result as a protest vote against the major parties and a major shift in politics resulting from changes in eastern Europe, and as an indication of Germany in microcosm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contact the delegation enjoyed with a wide cross-section of political, legislative, and executive leaders, with leading industry and commerce figures, and in legislator to legislator discussions, gave the delegation a sound awareness of the challenges and practical considerations flowing from the 1989 unification, particularly the enormous resources required to bring the former GDR states to parity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The visit provided members of the delegation with the opportunity to advance strongly Australia's position on the need for a speedy conclusion to the Uruguay Round and to assert our support for the Blair House agreement as a minimum position. The opportunity was also taken to urge greater access to Australian exports, particularly coal and agricultural products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation had the opportunity to sample some of Germany's cultural delights, including a German performance of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Phantom of the Opera</EMPHASIS> in Hamburg, a modernistic performance in the Semper Opera House, Dresden, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hommage to Rachmaninoff</EMPHASIS>, and a tour of the `Old Masters Gallery' in Dresden, encompassing works by Rembrandt, Rubens, van Dyck and others&mdash;a very memorable experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thanks are extended to our hosts and to the Australian representatives in Cyprus, Malta and Germany. The hardworking staff of the parliamentary relations office as ever did everything within their power to ensure the visit's success. Thanks are also extended to the delegation members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also extend the delegation's thanks to the Deputy Clerk of the House, Mr Ian Harris, and Mr Fred Peppinck, Senior Adviser to the then President of the Senate, for their invaluable assistance to the delegation. It was an extremely hardworking delegation, punctual and ever committed to presenting a unified representation of Australia's position on specific issues. Particular thanks are due to Kerry Sibraa and Brian Archer, who have since left the Senate, for their leadership and individual contributions. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a real privilege to be a part of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the 39th Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference. It was my first experience in representing the Australian parliament overseas and I certainly found the visit informative, interesting and enjoyable. The hospitality extended to us was always generous and we were made to feel very welcome wherever we went. As the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) mentioned, the central cause of the visit was to attend the Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference in Cyprus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet again that conference demonstrated what a diverse group of nations the British Commonwealth of Nations has become. It is no longer, if it ever was, just a group of traditional English-speaking, prosperous, white democracies. The majority of delegates these days come from countries that are black, Indian, Third World or African. Surprisingly, a number of French speaking parliaments are also represented at the conference. It was an excellent meeting which certainly did a great deal to further extend the bonds of goodwill that exist between Commonwealth countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose not many world shattering resolutions are ever carried or dealt with at these types of gatherings but I thought the final communique was a bit of a disappointment. I think it showed very little reflection of what actually happened at the conference. It was full of politically correct language, but I could not help get the feeling that it was written before the conference started and that what actually occurred was not allowed to influence the final communique too much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the opportunity to see something of Cyprus but, even without our own visual observations, the so-called Cyprus problem, as it is euphemistically described, was ever present in the debates. The division of Cyprus into Greek and Turkish sectors is a tragedy which falls very heavily on the lives of the local people. The Australian police force that is currently fulfilling a role there is very highly thought of. From time to time there have been suggestions that Australia should withdraw that group of men and women. I can assure the parliament that such an action would not be well received by the people of Cyprus. Their role is appreciated and there is a desire to maintain that United Nations presence to ensure peace and security between the Greek and Turkish sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The visit to Malta was also a wonderful experience. As was previously mentioned, it is perhaps surprising that this was the first visit ever by an Australian parliamentary delegation to Malta. There are lots of ties between our two countries. Virtually every Maltese family can tell stories of their relatives in Australia. We were told on more than one occasion that there were more Maltese in Australia than in Malta. Some of those people who came here years ago are now returning to their home country as the Maltese economy improves and it is now a little more difficult to obtain work in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are close ties between Australia and Malta. We were warmly welcomed in Malta and had the opportunity to meet all of the leading political and business figures of that country. There is a strong desire in Malta to strengthen links with Australia. In particular, the Maltese regularly raise their desire to have air links between Malta and Australia to facilitate a more appropriate method of travel. The country has a magnificent history. It has been a fortress for something like 2,000 years, strategically located no matter what conflict there seems to have been in the world, and its heroic people have certainly filled a very prominent role in the history of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The journey to Germany enabled us to learn something about the enormous impact of reuniting East and West Germany. The East Germans, who have lived in a sheltered economy for a long time, are now exposed to the rigours of international competition. It is not just ordinary international competition, because it is now in direct association with West Germany, one of the most vigorous economies in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The East Germans are not finding that experience to be all plain sailing. There are many difficulties, but they are adjusting and there is a great deal of confidence that the new Germany will be stronger as a result. I think it was a very useful exchange. I would join my colleagues in thanking the leader of the delegation, Senator Kerry Sibraa, as well as Ian Harris, Fred Peppinck and others associated with assisting the delegation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The report that I have just presented is the third review of an audit report that I have tabled this year. On a previous occasion I emphasised how important it was for the parliament to take careful note of audit reports and for it to call on government departments to explain how they are going to overcome any deficiencies identified by the auditors. In this case I am very pleased to report that the agency concerned, the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency, CEPA, has taken a positive, indeed pro-active, approach to the audit report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Undertaken during 1992 by the Australian National Audit Office, the efficiency audit was intended to determine how the efficiency and effectiveness of the Commonwealth's environmental impact assessment processes could be improved. CEPA is to be commended for its initiative in developing a detailed strategic approach to implement the auditors' recommendations. However, the committee is concerned that CEPA's effort has not been matched by other departments and agencies with responsibilities under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 20 years since the act was introduced, Australia has undergone some dramatic changes. The emphasis on conservation, preservation and protection of the environment has taken on new dimensions. Environmental impact assessment has become a routine part of decision making but, as the audit revealed and as CEPA's subsequent actions confirmed, there is considerable scope for reform of the administration of the environmental impact assessment process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the features of the act&mdash;and it can be argued that it is a deficiency&mdash;is that departments and agencies other than CEPA have to make the initial assessment about whether a proposed action is likely to give rise to significant environmental impact. The main environmental impact assessment provisions of the act are triggered only if this initial assessment identifies potential impacts. This procedure means that the so-called action agencies that make this initial assessment need staff who are knowledgeable in the EIA process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most important findings emerging from the committee's review of the audit is the pressing need for information and training in the EIA process. At present there is a notable lack of expertise among officers in other agencies which are involved in environmental impact assessment. CEPA has developed a comprehensive draft operational manual which should be of considerable assistance to other agencies in writing their own in-house manuals and organising their own staff development programs. CEPA will take a leadership role in developing appropriate education strategies to increase the level of expertise of all environmental impact assessment practitioners, but the committee firmly believes that this task must be a shared one. The development of greater expertise within action agencies is likely to encourage the integration of environmental decisions with general administrative processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To assist further in the education process, CEPA is proposing to set up an environmental impact assessment practitioners' network that is designed to bring together a cross-section of people who are participants in the EIA process and other interested parties, such as industry representatives, academics and conservation organisations. The purpose of the network will be to facilitate the sharing, evaluation and dissemination of information and to promote stronger relations between all parties. The committee has recommended that all departments and agencies with responsibilities under the act support the proposed network and demonstrate their support by allocating adequate resources to ensure its success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another deficiency in the act is the lack of provision for the monitoring of compliance with conditions imposed on developments and for assessing the actual impacts of projects once they become operational. CEPA commissioned a consultancy to evaluate and report on the best options for monitoring approved projects. This is another area where the response of other agencies will be important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that memoranda of understanding between the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories and all government agencies that make environmentally significant decisions have been much underrated and underutilised. They serve a valuable purpose in assisting agencies in the important task of evaluating the environmental significance of proposals. They do this by establishing appropriate procedures for determining environmental significance, by providing guidance as to which proposals should be referred for consideration and by ensuring that other agencies are aware of proposals. The committee believes that it is important for the parliament to be aware of progress in the negotiation of memoranda of understanding. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> It has recommended that DEST provide details of all proposed memoranda, complete or not, in its annual report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The audit report recommended the introduction of a consulting fee as a means to force action agencies to improve their capacity to make decisions about the environmental significance of proposals. However, the committee believes it is important that open communication channels exist and advice and support be freely available throughout the process as decisions made by other agencies may have significant environmental implications. The committee proposes to continue to consult with CEPA and to monitor the performance of the agencies that need to participate in the implementation of the audit findings to ensure that the opportunities for reform created by the audit are not wasted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the EIA process has some shortcomings and unnecessary complexities and loopholes, it is a valuable tool in the protection of the environment. The recent mushroom growth of mobile phone towers is a cause of dismay to many not only because of the visual ugliness and inappropriateness of many of the locations but also principally because of the lack of consultation or forewarning. The builders of these eyesores, which are the three carriers&mdash;Optus, Telecom and Vodaphone&mdash;are all but exempt from environmental impact considerations and can continue to build towers anywhere they like. The normal application of environmental impact assessment procedures would have forced these operators to consider alternatives such as the co-location of facilities and would have required public consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank members of the committee secretariat for their work on this report, particularly Gabrielle Jess, who did much of the initial research, and Ian Dundas, the committee secretary, who oversaw the preparation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;This is the third in a recent series of reports by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts into audit reports on a number of Commonwealth programs. This report is the least controversial of them all. While there is some criticism of the way in which some programs have been operated, generally there is agreement that the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency is trying hard and is serious about implementing its responsibilities. However, there is some question about whether other departments and sectors of government adequately recognise their obligations in this area and have responded appropriately to the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I join the chairman of the committee in thanking the committee staff for the assistance which they have provided in preparing this report and in the other work of the committee. I also compliment the chairman on the very effective way in which he chairs the committee's deliberations and generally brings us to a unanimous finding in our reports. That has certainly been the case in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Environment Protection (Impact Of Proposals) Act was passed by the parliament in 1974. Under this act, Commonwealth projects likely to affect the environment are subject to examination on their potential environmental impact. The review is not merely to be associated with proposed capital works or projects of that nature; it can also deal with proposals, negotiations and agreements, including agreements with the various states and territories, decisions and recommendations that are made by various government agencies or other proposals involving the incurring of expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the act is intended to be very broad based. Ministers actioning proposals are required to initiate the processes of the act. That has clearly not always occurred in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency is responsible for administering the various aspects of this act. It has sought to guarantee these processes through the establishment of a number of formal memoranda of understanding. There have been negotiations with various agencies as to the way in which environmental impact assessments will occur whenever proposals are initiated. Even at this stage&mdash;20 years after the implementation of the act&mdash;only 22 of these memoranda are in existence. Some of them are with agencies that have subsequently ceased to exist. I refer briefly to page 10 of the report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation commented on the delays in negotiating MOUs in 1979 and 1985. On the second occasion, the committee reported that it was `appalled' that only two MOUs had been agreed in the six years since the 1979 report, bringing the total to eight. Some progress has been made in negotiating MOUs since 1985, but it appears that departments and agencies are still reluctant to finalise negotiations, despite the potential to clarify administrative complexities and streamline the EIA processes.</PARA>
<PARA>The progress in this area has, to say the least, certainly been slow. Questions need to be asked as to what level of commitment there is in many government departments and agencies towards the environmental impact assessment process. It has to be regarded as a pretty half-hearted response that in 20 years so few agencies seem to have put in place appropriate mechanisms to ensure that their proposals and projects do not have adverse environmental impacts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> CEPA is clearly taking its responsibilities seriously. It is to be commended for the initiatives that it is taking to seek to strengthen the procedures and to ensure that they cover a wider range of activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The audit report makes 19 recommendations, 17 of which have been agreed to by CEPA and one with qualified agreement. The qualified agreement is in a matter dealing with fees. In this area, ironically the committee came to the conclusion that it disagreed with the Auditor-General's recommendation. It suggested that fees should not be charged by CEPA. Clearly, if there is some reluctance for agencies to be involved in this process, they will be more reluctant if they have to pay fees for the process. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that, if there is to be a fee schedule, government agencies and departments will clearly be less likely to seek the advice and assistance of CEPA than if the advice is handed out freely and on request. There needs to be a general encouragement of government agencies and departments to ensure that they fulfil their responsibilities under this process. CEPA needs to be given support in its endeavours to ensure that its responsibilities under the act are fulfilled. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In an address to the committee in Melbourne on 10 April 1994, my friend and colleague the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increasing use of single voyage permits has provided flexibility and new opportunities for shippers&mdash;opportunities that will see more than 400 cargo permits issued this financial year. This represents a 10-fold increase since 1989.</PARA>
<PARA>I rest my case. My colleague the minister seems to think somehow that this increase in issue of single voyage permits is good news. It might be good news for those who are in the quick quid market, but it is not good news for Australian shipping, for Australians in general or indeed for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Single voyage permits are supposed to be issued when there is no Australian ship able to do the work; that is, no Australian ship standing by waiting to do the work. It is in that case that a single voyage permit is issued. Before the department issues the permit, it is supposed to contact the unions and satisfy itself that those ships meet all Australian standards. The issue of single voyage permits is now nothing more than a farce. The department has been lax and has not ensured that those vessels meet even the minimum Australian standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the clever country we are unbelievably slow learners. It is only good luck, not good management, that one of those ageing rust buckets trundling its way through the Great Barrier Reef has not gone down. When it does, as inevitably it will, when our premier tourist attraction is awash with sticky oil or the sea is polluted with one of the cocktails of chemicals that ships are increasingly carrying, it will be too late to then say that these ships should never have been permitted to ply their wares along the coast of Australia. What is happening off Cape Town in South Africa as I now speak could be repeated off the Great Barrier Reef any day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That's right.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is indeed right. I have told honourable members before in this chamber about my inspection of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">APJ Anand</EMPHASIS>. Last year this ship was issued with a single voyage permit to carry barley from Albany in Western Australia to Gladstone in Queensland. On arrival in Gladstone it was found to have 148 major defects. I happened to be in Brisbane at that time and I was contacted by the unions to go and inspect that ship. I went to Gladstone to inspect it and although I was not permitted to board the ship I had discussions there with some of the crew and others about it. If this ship had met all the requirements for Australian coastal shipping, if it had even been inspected, if those in the department had got off their butts for once in their life and inspected this ship as they were supposed to have done, how come it had 148 major defects? This ship was to go from Gladstone to Mackay to pick up a cargo of sugar for some Asian port.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that these ships being issued with single voyage permits in the main do not comply with Australian standards. Despite the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's extra vigilance since the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report, too many of these ships are not being inspected and are not meeting minimum Australian standards. The maritime unions are supposed to be contacted before these single voyage permits are issued, but they have not been contacted. As late as this morning when I contacted the Maritime Union, there had been absolutely no attempt to contact it before any single voyage permit had been issued. I would like to know why this Commonwealth department is not carrying out its requirements under legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Single voyage permits are nothing more than an attempt to weaken cabotage in this country. In most of the world cabotage is closely protected, but the issue of single voyage permits is a way around this. It is the way those opposite would go as they would open our coast to the dangerous rust buckets of the world. It is because of the threat of cabotage and the dangers to our marine environment that I strongly oppose the issue of single voyage permits. The issue of single voyage permits should only be sanctioned in extreme cases, not as now, by the minister's own admission, where the issue is a mere formality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Continuing with the issuing of single voyage permits and allowing the foreign rust buckets to carry our cargo around the ports of Australia will make it even more easy to sell off the Australian National Line, which is something some, even on my side of politics unfortunately, would condone. To sell ANL would be extreme economic folly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The world's shipping fleet is ageing. Even if we commence replacement building today, within 10 years there will be a shortage of ships and, perhaps even more serious, there will be a shortage of trained personnel to crew these ships. But what is a clever country's response to this challenge? By issuing single voyage permits we are increasingly allowing foreign flag vessels to carry cargo around Australia, thus denying those opportunities and revenue to our own line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an undignified scramble we are touting what should be the pride of every Australian, ANL, to bidders both locally and internationally. Instead of selling off our heritage and our asset, we should be looking at the injection of funds to ANL and be looking to building our own ships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Denmark, with a wage structure higher than that of Australia, can build ships for the world, why can we not with the use of modern technology build our own replacement ships? Of course, we could do that. The only thing lacking is the will. As an island continent, few nations are as dependent on shipping as Australia, yet to our shame we carry less than five per cent of our cargo in Australian flagged and crewed ships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once we sell off ANL, other shippers such as BHP would flag out. We could see the situation of a BHP ship registered in Malta, officered by Filipinos and with ratings from Burma. For us to retain credibility in the international forums dealing with shipping, such as IMO, it is essential that we maintain our own flagged and crewed ships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition in this place makes a lot of the Australian flag. We come in here today and find that members of the opposition have gone back to the childish prank of having the Australian flag on their desks. If they are so keen to have Australian flags on their desks, why are they so ashamed to see Australian flags on Australian ships? Why do we not hear them then? They come in here and put these flags, perhaps made in Taiwan, on their desks, but when people like me and the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) stand up here and argue for Australian flagged shipping, what do we hear? Why do those opposite not want to see the Australian flag on Australian ships? They talk about national pride. How could we have more pride than to have our own flag on our own ships? So get your flags off your desks, you fools, and support the idea of having the Australian flag on Australian ships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dramatic increase in the numbers of single voyage permits issued over the last few years is, I would suggest, no cause for celebration. The rules in existence concerning the issue of these permits must be enforced. Let us hope that in a few years there is a decline in the numbers of single voyage permits issued and that this cargo is being carried where it rightly belongs: in Australian flagged and crewed ships. Then the minister, I hope, will be as gleeful as he was at that meeting in Melbourne in April of this year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was quite a performance. I am utterly confused as to what the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) was really trying to tell us. I agree with him when he said that single voyage permits are available only when there is no Australian ship to do the job. I agree with him on that. But then we heard him attacking the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton). Is this the sign of a major split in the government? Are we finally seeing the Left and the Right about to come to blows over the single voyage permit policy?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member was not happy with just attacking his minister. He then went on to attack the government department. He said that it was not administering the policy that the minister has announced and has been supported by the government for some years now. So he found that the administration is no good. Maybe he ought to go into the caucus room when ministers meet tomorrow and give them a good lecture. Some of them might be quite interested in what he has to say. Then we had highly emotional talk about what might happen to the Great Barrier Reef. Like all honourable members, I would do anything reasonable and possible to stop pollution on the Great Barrier Reef. It has not happened. The honourable member then cited the example of a grain ship having major defects as though this is proof that an oil tanker is suddenly going to go around to the Great Barrier Reef and do the unthinkable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then heard some highly emotional and quite fantastic examples of what may or may not happen if a rust bucket were to go down. But, as the honourable member knows only too well, Australia is well noted in world shipping circles for enforcing considerably higher standards than some other countries do. When he makes comments such as `No doubt, the majority of ships do not comply with Australian standards', we have to question what he is saying about most ships that come into Australian ports. He knows only too well that not only are they well run; they are also well maintained and well serviced. He can always provide some exceptions, but he knows full well that Australia does insist on much higher standards. To suggest that the removal of cabotage creates an `open run for rust buckets', as he puts it, is just utter rubbish. If he wants to make a decent case, he ought to have much sounder facts to back up his argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was even more confused when he started talking about the Australian National Line. He attacked the government because it was supposedly going to sell the ANL and then he said that it should not be sold. I ask the honourable member: what is going on? Is he not a member of the government? He has attacked it on the single voyage permits; he has accused it of not enforcing the law as it has been passed through this parliament; he attacked his minister; and then he attacked the Australian Labor Party on its proposal to sell the Australian National Line. I wonder why he remains a member of the party. Has he ever thought of exercising his rights and showing people that he is fair dinkum about it and resigning from the Labor Party?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He gave an extraordinary performance. He attacked the government and then he did the usual thing that is done in the Labor Party: he turned around and blamed the opposition for it all. It is just marvellous. How long has the Labor Party been in government? The honourable member said that it is the opposition's fault. Then, just to make sure that we did not get diverted too much, he started to talk about the Australian flags on the desks of opposition members. He ought to be very proud of the Australian flag, as are most Australians. If he were to look at the polls, he would see that the majority of Australians happen to be rather proud of the Australian flag. So, if I were him, I would not spend too much time attacking the flag. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to the main point raised by the honourable member: single voyage permits. I said at the beginning of my speech that single voyage permits are available only if an Australian ship is not there to do the job or if an Australian ship is not adequate to meet the needs of the port or ports that would be used. One other occasion when single voyage permits would be available is if the minister is satisfied that it is desirable and in the public interest that unlicensed ships be allowed to engage in that trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, the minister is unlikely to do that, but there are occasions when he might, for example, if the owner or the agent of a ship were to offer to carry cargo freight free on behalf of a recognised amateur sporting group or a charity. The minister would then obviously have to be satisfied that it met this criterion. Another example is if some cargo handling equipment were being relocated from one stevedoring facility to another. It is true, as the honourable member has pointed out, that the number of single voyage permits has increased. In fact, it has risen from 72 in 1982-83 to 307 in 1992-93. That increase over that 10-year period has been under a Labor administration. There is clearly an indicated need, otherwise this would not have been occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the few minutes available to me, I would like to turn to an area in which I think the honourable member ought to be directing some of his attention: the comparative costs of shipping in Australia. I would like to start with comparisons of some of the port charges. I have an index of comparative port costs, which I seek leave to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8H4">Mr HAWKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. We ought to be looking at some of the costs involved in shipping in Australia to see where Australia is lagging behind. If we look at this survey, if we take as a base rate the port of Melbourne as 100 per cent, we find that Sydney's costs are 79 per cent; Fremantle, 76 per cent; Adelaide, 56 per cent; and Brisbane, 50 per cent. But, if we compare the costs with those of a couple of ports in New Zealand, we find that Auckland's costs are only 35 per cent&mdash;about one-third of the cost of the port of Melbourne&mdash;and that Wellington's costs are 25 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest to the honourable member that he ought to be attacking his government and his minister about tackling some of these. We do not have to just look across the Tasman; we could also look at the costs in Europe. Hamburg is more expensive but Rotterdam is considerably cheaper than Melbourne, and Tilbury is cheaper than that. If we go to other ports in Europe, we find that Fos-Sur-Mer's port costs are 54 per cent of those of Melbourne; Zeebrugge, 44 per cent; Barcelona, 31 per cent; and Lisbon, 26 per cent. The honourable member ought to take this pretty seriously if he is concerned about making Australia more competitive when it comes to shipping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also refer the honourable member to a report published by the Business Council of Australia just over a month ago, which makes some comparisons of other costs. It found that, for example, the manning costs for Australian dry bulk vessels were over 40 per cent greater than those of the lowest comparable country using a national crew, which&mdash;before the honourable member jumps in&mdash;happened to be a UK crew. As pointed out in this report, Australian crews incurred higher indirect manning costs&mdash;that includes leave provisions and on-costs, such as training and recruiting&mdash;than coastal crews from any of the other selected overseas countries. It also pointed out another matter which the honourable member ought to be taking very seriously: the costs of fuel for Australia were the highest of the selected countries. Why? It is mainly because the high excise tax significantly inflates the purchase price of fuel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member ought to be looking at all those costs very seriously before he comes in with his emotional case about single voyage permits. If he is serious about trying to make the Australian National Line and other Australian shipping companies competitive with the rest of the world, then he ought to look at some of these costs, many of which are under the control of this government. I think that, far from being concerned about single voyage permits, he should direct himself to these other issues, which are considerably more significant in terms of making the cost of exporting out of this country more expensive than it need otherwise be and, hence, not only increasing the cost of our exports, but also getting a decent figure for our balance of payments just that much harder. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) tried hard, but he had not put a lot of effort into his speech. He might be aware that we have just reduced excise costs on fuel. However, port charges are a state responsibility, so he will need to speak to some of his state colleagues about them. The other point that needs attention drawn to it is the good level of shipping safety that he was talking about. I refer him to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The international economic climate in combination with an excess of tonnage has created a situation where current freight rates are placing considerable pressure on ship operating costs and are insufficient to justify the maintenance of existing ships let alone the building of new ones.</PARA>
<PARA>It later states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has received evidence that the IMO convention standards are sufficient, the problem is non compliance with those standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The failure of some flag states to comply with international conventions is the major impediment to improving ship safety.</PARA>
<PARA>The report also states something that is very relevant to single voyage permits:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It became apparent that the crews of many bulk carriers are inexperienced and lack any formal training. The increasing use of crew members from non traditional maritime nations on very low wages was put forward as a major reason for the decline in crewing standards . . . The Committee received evidence that on many occasions crews were underpaid and underfed with working and living conditions not meeting the minimums set down in ILO Convention 147.</PARA>
<PARA>The report further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has received evidence that crew sizes approved by some flag states may have been reduced to the level where the crew would not be able to adequately cope with a disaster situation. This reduction in the size of crews in combination with the lack of experience and training of many crews poses a most serious threat to ship safety.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a very important issue. I notice that the honourable member for Wannon has left because of his rather under-resourced speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member is quite correct in terms of the massive increase in single voyage permits. Whilst we are being constructively critical&mdash;I thought he was being an apologist for government policy; a most interesting turn-up of events&mdash;the important issue is that, if we allow a massive increase in single voyage permits without effective monitoring, we indeed will have a situation of disaster, as outlined by the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). It will be too late when the Barrier Reef, which is right off the coast of my electorate, is awash with oil. Unfortunately, we need to be pro-active rather than reactive in these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that the honourable member for Wannon raised was manning costs. It is true that on some comparative statistics we do have higher levels, but we also have one of the best trained and skilled maritime industrial personnel groups. That has been a tribute to this government's reform of the shipping industry. I acknowledge the role of the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), a former minister for transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the Bureau of Industry Economics on coastal shipping, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">International performance indicators</EMPHASIS>, states that the average crew level of the Australian fleet was reduced from 28 to less than 21 and is now below the average of OECD vessels visiting Australia. So, with the commitment of the maritime unions, we have made a major restructuring and, at the same time, an increase in training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that it is most important, given this improved record over the 11-year life of this government, that we now consolidate our position and not sell off ANL. It is absolutely vital that we maintain our own shipping industry, jobs and commitment, and not cede sovereignty to other nations. This is a crucial industry for this country. It provides $7 billion worth of shipping in imports and exports. We need to maintain the value of this industry in the country. Any minor savings that may be made would be fully offset by our balance of trade in terms of shipping costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is vital for the standard of crewing that we maintain an Australian presence in this industry. That is absolutely vital for the protection of Australia's coastline, from an environmental point of view and also in terms of our own national sovereignty.

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;and they are just as dangerous one kilometre out of Australia's waters as they were one kilometre inside</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Navigation Act&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is where we come to the law of the land, which this government is supposed to administer&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">gives wide powers to Federal Government over all ships entering Australian waters and ports</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;the same powers that it exercises over Australian vessels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 189 of the Act states that</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"All ships shall be liable to inspection and survey"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Note that this applies to all ships, not just Australian ships.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The power of the Australian Authority under the Act is comprehensive:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 190AA.(1) provides that</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"A surveyor may at any reasonable time go on board a ship and inspect the ship and any part of the ship, including the hull, boilers, machinery and equipment of the ship, and may require the certificate of competency of the master or of any officer of the ship, or any certificate or other document relating to the ship, to be produced to him." </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Navigation Act also defines what is unseaworthy and substandard in Sections 207 and 207A.</PARA>
<PARA>This is already in the act. The government could be administering it, if it chose to. What is the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) doing about it? The shadow minister further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A vessel is only seaworthy if "it is in a fit state as to condition of hull and equipment, boilers and machinery, stowage of ballast or cargo, number and qualifications of crew including officers, and in every other respect, to encounter the ordinary perils of the voyage then entered upon."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the ship is under foreign certification, then it is unseaworthy if "the condition of the ship or of its equipment does not correspond substantially with the particulars of that certificate or any of those certificates."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is substandard if it is, for the purposes of the Act, "seaworthy, but conditions on board are clearly hazardous to safety or health."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act provides for the provisional detention, and then the detention (which can be indefinite, unless the faults are remedied) of a ship that is unseaworthy or substandard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act applies to vessels of all flags, not only to Australian vessels.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In proposing this motion, I ask a simple question of the government: who is more fiscally responsible and better able to spend the hard earned money of Australian taxpayers and manage government services&mdash;the states or Canberra? I have always been of the view that the trend to the centralisation of power in Canberra is anathema to the ideal of giving Australians better and more efficient government services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look closely at the government's 1994-95 budget papers, the Working Nation statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and historic trends, we immediately see a worrying trend emerging in this country. It is a trend that sees the Commonwealth government hell-bent on strangling the states' ability to fund services at the grassroots level and thereby vesting more control over expenditure in Canberra. It is obvious that the government is determined to hitch a piggyback ride on the long suffering states with regard to fiscal responsibility while becoming ever more burdensome itself through its orgy of spending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Willis), as well as their predecessors, have often stated that micro-economic reform is primarily the responsibility of the states. Why will the Prime Minister not let the states get on with it? The problem with micro-economic reform for the Labor Party is that it is sandbagged by an ideology which inevitably ends up in increased spending when factional infighting causes the government to attempt to placate as many minorities and factional subgroupings as possible. I had to smile a little when I read the comments of the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns). He talked about the way minority groups have been accommodated by the federal government in recent years. We need to consider how easily the government backs down to minority groups when it is put under pressure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the budget forward estimates, two things become clear. The Keating government has committed itself to a huge spending increase which will result in an effective deficit of $17 billion in 1994-95 after allowance is made for major asset sales and provision for GBE superannuation. The second aspect that comes to light is that the government is substantially using the improving fiscal performance of the states to fund this spending spree. What message is the government sending to the people of this country? It appears to be quite clear. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Assistant Treasurer is at the table and is making absurd comments as usual. The government is saying that more spending is needed and we need not worry about the low level of domestic savings&mdash;the level of household savings is predicted to fall even further during 1994-95&mdash;or the rapidly rising level and cost of public debt. As we all know, it is a national scandal that the Commonwealth debt is forecast to rise by 15 per cent to $95 billion during the next financial year. Interest payments on this debt alone will increase by 29 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This message of big spending at any cost runs counter to the message that the states are rightly trying to give to their constituents. On the one hand, we have states pushing the doctrine of careful and responsible financial management; on the other we have a federal government throwing money around like confetti. What are the people of Australia to make out of this? The federal government should be leading the way in fiscal reform. Instead this government is abrogating any responsibility it has for fiscal leadership. To rub salt into the wounds, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are relying on states' revenue to fund the massively increasing levels of expenditure to which I have just referred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The states have largely done their part in turning Australia around economically. The budget papers forward estimates minus asset sales show likely surpluses in Western Australia, Queensland and Victoria. This is due mainly to the effects of increasing stamp duty and other fixed charges rising on the back of improving economies in these states. Not content to sponge off the added revenue generated by the states, the federal government has employed even more sinister ways of bringing the states to heel regarding fiscal policy. I refer to the government's continued campaign to force state governments to spend existing Commonwealth grants in areas targeted by the federal government. It has resulted in the level of untied grants to the states from Canberra decreasing and the level of tied or specific purpose grants increasing as a percentage of all grants. This is further evidence of the trend by Labor to neuter the states and vest further control in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, historically, in the decade before Labor came to government, tied grants made up just over 32 per cent of all grants. A decade after Labor was elected, tied grants now form 43 per cent of all grants. This quite clearly hits at the very centre of the relationship between the states and the federal government. This trend must be reversed through the sensible allocation of more control to the states where the funds are administered more closely to the community which they affect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind those opposite with short memories that the 1990 Special Premiers Conference stated its objective to return levels of tied grants to 1980s levels. The Prime Minister has not only ignored this, but also embarked on a further course of emasculating the states. The average Australian may well have difficulty in distinguishing between tied and untied grants, but the fact remains that the federal government is increasingly using the twin levers of tied grants and reduced funding to squeeze those states that it sees as the enemy. By this, I mean the Liberal state governments that have taken on the task of righting the dreadful financial mess-ups of their predecessor Labor administrations, and they are succeeding spectacularly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that in question time today the opposition raised the issue of the number of former failed premiers of Labor governments who have been given taxpayer funded jobs by the federal government. We even have a failed Labor premier from Western Australia now holding a very senior portfolio in the federal government. I must say that if the history of her government is any guide, then we are in for a woeful time in relation to health policy. As if the government is not satisfied with ripping control off the states and entrenching centralism in Canberra, it has embarked on a concerted campaign in recent years to hand over control to committees of the United Nations and to Geneva through the ILO. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member might well scoff. He does not mind that the Prime Minister has handed over more power to foreign bodies than has ever occurred before in the history of this Commonwealth. The Prime Minister pretends to be a nationalist and patriot but he has been steadily handing over power to institutions such as the UN Human Rights Committee. What an absolute joke, what a parody it is that there are representatives on the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations whose human rights records in their own countries are absolutely abysmal, yet we have to kowtow to those people through the external treaty provisions of the constitution. This federal government has signed away so much of our sovereignty to overseas bodies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This country needs governments to get closer to the people, not further away; not in Geneva, not overseas, but here. It needs to get closer to the people that governments are supposed to serve. The states that have led the way in micro-economic reform in this country, states like the one I represent, Western Australia, have adopted a tight fiscal policy which will see them post a significant surplus for the year 1994-95 according to the forward estimates in Budget Paper No. 1. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation now is that the people who actually generate the money through the states do not get to use it in anywhere near the proportion which would be considered as fair and likely to contribute to an efficient or effective economic recovery. This is all the more worrying when one considers that the states' funds are targeted at real community services such as health, education and law and order. The moneys generated by the states and leached off by the federal government are in many respects expended on intangibles with dubious and often straight out non-existent benefits for the taxpayers who provided the funds in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion does not necessarily call for a bigger handout to the states from Canberra. It requires that the federal government allow the states greater control over the increasing funds that they generate. The big spending nature of the budget and the relative reduction in grants to the states, as outlined in the budget papers, show that the federal government is using the states' improving performances as a pool of capital to fund its own uncontrolled expenditure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to oppose the motion moved by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing). The motion itself and his contribution are essentially based on faulty facts, faulty analysis and faulty logic. The first paragraph of the honourable member's formal motion refers to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Willis) having argued that much of micro-economic reform is the responsibility of the states. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer, and this government, say that micro-economic reform is a responsibility of all governments in Australia&mdash;local, state and federal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth has been the leader in micro-economic reform in this country over the last 10 years. A good example of that&mdash;one the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), who is at the table, is closely aware of and involved in&mdash;is the recent decision of the meeting of Commonwealth and state heads of government in respect of competition policy and the Hilmer report. Once again, with this micro-economic reform, the states were dragged to the table by the Commonwealth. We say there is a responsibility at all levels of government but we also say that the federal government has been the key mover of micro-economic reform in this country over the last decade. Paragraph (b) of the motion of the honourable member for Moore states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in order for the states to carry out that reform they must get a far greater share of revenue from the economic recovery;</PARA>
<PARA>This assumes that micro-economic reform is linked to more revenue. That is not necessarily the case. For example, one of the key micro-economic reforms that the government is supporting under its access to justice plan is reform of the legal profession. We do not need a greater handout to any of the states to ensure that we have competition in and reform of the legal profession in the states. This notion that the states must somehow get a greater share of revenue to effect micro-economic reform is based on faulty logic and faulty analysis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In paragraph (d) of the motion, the honourable member for Moore refers to Commonwealth revenue. Let us look at some of the facts and analysis. In the 1994-95 Budget Paper No. 1, table No. 1 at page 1.8 refers to Commonwealth budget outlays and revenue as a percentage of GDP. Let us find out who the big spenders and the big taxers are. In the last period of coalition government, outlays by the Commonwealth totalled 27.6 per cent of GDP in 1976-77 and, in the coalition's last year, 1982-83, they totalled 28.8 per cent. Commonwealth outlays totalled 25.2 per cent of GDP in 1990-91 and the projection for 1997-98 is 24.2 per cent. In terms of outlays, those opposite are the big spenders. Again in the last years of coalition government, in 1981-82 Commonwealth revenues totalled 25.9 per cent of GDP and, in 1982-83, 26.1 per cent. In 1990-91 revenue was 25.7 per cent of GDP, projected to fall in 1997-98 to 23.8 per cent. So we know who the big taxers and the big spenders are. It is the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at Commonwealth-state financial arrangements it is always very helpful to look at Budget Paper No. 3, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth financial relations with other levels of government</EMPHASIS>, which details the precise nature of Commonwealth-state relations and finances. The 1993-94 Budget Paper No. 3, at pages 20 and 21, gives a very good summary of the precise state of Commonwealth-state financial relations. At page 21 it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth's macroeconomic responsibilities necessarily require a focus on the overall financial position of the total public sector. Changes in the level of Commonwealth payments to the State/local sector are an important means by which the Commonwealth can seek to influence the stance of fiscal policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The States' response to Commonwealth policies is also very important in determining the overall economic impact of public sector activity. Hence, the stance of Commonwealth fiscal policy and, in particular, the level of payments to other tiers of government must reflect judgments as to the relevant capacity of each level of government to accommodate the policy adjustments that may be considered necessary. Charts 9 and 10 help to illustrate this by comparing real annual growth in Commonwealth and State total revenue with annual growth in State own-source revenue and net Commonwealth payments to the States.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The significant restraint in Commonwealth payments to the States exercised through the latter half of the 1980s . . . was aimed at ensuring that the burden of fiscal adjustment required to bolster national savings was borne equitably by all tiers of government, at a time when State own-source revenue was growing strongly. Chart 10 shows that the 1980s strong real growth in State own-source revenue was an important offset to real reductions in Commonwealth payments to the States</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This was reflected in the 1990 Premiers' Conference outcome, where FAGS for the three-year period 1991-92 to 1993-94 were guaranteed in real terms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the base level of FAGS, the Commonwealth provided a one-off increase of $168.7m in 1992-93. The 1993 Premiers' Conference confirmed this `real terms' guarantee for 1993-94.</PARA>
<PARA>The 1994 Premiers Conference decided to improve that position and place it on a per capita basis. The key point here&mdash;it is in the charts that I have referred to&mdash;is that all state and local sector sources of funding over the period 1961-62 to 1991-92 show a consistent trend line. State-own source revenue shows a consistent trend upwards. The mix is that when we find an increase in state-own source revenue we find a comparable reduction in net Commonwealth payments. But the key point is that there is a consistent trend line over a 30-year period for all governments, with state sources of funding on that consistent trend line. The argument that is put about the reduction of Commonwealth funds to the states is precisely balanced by the increase in the states' own revenue sources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1994-95 Budget Paper No. 3, at page 4, contains a very good summary of the decision made at the Premiers Conference in March 1994. The centrepiece of the agreement is the decision that financial assistance grants to the states be maintained in real per capita terms over the next three years&mdash;that is, FAGS will be adjusted each year not only for inflation, as has been recent practice, but also for total population growth. The level of general purpose payments to the states will be significantly higher than they would have received over the three years to 1996-97 if the real terms guarantee that applied from 1991-92 to 1993-94 had been extended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By 1996-97, on that formula, there is effectively a $450 million increase to the states. Some of the states, including Western Australia, have argued that the mix of Commonwealth-state finances ought to be calculated on the basis of a guaranteed share of revenue. If that had been the case, over the 1980s the states would have received about $2.3 billion less than they actually received under the previous and the current arrangements. That is because Commonwealth tax revenues are more volatile than state revenues. Had there been revenue sharing based on the 1990-91 proportions, the states would have received $2.3 billion less in financial assistance grants from the Commonwealth over the 1991-92 to 1993-94 period than they actually received under the real terms guarantee that was in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that analysis, the proposition put forward by the honourable member for Moore is not reflected by the budget papers and is not reflected by the facts. But what is the honourable member for Moore trying to do here? He is trying to give political succour to the Premier of Western Australia. Often I hear the Premier of Western Australia saying that Western Australia is a great exporting state and that therefore it is entitled to a greater share of Commonwealth revenue. Who is responsible for the massive increase in exports coming from Western Australia? That point is made very succinctly by Peter Roberts in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review,</EMPHASIS> in an article which appeared on Wednesday 22 June 1994 under the title `WA gets the export smarts'. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When I lived in Perth more than 15 years ago, the idea that Western Australia could be anything more than an export of raw materials was laughable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But since then the state has broadened its export base at the same time as boosting its international market share in core resources markets.</PARA>
<PARA>One can see the trend line in the graph depicted for elaborately transformed manufactures and manufactured exports in Western Australia over the 10- or 11-year period 1983-84 to 1993-94. That increase is a direct result of the policies of this government, making Australia more internationally competitive and, as part of that, ensuring that as a matter of national fiscal policy we have a clear and close mix of Commonwealth and state outlays. The propositions put forward by the honourable member for Moore do not bear up to rigorous analysis and simply reflect his efforts to give political succour to the Premier of Western Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) were to go back and take a look at the early history of his state and compare the revenue and expenditure of the states and the Commonwealth over that period, I think he would see a quite significant and alarming difference. This motion arose from the sheer hypocrisy of the federal government, which sees fit to preach the need for fiscal reform to state governments while clearly failing to reflect that advice in its own economic policy making. The fact is that the 1994-95 Commonwealth budget fails to deliver a fair share of revenue to the states, in that the forward estimate of the budget indicates that the Commonwealth revenue is expected to grow by 34.4 per cent in the period 1993-94 to 1997-98. However, the total grant to the states is expected to grow by only 8.4 per cent over the same period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1901 the colonies of Australia joined a federation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal system was set up to serve in an efficient manner the interests of Australian citizens&mdash;and not for cheap political gain.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is more relevant and alarming is the share of expenditure figures, with the Commonwealth collecting revenue far in excess of its expenditure needs. Only a part of the surplus is returned to the states. When the state expenditure exceeds its revenue, the problem of vertical fiscal imbalance arises. This was recognised as a significant problem by the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and the state premiers in 1990 when they called a special conference to discuss these problems. This move to redress the problem was scrapped by the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating). It is a problem also recognised as significant by an eminent Australian economist, Emeritus Professor Russell Mathews. In May he lectured on federal financial relations at the Australian National University and called for an end to the Commonwealth's virtual tax monopoly. </PARA>

To realise that total government from Canberra is a complete failure, one has only to go to a place like Christmas Island and look at the living standards that both the residents and the tourists have to put up with. There are disgraceful, unsealed, potholed roads and there is inattention to environmental management and funding that would never be tolerated on the mainland, including raw sewage being pumped into the harbour, phosphate dust being pumped unchecked from chimney stacks, old decrepit asbestos roof tiles and, even worse, a hurdy-gurdy response to the concerns of those citizens with the government rarely addressing the local issues. </PARA>

<PARA>Since coming to office in the early 1980s, this government has made considerable advances in transforming a protected and unresponsive economy into one that is now competitive, flexible and outward looking. Macro-economic policies have given us an economy that is very much a part of the Asian region. We have a GNP about the same as that of the six ASEAN nations combined, and we are one of the few industrialised economies to have a trade surplus with not just Japan but the whole of Asia. This is not due solely, as one might expect it to be, to our traditional exports of agricultural and mining products. In fact, we are now the 10th largest supplier of manufactured goods to Japan&mdash;ahead of Canada, Hong Kong and each of the ASEAN countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is able to compete on an international basis in the manufacturing sector. Exports as a proportion of GDP have grown by about 50 per cent in the past 10 years and stood at 20 per cent of GDP in 1992-93. Australia has also seen exciting growth in the area of elaborately transformed manufactures, with exports in this category almost trebling over the last seven years. Australia has been able to achieve this rapid growth in ETMs by specialising in not only expanding industries, such as pharmaceuticals, medical and scientific equipment and computer hardware, but also certain industries previously thought to be in decline, such as shipbuilding and motor vehicles. We also have an excellent industrial relations environment and the lowest total tax collections as a percentage of GDP of any OECD nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given this enviable macro-economic record, where are we to turn our attention to next? Clearly, the answer to that question has to be the area of micro-economic reform and competition policy. Competition policy is an essential element of our future national economic development. We cannot ignore the international nature of our economy, given the GATT round and the increasing international demands for fair and open competition and the removal of hidden subsidies and other barriers to trade. Future benefits in this area will rely on cooperative arrangements between the states and the Commonwealth. That has to be true, given our constitutional framework. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Council of Australian Governments agreed in 1992 to the establishment of an inquiry to lay the groundwork for a national competition strategy. In October of that year the Prime Minister established the Hilmer review, based on criteria agreed by the heads of government. The report of the review to COAG in August 1993 represents one of the most significant developments in this field since the enactment of the trade practices legislation in the 1970s. The trade practices area has come out well from that review and, indeed, the review has identified the benefits which have flowed from trade practices reform in the general business community. However, a lot of work now needs to be done in the area of government business enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commonwealth government business enterprises have been subject to Trade Practices Act review since 1977, but that is not the case with respect to state government instrumentalities and state government business enterprises. Indeed, one of the prominent ways in which enterprises can avoid the rigorous impact of trade protection policy and the implementation of free and open competition policy is through the exemptions provided by the state governments and the shield of the Crown which the state governments enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A truly effective and national competition policy requires that all service providers in both public and private ownership compete on the same terms. Competition and the distribution of infrastructure in the form of electricity, water, railways, aviation and increasingly telecommunications and other high technology services are vital if we are to reduce costs and improve service in the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already in the last few years we have seen benefits flow from deregulation of domestic aviation in 1990. This has resulted in declining air fares on nearly all routes, saving approximately $100 million a year for consumers of those services. We have also seen the introduction of competition into the telecommunications area, with STD peak rates on the Melbourne-Sydney route falling by 21 per cent between June 1992, when Optus first entered the market, and May 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Commonwealth and states have agreed in principle to the Hilmer reforms, the hard part of that process is yet to begin. The states will find themselves with an internal conflict of interest in that their immediate financial incentive will be to sell some of their business units for as high a price as they can get when Hilmer will reduce the effective value of some of these assets by exposing them to competition. It is essential that we overcome this internal reticence on the part of the states and ensure that those enterprises, where possible, be exposed to the full effects and benefits of competitive processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not necessarily follow from those Hilmer processes, though, that those enterprises need necessarily reduce in value. Some of the examples we have seen in the area of electricity are very instructive in this case. It is quite possible that, through reductions in cost structures and improvements in productivity which will flow from the benefits of that competitive policy, we will see the value of those enterprises enhanced and increasing revenue flowing to the states from them. Therefore, it should not be immediately supposed that an open competition regime, which Hilmer proposes, will necessarily adversely impact on state budgets. It is very much a question of how this is approached and how the states go about unbundling some of those enterprises to ensure that, where necessary, the network and generating facilities are retained in the hands of the state business enterprise while perhaps enabling some of the distribution mechanisms to be open to franchise agreements and further competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the telecommunications industry, which is very much a growing and evolving industry, I think we have already seen some of the ways in which this process can occur. Austel, for example, has been established to separate regulation from the delivery of service by Telecom. Telecom, of course, has previously had an important regulatory role which has now been overtaken by an independent regulator, Austel, and of course Telecom has now been left to deliver the service rather than regulate its provision. As Telecom is the provider of the national telecommunications infrastructure, it is essential that that infrastructure be made available to any other operator. Currently it is restricted to Optus but eventually, of course, it will be open on a much wider basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already seen substantial benefits flow from allowing other parties to access the nationally owned infrastructure but on terms which are regulated by the independent regulatory authority&mdash;Austel in this case. Other people are able to gain access to Telecom's networks at what amount to wholesale rates and then compete in the delivery of those services in a very effective manner. We certainly should not permit the duplication of very expensive infrastructure, such as the telecommunications network, when in fact we can gain the benefits of competition by simply determining access policies to those broader networks at reasonable prices and then ensuring appropriate franchise agreements to provide for the community service obligations which those existing government enterprises provide. Indeed, in the telecommunications industry we have seen the way in which Optus has been required to provide a levy to ensure that the community service obligations of Telecom are fairly funded across the board by all those who are part of the process. The importance of the social justice criteria which for many decades in this country have been underlying government enterprise in this area cannot be neglected in any element of competition policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also quite critical that we turn our attention to other areas of competition and, indeed, to some classic cases of market failure. In that regard I would look no further than the health industry and the legal industry. We have seen doctors and lawyers enjoy some very restrictive practices which have not been exposed to the benefits of competition and have resulted in what amounts to a classic failure of marketplace economics. Where anti-competitive arrangements exist within a profession and are not authorised in the public interest&mdash;which should be the sole criterion in this context&mdash;it is essential that that profession be required to be exposed to competition. It is very easy to suspect that, because certain professions are operating in the private sector, they are automatically competing on an open and fair basis, but that is not necessarily the case, as we have already seen with the legal profession and the restrictions which are imposed on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hilmer report is about a set of proposals for reforming and expanding competition policy in Australia. The next step in that process is very much a cooperative federalist one. It will be a great test of those relationships but one which I am sure, if Australian Commonwealth and state governments are able to meet the challenge, will ultimately benefit all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the motion moved by the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans). The  opposition endorses the  need  for  a coordinated national agenda on micro-economic reform, for which this motion seeks support. The coalition has welcomed Hilmer's report, although it has expressed some strong reservations. The general benefits of Hilmer's suggested reforms can be significant, especially when coupled with those recommendations to reform the professions in the private sector, as the member's motion highlights. However, I would like to express a number of major reservations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is a major push on regulatory reform and full-scale nationwide competition, it must not come at the expense of the delivery of vital services and facilities, particularly to rural areas, such as the one which I represent. The Hilmer recommendations have not been embraced by rural areas as enthusiastically as they have today by the honourable member for Bonython. The general reaction to Hilmer in rural regions is the recognition that something has to be shut or closed&mdash;be it a post office, a bank or the abolition of a statutory marketing authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last decade rural areas have been asked to bear the brunt of considerable reform. Trade barriers have been lowered and almost abolished in some areas, exposing fragile industries to the international market. The user-pays ideology dominates. Whilst the many government reforms in air and transport&mdash;which the honourable member brought to our attention&mdash;and in telecommunications have had immediate advantages for predominantly urban dwellers, rural people are still waiting for the benefits. They have suffered a substantial erosion of services, particularly in the areas of post, telecommunications and banking. There have been wide scale social implications with enforced economic rationalisation in government service providers. The Hilmer review can be criticised on the ground that it fails to take these social implications fully into account. This worries me. Leaving the market as the mechanism to resolve community concerns will place my rural constituents further out on a limb in the absence of critical population mass. Reliance on outcome certainties in rural areas would be better than market-driven approaches. The honourable member mentioned the community service obligations of government business enterprises. Under Hilmer, there is no doubt that these will be exposed to diminution. Unless the community service obligations of government statutory utilities are reinforced prior to any implementation of Hilmer's recommendations, rural people will suffer. Government needs to decide whether it wants people to live in rural Australia or whether it is intent on making it too expensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians living and working in rural and isolated areas are entitled to be provided with telephone and postal services of the same quality and standard, embracing new technological advances, as those available to people living in urban areas. Were telephone services to be deregulated as envisaged by Hilmer, no single carrier could be identified as responsible for universal service obligations. An example of what can happen is what is already happening in the delivery of mobile telephone services, particularly in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Mallee electorate covers roughly a quarter of the state of Victoria, yet only 15 per cent of that area is currently serviced by mobile telephones. If we are going to encourage new enterprises to go out there, we need to provide them with the technological advances which will allow them to compete in an international environment. When I complain about this situation, a typical response contained in one of the many letters I receive from Telecom is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We currently offer coverage to 84% of the population of Australia, but with an area coverage of only 4.5% of the land area. To cover the balance of the population with a terrestrially-based radio network is quite impractical.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a classic example of what can happen in the case of a completely deregulated, market-driven approach. I have similar concerns about Australia Post. Erosion of delivery is already occurring. There are locations in my electorate where delivery of mail has been reduced from three days per week to one day per week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might interest you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to note that the entire municipality of the shire of Wimmera&mdash;a significant shire in my electorate&mdash;now no longer has a single post office as a result of the rationalisation that has occurred to Australia Post. This is despite recent assurances by the minister in this House that post offices would not be closed, and despite assurances that there would be no adverse impacts as a result of the government's decision to lower the competitive price threshold from $4.50 to $1.80. Again I would say that the government needs to decide whether it wants people to live in rural areas and whether it wants to provide those areas with modern services. The minister should give consideration to advancing the rural mail services review which is due to report in 1996. I would like to see the results of that review at least a year earlier so that the real impacts on rural areas can be realised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also have major concerns in relation to what Professor Hilmer says about statutory marketing authorities. Professor Hilmer states quite categorically that statutory marketing arrangements are grossly inefficient and, effectively, tax users and consumers. This statement I would wholeheartedly contest because it fails to recognise that the major marketing authorities operating in extremely aggressive international export markets do so at great benefit to all Australians by enhancing export income. They are not price fixing mechanisms, they are price negotiating mechanisms, which is responsible, orderly marketing. If what Professor Hilmer says is fully implemented, Australians generally stand to be substantially disadvantaged. One of the major criticisms of Hilmer's report is that it has a very strong domestic focus; it fails to recognise the international focus of many of our commodities as they are delivered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would hope that the opportunity to provide an emphasis to request other people to lift their game does not cause the government to take attention off its own need to reform its micro-economic responsibilities. Focusing on the professions and on the activities of efficient marketing authorities is not the real issue that needs to be looked at in a total micro-economic reform agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our rural export industries hold the key to restoring our international competitiveness, restoring our international creditworthiness, reversing our debt problems and restoring living standards. Rural export industries badly need policy which will maintain a competitive exchange rate and reduce interest rates. What we are seeing currently is frightening small business right across the nation. These industries need policy which reduces the burden of taxation. All of these things add costs and charges to business and industry and reduce their ability to compete, particularly in an international environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, cuts in undue government spending to fund the huge bureaucracies of government need to be given serious attention. In addition to Hilmer's recommendations, there must be maximum flexibility in industrial relations, responsible wage negotiations and cuts in the costs of government. If all these can be included in a national agenda then we truly will have genuine macro-economic reform. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to join with the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) and the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) in making a contribution to this debate about micro-economic reform and competition policy. All too often when we talk about competition policy and micro-economic reform both sides of the House try to outdo the other as to who is the most virtuous or who is the most advanced. I want to pick up a few of the contributions that have already been made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true to say that we have benefited in the areas where we have deregulated monopolies and provided competition. The greater area of concern is whether or not we have given sufficient recognition to the fact that all consumers may not have equal access or equal power. As the member for Mallee pointed out, some consumers do not have a choice about products at all. I would like to advance the proposition that in pushing very hard for competition policy we need to strengthen consumers' rights. It is very difficult to ask farmers or small bush enterprises to be competitive with their sister organisations in regional cities or capital cities if they do not have the same access to infrastructure. I think that is the point the honourable member for Mallee is concerned about, and I strongly support that view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even in my own electorate, when it comes to communication, whilst there has been so much development of communication and prices and charges have generally lowered, it still remains the case that the poor do not have access to communications. Given that the communications media are going to be the vehicles by which in the future we will deliver the benefits of the super highway by saying to whole sections of Australians, whether they be rural and provincial Australians or whether they be urban, poor Australians, `You're going to miss out,' that will in fact double, treble or whatever the disadvantages that they may currently suffer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Together with competition policy, its espousal and its implementation, I also suggest that we should focus on the needs of consumers and consumer rights. For example, we are very keen to see the distribution of electricity and its retail system throughout the state governments, as well as that of the water boards, subject to further competition, and I support that idea. But I would like to remind the House that most of the money provided for emergency funding by the federal government to the states goes to people who have had their electricity or water cut off. That does not mean that competition is bad; that is far from the point that I want to make. But I do think that instrumentalities need to be far more innovative in dealing with the so-called battling consumer. All too readily a slow payer is labelled the same as a defaulting payer, and there is a world of difference. As yet we do not encourage monthly billing. I would like to see it encouraged. There is no doubt in my mind that more frequent, smaller bills would make budgeting for poorer, battling customers so much easier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk about doctors because so much has been said about health, the success or otherwise of Medicare and the changes that need to be made. I am very concerned that we do not seem to be picking up one group in the community that is suffering grievously because of the health charges of some specialists. Firstly, the specialists regulate their own numbers by limiting the supply of specialists coming on every year. Secondly, they ask people like pensioners, who are covered by Medicare, to fork out sums of money of the order of $6,000 to undergo operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps this reflects a weakness in the current system that needs to be addressed. It is really outrageous that those in the community least able to afford it are being asked to pay massive amounts of money to go private. No member on either side of the House, I believe, can be satisfied with this arrangement. Perhaps competition is something that may have an impact as far as specialist fees on the poor are concerned. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;May I begin by saying that as much as I enjoyed the speech of the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans), I am disappointed that the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) was not here to move the motion standing in his name. As the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) has said, the opposition supports the thrust of the Hilmer report. We believe that competition is a good thing. We believe in eliminating the rorts, the rackets and the rip-offs from our economy and not necessarily by throwing a textbook at every problem. There are certain occasions when it is possible to be too respectful of economists living in their ivory towers and not being up to the tricks that governments play.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite interesting that the member for Werriwa had published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> last week an article which demonstrates that the government's approach to Hilmer could very well produce more government rather than more competition. In particular, in talking about our health system he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most importantly, the income of all service providers would consist of payments by regional authorities.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, what the member for Werriwa wants and what he believes the Hilmer report should lead to is not more competition between health providers but the effective employment of all health providers not by their clients but by some huge bureaucracies. This is not a recipe for more competition, lower prices and more efficiency in our health system but a recipe for the nationalisation of our health system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Werriwa is not talking about more competition; he is talking, in effect, about moving towards the British system of health care. That may or may not have some virtues but it is certainly not a system which is characterised by competition. The member for Werriwa endorses the idea that the federal government should:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . pay public hospitals directly using the Casemix funding system thereby cutting out the complication of grants to the states.</PARA>
<PARA>Do we not have it in a nutshell? For this federal government, reform means eliminating the states, and cooperation with the states means effectively bypassing them. This is not a recipe for a more efficient system in this country; this is a recipe for concentration of power in the hands of the federal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not everyone in the federal government is so foolish as to believe that putting everything in the hands of government is the answer to all our problems. Indeed, no less a person than the former minister for health, ex-Senator Graham Richardson, understood that one of the important reforms we need is to get more people back into private health insurance. He even said that he believed the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) himself, as a very high income earner, should go back into private health insurance. It is greatly to the Prime Minister's discredit that on his sort of income he could not see his way clear to be in private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems with the government's approach is that it has tended to make reform in this country a dirty word.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this government, reform has not meant the better use of the resources of society; reform has meant that so many Australians have been thrown onto the scrap heap. Reform has become a dirty word in our society because, as soon as the government talks about reform, the people understand that this means paying one person a lot more money so that 10 or 20 or 100 people can be thrown onto the scrap heap of unemployment.

We are hearing all about the increase in interest rates and what is going to happen because the government could not run its budget properly, but let us look at what the government's mismanagement is really going to do. I draw members' attention to an address by the new President of the NFF, Mr Don McGauchie, in which he pointed out that a one per cent increase in interest rates will cost the farm sector about $170 million. He also went on to say that a one per cent rise in the exchange rate will similarly cost farmers around $160 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the government's mismanagement, financial institutions are being pressured into putting up interest rates, which in itself will have a very big cost factor for farmers. There is also likely to be a double whammy effect because interest rates will increase the value of the Australian dollar against our major trading partners, in particular the United States dollar, which many agricultural deals are written in. The farming community&mdash;one of our major export industries&mdash;will be hit twice by this government's mismanagement. It will have a very severe impact. </PARA>

Doohan won the 21-lap race in just over 41 minutes, 35 seconds ahead of the 1993 world champion, American Kevin Schwantz, who finished in fifth place. The 29-year-old Queenslander now faces the challenge of becoming the first Australian to win five successive races in the 500cc motorcycle world championships when the series continues in Italy next Sunday. There are still seven races to go in the series. If Doohan's success continues, 1994 might produce an Australian world champion. Let us hope so.

In many cases they have mortgages of $90,000 to $100,000. If, as predicted by the Labor government, there are going to be interest rate rises in the near future&mdash;as is quite clear from what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said today, prior to going off for his jet set tour of Indonesia to kowtow to the Indonesian leader, when he gave the clearest indication for a long time that interest rate rises are imminent&mdash;a one per cent rise will mean that some people in my electorate will be faced with an extra $60 a month.</PARA></TALK.START>

How can families that have already been hard hit by the recession, who are strapped by an income tax system that is totally biased against families raising children, possibly cope with the effects of interest rate rises of this enormity?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FT4">Mr BRADFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not mostly private. It is both public and private debt. That represents a $171.9 billion net debt. The situation is actually worse than that. We also need to look at foreign ownership of Australian equity; that is, stocks and shares in Australian corporations. That amounts to a further $145.4 billion. Australian investment abroad is $73.2 billion, so net foreign equity in Australian companies and businesses amounts to $72.1 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a pity it is in many respects that Australian companies and individuals have to look elsewhere to invest. The Australian Labor Party and the policies it has brought in have clearly failed to encourage Australians to invest in their own country. The answer by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) to a question in question time a couple of weeks ago was very hollow. He suggested that there was something wrong with those foreign investors who chose to invest in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that much of Australia is being sold cheaply. Many people from overseas are seeing the bargains that are here, but that does not alter the fact that many Australians are clearly choosing to invest outside Australia. Whilst we on this side of the House do not want to necessarily discourage that, I make the observation that that is costing hundreds of thousands of Australians jobs. If the economic settings were right in this country, Australians would be choosing to invest in Australia. They would be encouraged to invest in Australia and by doing so they would be creating jobs for Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the latest current account figures showed a fall of $1.84 billion in net debt, the latest figures also show a huge $5.04 billion inflow of foreign equity investment. Those figures are the second highest on record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Foreign interests owned 21.2 per cent of total Australian business capital as at 30 June 1992. Many people regard that as being a very conservative estimate. I have seen others estimate the figure to be in excess of 30 per cent. That figure of 21.2 per cent as at 30 June 1992 is an increase from 16.6 per cent as at 30 June 1980. So there is clear evidence there&mdash;there was particular evidence in the last set of figures&mdash;that there is an increasing interest in overseas investors buying shares and taking up equity in Australian corporations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be possible to argue&mdash;I think the Treasurer attempted to do this in his answer to the question&mdash;the relative merits of debt versus equity. It may be possible to make a case that the movement from debt into equity is in some way beneficial. However, the bottom line when we add these two together&mdash;in an accounting sense that is the correct thing to do because what I am pointing to is Australia's total foreign indebtedness&mdash;is that Australia's total foreign liabilities now stand at $244 billion net. That is up from only $38 billion just under 10 years ago, at the end of the financial year 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The gross figure&mdash;if we talk in gross terms the figures are even more horrific&mdash;is $346.5 billion. That compares with a gross total foreign indebtedness of $55.1 billion at the end of 1981-82. I will make that point again. That is an increase from $55 billion just over 10 years ago to almost $350 billion today. If we break that amount down to an amount per capita, the debt is $20,000 for every person in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It ought to concern every Australian that this government is continuing to sell off the farm at an alarming rate. We sometimes hear hollow and simple defences for that action, but when we look at the balance sheet of Australia in accounting terms, we see that it is crook. It is not a healthy balance sheet at all. Of course, balance sheets do not measure the potential that this country has to be great&mdash;I have no doubt that it does have the potential to be great&mdash;but in simple accounting terms the debt this country now has to others is enormous. It ought to concern every Australian and I believe that in the lead-up to the next election it will become a major issue as people finally realise the extent to which this country has been sold out by the government in the last 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has consistently produced a current account deficit. Each month we drop further and further behind. If it is only a billion dollars or a billion and a half dollars it is considered to be a good result. Each month we have that result we must rely further on foreign savings to keep us afloat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other part of this equation is Australians' savings. Our savings rates are deplorably low. If we look at a table of national savings over a period, we see consistent falls since the mid-1970s peak of 26.8 per cent of GDP to only 15.8 per cent of GDP in 1992-93. By world standards this is an extremely low figure and it adds up to the fact that people in this country have been highly taxed and they have had their investment income taxed so they have been reluctant to invest, and they have been given expectations about having a funded retirement, which has been counterproductive in terms of savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not arguing here&mdash;certainly the opposition would not be arguing for this&mdash;for financial regulation, although we must observe that in many respects deregulation has not worked effectively. Clearly, though, financial deregulation has allowed significant supplementation of domestic capital from overseas. Given the continuing fall in the domestic savings rate, either use of foreign capital had to expand or the Australian investment rate had to fall. Quite clearly we cannot have high consumption and high investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Foreign equity investment may be qualitatively better than debt, but it will still ultimately lead to the repatriation of profits overseas. I have seen arguments lately that suggest that the cost to Australia in economic terms will be greater in the long term from the repatriation of profits than it would be from having to meet a commitment as a result of debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has not set a very good example for the private sector. To take up the point of my good friend over here, we do have a significant public debt in this country so it is not correct to take the simplistic cop-out and say that it is all private debt. Even if it were all private debt it would still be a problem for this country, but the fact is that we now have a very significant public debt. Public debt is a collective liability of all present and, of more concern to me in a lot of respects, all future taxpayers as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Net government demand for capital exceeding net private sector supply of capital has led to the importing of foreign capital by both the public and private sectors. That brings us back to the situation today, where so much pressure is being put on interest rates. When the government has to go out and finance a deficit of $11 billion&mdash;or perhaps closer to $18 billion, which it effectively is&mdash;then of course there is going to be pressure on interest rates. We are seeing plenty of evidence of that at the moment. The fact is that Australia is actually hooked on debt. There is little light at the end of the tunnel. The gap that has been made up by the steady rise in foreign ownership shares and other productive assets is not in Australia's best long-term interests. The government's failure to address the underlying causes of our alliance on foreign funds which, however it is rationalised, threaten our economic sovereignty is deplorable. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

It is also true to say that, given the ethnic composition of Australia, their numbers are not fully reflected in the parliament of Australia. However, over recent months in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland there has emerged the disturbing tendency of people to work for their own political agendas in an attempt to manipulate some sections of the ethnic community. I believe this is called branch stacking.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Macedonian community in the Illawarra is, in my view, being manipulated by some individuals&mdash;not all from within the Macedonian community&mdash;who are running a political agenda which, to their mind, would reach its climax with the replacement of me as the member for Throsby. Honourable members would be aware that, over recent years, three members of this chamber have consistently espoused the Macedonian cause, be it on the question of recognition, the term `former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia', the highly offensive term Slav Macedonia, the access of Australian Macedonians to consular facilities, the question of human rights, the way Macedonian minorities are reported to have been treated in other countries, or the amount of broadcast time on SBS for Macedonian programs in the Macedonian language. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The three members have been the former member for Stirling, Mr Ron Edwards, my colleague the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) and me. Each of us over many years has espoused the Macedonian cause, at some cost to ourselves. It is not always a popular cause to espouse, as the telephone calls I get in the middle of the night remind me. I make the point that I embraced the Macedonian cause not for political expediency but because I did believe and still believe in the justice of that cause. This has been especially true on the recognition issue. I believe that Macedonia met all the requirements for recognition. I also believe&mdash;as I have said in this chamber many times&mdash;that, given the large Macedonian population in Australia, Australia should have been among the first to recognise this country instead of being among the last. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also fair to say that I have until recently enjoyed a close working relationship with the Macedonian community, not only in the Illawarra but Australia wide.

In that article he made very telling points about the disruption and divisiveness of branch stacking. Most ALP branches in New South Wales have between 25 and 50 members. This is certainly the case with most of the ALP branches in my electorate, but I believe that even Senator Loosley would be somewhat amazed to see what has happened in the Warrawong branch in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Warrawong branch of the ALP has enjoyed quite a chequered history. Membership has widely fluctuated. During the past 12 months there have been great difficulties with gaining quorums for meetings, and monthly meetings of the branch have been abandoned for this very reason. In the past, there was talk of branch closure. We even changed the night the branch met to a Friday night, and we changed the venue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were 11 stalwarts in that branch&mdash;two of them with a Maltese background, one was Macedonian, and the rest were Lebanese, five from one family. It is true to say that the Warrawong branch was the smallest and poorest ALP branch in my electorate. It was the one ALP branch which contributed nothing to the last federal election campaign. In fact, the president of the Warrawong branch approached me earlier this year to pay a levy charged by head office because the branch could not afford it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In two months this financially embarrassed, struggling multi-ethnic branch has gone from having a membership of 11 to having a membership in excess of 500. In one night, 318 people&mdash;all of Macedonian background&mdash;felt the urge to join the Australian Labor Party and did so at the Warrawong branch. The next month, over 150 joined. One suspects that the Warrawong branch has also gone from being one of the poorest branches to one of the richest, because the head office of the New South Wales ALP gave to the Warrawong branch a receipt for in excess of $4,000 for membership fees paid in cash. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The local petrol station, which is Macedonian owned, was the recruitment centre. People collected their forms there, filled them in and deposited them at the kebab shop next door&mdash;also Macedonian owned. Some of them did not quite understand what they were filling in. They were told to fill in the forms and, as they cost no money, they took them down to the community centre. In fact, some of them often rang my office and asked me about the form. The queue for the meeting&mdash;the attendance went from 11 to in excess of 318, complete with television cameras et al&mdash;stretched from the first floor right out into the street. People would progress up the stairs, and they were directed by two young spivs from Sydney who instructed them where to sign in the book. They then turned around and left the meeting. In the meantime, the other meeting was proceeding with the 11 loyal and devoted members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Bolkus visited the area to fulfil a longstanding appointment, he and I were met with a barrage of bottles and eggs. When we finally reached the building where the meeting was to take place, the front door was kicked in and, for good measure, the back door was smashed in. It appears that my sin is that, when I went out to see what was happening&mdash;it was fairly obvious&mdash;and was interviewed by the television stations, I said that it was a disgraceful exhibition that did the Macedonian people, their cause or the Illawarra no credit. I retract not one iota from that statement. It was not I who put the news bulletin of the disruption out that night; it was the local television stations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After that the Macedonians, with the help of a couple of spivs from the New South Wales Labor centre unity faction&mdash;and, I believe, with the support of the New South Wales ALP head office&mdash;decided to stack against me. In this, they were ably assisted by the secretary of the South Coast Labour Council and the president of the Throsby FEC who, the day after the 318 people went in, had a meeting in Wollongong with the Macedonians. It is somewhat ironic that the two local Macedonians most involved in the stacking are both funded by federal government grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ilce Musarevski, who is employed by FIMEE as a migrant liaison officer, is responsible for dealing with all migrants in the area, not just the Macedonian people, but has set himself up as a Macedonian recruitment officer to such an extent that he has actually produced a pamphlet which has been sent out&mdash;hopefully not with FIMEE postage. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the one way for us Macedonians to have control in the Branches of the Australian Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On Tuesday 154 members were accepted by the NSW Administrative Committee and now we have total control of the ALP for Throsby, which means exactly we have sang Colin Hollis' song, and the entire number of members has to go for the seat of Throsby. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From Macedonian background 542, which is 2 times more than the total (others) and that is why we have total control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A letter was sent around by these spivs, signed on ALP paper, telling people what to do. One of them, David Tanevski, signed himself `regional organiser'. That is a criminal offence because there is no such position in the Illawarra ALP. I was recently invited to speak at a rally down here, but the same people from Wollongong prevented me doing that. I welcome new members of all ethnic backgrounds, as I believe all political parties do, but I do not believe that such blatant stacking does anyone anyone any credit at all. The issue of Macedonia is complex. It will not be sorted out in Australia; it will be sorted out but by Greece and Macedonia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry that we cannot extend the time of the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), as it was such an interesting speech on branch stacking in the ALP. I am sure that we could all learn from it. Today I would like, firstly&mdash;and solely, if I use up all my time&mdash;to address a problem that has arisen in my electorate in relation to the children's services program. This is a program of the Department of Human Services and Health, administered by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will refer to the aims and objectives of the children's services program, as listed in a handout by the minister. The first priority is children whose parents are in the work force. The second priority&mdash;the second of four&mdash;is children or parents with a continuing disability or incapacity. It is against the law of this country for children with disabilities to be excluded from the child-care program. The out of school hours care program is a combination of the after school program and the vocation program. The laws of the Commonwealth of Australia state that discrimination is against the law. The second priority of the children's services program is that children with disabilities be included in this program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the instructions relating to the program, at paragraph 6.4 `Enrolment of children', there are priority of access guidelines; that is, firstly, work force participation or training and, secondly, children with disabilities. The handbook for these organisations further mentions that the priorities to be considered within these groups are parents or children with disabilities. Taking this into consideration, I think we would all assume that a child with disabilities would have access to the out of school care or vocation care in South Australia. But that is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can go even further because we realise that children with disabilities may require extra care. There has been a lot of rhetoric from the department on supplementary services grants. These grants are to assist with out of school child care. The department provides examples where extra money&mdash;supplementary service grants&mdash;can be given. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A broad range of services may be suitable for SUPS funding. The following examples give an indication of the types of services which may be funded under SUPS.</PARA>
<PARA>Example No. 11 is children with disabilities. Grants will be provided for workers to assist children with disabilities; the training of staff and caregivers in the special requirements of certain disabilities; provision of specialised toys for use of children with disabilities; and minor capital grants for modifications to premises. Three elements would make us believe that children with disabilities would have access to these programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">South Australian children with disabilities do not have access to this program at all. The Ascot Park Primary School, a local school which runs an after school care program for children with disabilities, raised the problem of an autistic child whose mother works and who requires assistance to stay in the program. A staff of only two have to care for the normal range of children plus the autistic child, as he has special needs. They simply cannot do this without extra funding. No special funding has been available, despite every possible avenue that this school has gone through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In following up this matter, I thought there must be some mistake. It is written in black and white in these different forms, including the supplementary service grants, that this is a particular area of need to which money should be given. So I rang the office of the Minister for Family Services and asked whether supplementary service grants could be used on this occasion. The minister's office knew nothing about the supplementary service grants. I was given the phone number of the South Australian Department of Health and Community Services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I rang the number, it turned out that the number had been disengaged several months ago and was no longer the department's phone number. This did not make things any easier. I went back to the minister's office and asked whether there were any other numbers I could ring. I was given another number of a person in the department. I rang the person concerned and asked about the grants. That person had not heard about the grants, but referred me to somebody else who had. I was assured that those grants would definitely be available for somebody with disabilities in after school child care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rang the next person, who put me on to Kay Filmore, from the special needs office. When I rang her she said that she had been trying for well over a year to get assistance under this program and that basically no assistance was forthcoming whatsoever. It seems that the department does not know what is happening; nobody seems to know what is happening. This seems to be another example of this government's rhetoric. It says that services are available to the community when they are not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government stresses how much it looks after people with disadvantages and how it is targeting the disadvantaged in the community. When we look, we find that there is no action on the ground. The department does not even seem to know about it. The department would have received information from Kay Filmore because, as I said, she has been trying for a considerable time to get this service for the people she works for. She states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without funding for supplementary services for out of school hours care families with children with disabilities are effectively denied access to these programs.</PARA>
<PARA>I wonder how seriously the government takes its own programs when there are 10,000 places for out of school care in South Australia and not one of those places is for children with disabilities. I ask the minister to address this as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter that is of concern to me arose out of my previous position as shadow minister for the environment. I have mentioned this issue to the present shadow minister, the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan). I hope that he will take it up. The issue of considerable concern to me is the importation of exotic birds into Australia. I can see no good reason to import exotic birds into Australia when the importation of those birds puts our own bird population at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, two macaws were imported into Australia. They were in quarantine in England, where one of the birds died. The other bird continued on its way into Australia, where it was diagnosed in quarantine in Australia as being ill. After being examined, no cause of illness could be found. It was then given injections of hormones and antibiotics and released into Australia. Subsequently, it died of a disease known as macaws wasting disease. Macaws are parrots. Parrots have a general genetic composition in common in the Southern Hemisphere and can pass diseases from one parrot species to another. So had that parrot had some contact with our native parrot population, it could have passed on this macaws wasting disease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter is not only of concern to me but also to vets of considerable standing in the community. I mention in passing Dr Patricia Macwhirter and Ross Alan Perry, who is a veterinarian who deals with budgerigars. Mr Perry has stated that in a recent shipment 19 budgerigars were examined and found to have megabacteria. He asks: if these budgerigars are released from quarantine into Australia with megabacteria, what are the guarantees that no other diseases are being released into Australia from imported birds?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While my specific interest is in the environment, I followed this matter up. I found that the reason for the importation of these birds was simply so that those people who already had exotic birds in Australia could increase their genetic pools. As laudable an aim as this may be, I do not think in any circumstances it justifies Australians bringing parrots or other birds into Australia with a quarantine period which is obviously not long enough to look at this disease. The quarantine stations focus on diseases in poultry and not diseases in Australia's wildlife, specifically Australia's parrots. I grieve today that such a thing should be allowed to occur. I ask the minister to look at this matter in the interests of the future of Australia's wild bird population. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do so much work. There is one particular event that I draw to the attention of the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs, who is at the table. The RTA Big New South Wales Bike Ride is coming to my electorate of Gilmore. It will be the first time it has come to a federal electorate. It is the first time a federal member has sought it and, with the local councils, put together and won a bid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That may seem well and good and not very newsworthy, but I contend that an event which costs between $600,000 and $700,000 to stage will result in a significant economic influx to my electorate of Gilmore. My region will receive an immediate economic stimulus because of the money that will be spent there. There is more. The electorate will receive exposure in a tourism sense. People who live quite close to us are going to see some of the treasures of my electorate that they did not know about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leonie Watman, the events organiser for Bicycle New South Wales, and Simon Roundtree, the events coordinator for the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Australia, toured the route with me and spoke to the mayors, councils, chambers of commerce, leading citizens and various groups such as the police, firemen and other emergency service groups. We did this so that we could start the planning and highlight the economic benefits that will flow from the event which will come through my area in the first week of March next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the first stage in a long process. I will have my electorate wound up and looking forward to benefits that can be obtained from the Olympic Games in the year 2000. It is our estimate that the first travellers will come to our shores in 1996. There will be a trailing off in travellers after the year 2000 and we will probably still see the effect of the Olympic Games to the year 2001 or 2002. I sincerely hope that the tourist operators and those involved in business within my electorate will be finely tuned by that stage. I hope we will have gone through the RTA Big New South Wales Bike Ride with such a degree of cooperation and enthusiasm that we will be able to package and market our area for the bigger prize&mdash;the dollars that will come to Australia as a result of the Olympic Games. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of this was ever mentioned in the recent publicity. The media did not want to know about this. When I first started to put the idea forward, there was some degree of ridicule. Some in the media were saying, `What is this federal member doing pushing for something like this for his area?' I will continue to push for this event. I will continue to push for things like the aero modelling world championships to come to my electorate. That is a $3 1/2 million event. These events may not be the Olympic Games or at the cutting edge of huge international events, but they are very significant for electorates like mine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I refer to the work I have done in changing the opinion of the council on where sewage should go. When I became the member for Gilmore on 13 March 1993, the Shoalhaven City Council had a policy that it was going to put all its sewage effluent out to sea. It had a bogus community discussion program which basically said, `We'd like to put it somewhere else but we're going to have to put it out to sea because it is much cheaper than any of the other options.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has taken over 12 months, some very hard ball and some very hard discussions to come to the point where the Shoalhaven City Council has abandoned its plans to put effluent into the ocean. I know what the minister at the table, who is a keen fisherman and who has congratulated me on the two four-kilogram snappers and the two 2 1/2-kilogram snappers that I have managed to catch in the last four weeks, thinks about the prospect of people eating fish that were caught in areas polluted by sewage. </PARA>

The bottom line is that, through a novel and lateral thinking approach, we have managed to look at employment potential that effluent management can achieve for my people. That means the re-use of effluent on farm properties and farm forests. These are not innovations that I have made. They are not new in the Australian context, but they are new to some people within my electorate. The attitude that anything which is not the way it has been done for the last 50 years in Sydney is not on is finally dying. We actually have people within my electorate who can see the use in protecting new industries, such as the mariculture, which I am sure the minister is deeply concerned about.

The fact that this term of council has had the first woman mayor and the second woman mayor, ever, in 127 years of local government, I would suggest is relevant to women getting the vote. The fact that Kiama now has a woman mayor, I would have thought, would have made it even more relevant.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring two matters to the attention of the House. The first concerns the decline in the standards of Australia Post's mail delivery service from capital cities to country areas and the second the practice of operating double standards in the delivery of Telecom Australia services. Is this House aware that Australia Post's nationally agreed and accepted standard for letter deliveries from city to country areas is now three days? The service to country areas was considerably faster than that 34 years ago, as one of my constituents in Donnybrook, a town in the south west of Western Australia, will confirm. He informs me that the mail was delivered from Perth by steam train and arrived promptly at his office each morning at 8.30 a.m. His office was in the habit of opening the mail, dealing immediately with the urgent matters by the time of the next postal collection at 1.00 p.m. and could confidently expect the mail to be delivered in Perth promptly the next morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With all the modern technology available in this day and age, Australia Post now accepts that a satisfactory service between Perth and Donnybrook is a three-day delivery time. In fact, there are a number of instances where it has taken longer. On one occasion a letter posted on Tuesday did not reach South Perth post office until the following Monday morning. Mail sent from Bunbury to Albany in the south of my electorate has to first travel 200 kilometres north to Perth before being sent southward again past Bunbury to Albany. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Constituents in the south coast town of Denmark, in my electorate, tell me that it is not unheard of for mail clearly addressed to `Denmark, WA' to be delivered weeks later, having been sent first to Denmark in Europe. One has to wonder, with clearly addressed envelopes and properly used post codes, just why this sort of mistake and this poor standard of service should be tolerated from a modern mail delivery service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter I wish to raise concerns the standards of service available to country Telecom users. Last year, Telecom Australia announced in a blaze of publicity that it was spending $3.3 billion on new telecommunications infrastructure. A program of network modernisation and expansion would `springboard Australia into the 21st century', according to a senior Telecom officer. Western Australia was promised a $313 million boost as a result of the new future mode of operations, FMO, program, which was hailed as a revolution in our telecommunications system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new high-tech system would give users of services: itemised call records; call wait, which notifies a user that a second caller is on the line; call divert facilities; call control, which allows a personal identification number to be used; and a delayed hotline, a facility frequently used by the frail and the aged in an emergency, which automatically dials up a program number when the receiver is picked up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This major cash injection also promised to provide malice call tracing facilities, abbreviated dialling, third party conferencing and various other facilities that have become commonplace in Australia's  capital cities. But while Telecom may appear to have its sights firmly set on the future, a large constituent of its rural customers are firmly of the opinion that Telecom's headlong plunge into high technology has left them completely out in the cold. For thousands of rural customers in my electorate, Telecom's technological advances are not contributing in any way at all to an improved standard of service for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is still a very large number of customers in the south west and the great southern regions of Western Australia who are denied access to the sorts of Telecom services that metropolitan subscribers have taken for granted for many years. They are denied access to itemised billing, to Easycall and to other network based facilities. Quite simply, the perception in country areas is that they are treated by Telecom as minority, second-class customers who have to accept a second-rate service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is even worse, many of those country customers face a further delay of four or five years before they can enjoy the benefits of the changeover from analog to digital telephone exchanges. To the north of my electorate is the rural town of Brunswick Junction. Telecom services to Brunswick Junction are poor. Subscribers are forced to tolerate frequent faults, do not have access to itemised billing and, to make matters worse, they have been disappointed on a number of occasions when Telecom has made assurances that the local exchange would be updated only to later abandon those assurances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand from Telecom that the upgrade of Brunswick Junction telephone exchange from analog to digital is now not scheduled to take place until the 1998-99 financial year, with the possibility of call charge information by June 1996. They may just scrape in on the tail end of Telecom's five-year future mode of operations program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the rapid advances being made in telecommunications technology, it is incomprehensible that Telecom can operate a two-class system, one high cost and high-tech for city customers, with the other barely an advance on the clumsy, makeshift system our grandparents used. Country people have had to tolerate a declining service coupled with increasing costs. Country public telephone boxes have been removed, public phone box call charges have been increased, and on 1 June I understand that Telecom also wants to slap a four per cent increase on local call charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As if this is not enough, country users now have to pay for out-of-area telephone directories to be delivered. Previously they were provided free by Telecom. When I raised this matter with Telecom I was told:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The number of outlets for out-of-area directories under the previous system made it extremely difficult to estimate customer demand with any degree of accuracy. With over 1,300 post offices and some 2,600 postal agencies nationally, the opportunity for waste in both transport and raw materials is greatly increased if demand is overestimated.</PARA>
<PARA>Surely Telecom can estimate waste just as easily by developing a more accurate estimating process. I am quite sure, for example, that country users would not object to placing their orders on a toll-free number if they could continue to receive free directories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point raised by country constituents is Telecom's assumption that a Perth telephone directory is an out-of-area directory for country users. Many agricultural machinery manufacturers are based in Perth. If parts or supplies cannot be sourced locally, a Perth office can be found in the Perth telephone directory and goods freighted down overnight with a minimum of delay to the farm business. To many people in the rural community, access to the Perth market is an essential part of their business and is not an out-of-area service extra, as Telecom attempts to make it. Similarly, the rapidly expanding tourism market in the south west and great southern regions has to have access to the state's capital city, not just for its visitors&mdash;the bulk of whom come from Perth&mdash;but for a great deal of its essential supplies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telecom has consistently failed to understand that country people rely on an efficient, reliable telephone service far more than people in capital cities. To the rural community the telephone is a vital link, to the agricultural and tourism industries especially. It is the single most important piece of business equipment. It makes business possible, and country customers have every right to expect the same standard of service enjoyed by their city counterparts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the south west of my electorate, in Albany&mdash;which students of Australian history such as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) will know, was the first part of Western Australia to be settled&mdash;Telecom has still not provided a fully itemised billing facility for all the town's telephone customers. Changeover to a fully digital exchange, with all the services and facilities that will provide, is not scheduled until the 1998-99 financial year. At this point it might be useful to quote Telecom's group general manager of networking technology, Mr Doug Campbell, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For Australian business in particular, FMO will be the springboard into the 21st century. The world is knocking at our doorstep and FMO is our welcome mat.</PARA>
<PARA>What he did not say is that the world will have to wait up to five years to get a welcome mat from the south west and great southern regions. Speaking from a business background, I can assure Mr Campbell that business opportunities do not hang around for five years for people to act on them. Neither Telecom nor Australia Post has any right to expect country users to tolerate these double standards. For all the so-called advances being made, services are simply not being improved and the cost of those services is certainly not coming down for country users. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, by highlighting these severe communication problems, I have given the impression that they have not taken place in one of Australia's remote areas, let me correct that impression. The south west and great southern regions of Western Australia are amongst the fastest growing areas in the state.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I want to draw the attention of this House to the problem of so-called funny money on Green and Fitzroy Islands which continues to cause offence to many of my constituents in Far North Queensland. For generations, residents have made daytrips out to Green Island. Glass-bottom boats have been used to view the beauty of the reef from Green Island as far back as the 1930s. Green Island is a coral cay and it is the oldest nature reserve in the Great Barrier Reef region, having been declared a national park in 1937 and a marine park in 1974 under Queensland legislation. It has also been used a boat building yard and a fishing retreat from the earliest days of settlement in the Cairns area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fitzroy Island is a continental island off Yarrabah. It is a beautiful rainforest clad island that has also been a long-time popular destination for Cairns residents and tourists alike. Both islands have resort and visitor facilities that are leased to a foreign owned company, Daikyo, which operates the very successful Great Adventures tourism packages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since I have been the member for Leichhardt, I have heard rumblings in the community about the so-called funny money being obligatory on Green and Fitzroy Islands. The point at issue is aptly put in a letter from a constituent who wrote to me earlier this month. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am in possession of Australian currency, the notes of which all bear the phrase, `Legal tender throughout Australia and its Territories.' Why, then am I not permitted to use this currency on Green and Fitzroy Islands in exchange for goods? Why must I exchange my currency for another before I can purchase any goods? Have Green and Fitzroy Islands become separated from Australia?</PARA>
<PARA>My constituent goes on to ask why Australian currency is not valid on these islands. That is a very good question indeed. The questions put to me in this letter by my constituent are typical of questions asked by the thousands of Cairns residents who visit Green Island and find to their surprise that the Australian currency in their wallets will not buy them a seat on a glass-bottom boat. It will not even buy them a beer or a hamburger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been to Green Island and I have seen the currency exchange booths located right throughout the resort area. If people want to buy anything on the island, from a diving trip to a packet of chips, they have to use Daikyo's so-called adventure vouchers. The vouchers are not Japanese yen, although rumours to that effect have whipped around Cairns at various times. According to Daikyo's publicity blurb, the adventure vouchers:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . will be for exclusive use on all Great Adventures cruises and on Green and Fitzroy Island. You'll be able to buy anything you need from drinks and food to souvenirs to dive courses with the vouchers. So you won't need cash.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Adventure vouchers are equal in value to the Australian dollar. You'll be able to buy individual vouchers or books of vouchers.</PARA>
<PARA>People can get a refund on any vouchers they have not spent at the end of their tropical sojourn. Cairns residents are asking why Great Adventures has introduced this money exchange system. I am not into conspiracy theories. There is no question of Daikyo taking over Australia or subverting our sovereignty. In my opinion, the only logical reason for Daikyo introducing the voucher system is that it makes money for the company. Successful corporations are dollar driven, and Daikyo is a very successful corporation. So one can only assume that the voucher system works to improve the corporation's profit margins, and this can only be at the expense of the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, Daikyo hopes that its customers will leave with adventure vouchers still in their pockets or take the funny money home as a souvenir. One of the selling points of the voucher system is that the holders of the vouchers get a five per cent discount on all purchases. This strikes me as quite bizarre. If Daikyo has a monopoly control over pricing on the islands and people can buy goods or services only with adventure vouchers, the benefit of a five per cent discount seems rather illusory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, I have heard Cairns locals argue for the right to use Australian currency at the bar on Green Island, encouraged by other more gullible patrons to change their money so that they can get the fantastic five per cent discount. The locals in question decided to leave their drinks untouched on the bar rather than change their money. Such is the depth of local discontent with the voucher system that I will write to the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh) seeking advice on whether the adventure voucher system infringes any consumer protection laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me to the next big question constantly asked by Cairns residents: is the money exchange system legal? I have received a copy of a standard response to this question from the Reserve Bank. The response, which is truly worthy of Sir Humphrey, reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Governor has asked me to reply to your letter of 26 July concerning the use of purchase vouchers on a cruise to Green Island.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legal tender law relates only to the settlement of existing debts. Trades may specify the form in which they will accept settlement for their services or products before the `contract' is entered into. For example, here in Sydney there are signs on the approaches to the Harbour Bridge saying that 1c, 2c and 5c coins will not be accepted in payment of the toll. We do not know the background to why the operators of some island resorts do not wish to handle Australian currency notes. They are, however, entitled to use their own voucher system if they wish, provided, of course, that they do not contravene the Reserve Bank Act, the Crimes (Currency) Act or any other legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>The analogy with the Sydney Harbour Bridge toll misses the point completely. The toll is demanded in Australian currency. If Sydney drivers had to hand over bottle tops, monopoly money or adventure vouchers to a foreign owned corporation, the analogy would be meaningful. I am sure that regular bridge users in Sydney would be just as outraged as Cairns locals are about the Great Adventures voucher system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last paragraph of the letter from the Reserve Bank raises the question: just what contravenes the Reserve Bank Act, the Crimes (Currency) Act or any other legislation? Section 44(1) of the Reserve Bank Act under the heading, `Other persons not to issue notes', states that `a person shall not issue a bill or a note for the payment of money payable to bearer on demand and intended for circulation'. The Crimes (Currency) Act is concerned mainly with making counterfeit money and counterfeit securities. I might also add that section 23 of the Currency Act 1965 is relevant here, but I do not think that I have time to quote that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have written to the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) to get the definitive word on the legality of adventure vouchers, in view of the above acts and any other relevant acts. The people of Cairns are entitled to be fully informed of the legal basis for such a locally contentious matter as the money exchange operated by Great Adventures&mdash;if the exchange is legal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it clear that I am not suggesting that the money exchange system is illegal and I am not raising this matter in any way to discredit Daikyo. As I said earlier, Daikyo has been a huge contributor to the Cairns economy and is a big employer in the city. I have raised these matters because they understandably concern many of my constituents. I can assure members of this House that the subject has raged long and furious on Cairns talkback radio and in pubs and workplaces in the city. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cairns tour operators&mdash;I think the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) will back me up here&mdash;assured me that it is also a constant topic of conversation with visitors to the Great Barrier Reef. It is not stretching the point too much to say that, if not resolved, it has the potential to affect the image of Far North Queensland amongst potential domestic tourists. For these reasons, I believe that the matter should be clarified in the near future. Even if the practice of issuing these funny money notes is not illegal, I take the opportunity in this grievance debate to call on Daikyo to abandon its practice of using funny money consistent with its other actions as a good corporate citizen of Cairns and Far North Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of its inquiry on this matter my committee received submissions from the national secretary of the Communication Workers Union, from the Leader of the National Party, and from the honourable member for Adelaide. In addition, oral evidence was received from the honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman). We were grateful to those members who made submissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key facts in this matter were not in dispute: commencing on 8 December 1993 the delivery of mail to the electorate offices of a number of members ceased. Further, it is not disputed that this arose as a result of decisions taken by members of the Communication Workers Union. Each of the members who put views to the committee outlined the effect of the industrial action on the work of their electorate offices. An important point was made by the honourable member for Indi, who made it clear that his concerns were not so much about any effects of the bans on him in a personal sense but rather that ordinary citizens were deprived of the ability to communicate with their elected representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Paul Watson, National Secretary of the Communication Workers Union, advised the committee that the action taken by his union was not intended as, or taken in the knowledge of it being considered as, a breach of privilege. He said that the union `had expressed dismay' at the cabinet decision in relation to an Industry Commission inquiry into mail services. He said that the union initially contemplated widespread industrial action which would have caused great public disruption during the pre-Christmas period. The union had subsequently decided on a more limited form of action which would have an impact and demonstrate the level of concern amongst its membership. The union stated that it was believed that members were not fully aware of the consequences of the government decision, and it was felt that the union action would bring the concerns home in a meaningful way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has been satisfied that the ability of a number of members to perform what they accepted as their duties to constituents was impeded as a result of the actions complained of. As it happens, the committee is not aware of any particular case of what may be regarded as a substantial harm or damage was caused to a member of to any constituent, but it is clear that the bans had the potential to cause a serious problem. The committee recognises, as a predecessor committee did several years ago, that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The realities of political and public life are such that members from time to time are subjected to various forms of inconvenience or irritation as a consequence of being members of parliament.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our view, actions such as the bans in question go beyond what the House should be prepared to tolerate. These particular actions have caused inconvenience to members and to ordinary citizens and do not represent an acceptable means of expression of concern. In the present case the committee has found that although it would be open to it to make adverse findings in respect of those responsible, it has not done so, having regard to the apparent ignorance of the relevant law on the part of those responsible, to the apparent absence of any intention to offend, and to the fact that the disruption caused was of a limited duration. I commend the report to the House. It deals with a difficult but important issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;As a member of the Privileges Committee, I endorse the report which the chairman of the committee has just tabled. There are some elements of the question of parliamentary privilege and its particular application in the case covered by the report to which I would like to refer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principle contained within the institution of parliamentary privilege is an extremely important one. Contrary to those who believe it has reached its use-by date, it continues to fulfil an essential role within our system of parliamentary democracy and a fundamentally important role to make it possible for people in this chamber and in the other chamber to take up those issues which they, in conscience, believe it is their responsibility to take up and to be beholden to no-one, except perhaps to the parliament itself. However, the principle of parliamentary privilege will survive only while it is respected by parliamentarians and the parliament. It can survive only if it is not abused and if it is not used as a vehicle to provide protections for parliament and parliamentarians which are outside the narrow focus of its purposes and which are not available to other members of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The circumstances addressed by this report of the Privileges Committee concern bans which were imposed by the  Communication Workers Union on the delivery of mail to and dispatch of mail from the offices of members of parliament in December 1993. The issues involved in this matter go to the heart of parliamentary privilege and the question of how it should be interpreted and applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The casual interpretation of `privilege' by the House of Representatives, by successive officers of the House and in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> has allowed it to assume a wider meaning than it has within either the House of Commons or within our own legislation&mdash;the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> on page 685 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parliamentary privilege relates to the special rights and immunities which belong to the Parliament, its Members and others, which are considered essential for the operation of the Parliament. These rights and immunities allow the Parliament to meet and carry out its proper constitutional role, for Members to discharge their responsibilities to their constituents and for others properly involved in the Parliamentary process to carry out their duties and responsibilities without obstruction or fear of prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Privileges are not the prerogative of Members in their personal capacities.</PARA>
<PARA>There are three important points to note about that statement. Firstly, for `members', the reference is to their `responsibilities'. Secondly, for `others', the reference is to their `duties and responsibilities'. Thirdly, privileges are not the prerogative of members in their personal capacities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Another very significant element of the statement is that while the legislators in the Parliamentary Privileges Act use the term `members' duties' the authors of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> have chosen to use the less rigid and more embracing term `members' responsibilities'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House of Commons has always adopted a more restricted interpretation of privilege and contempt than that which the House of Representatives has chosen to adopt. In the House of Commons, care has always been taken to ensure that there is a connection between any action complained of and&mdash;I underline the next word&mdash;proceedings in the House or a committee. If there is no such connection, the matter is taken no further. Thus, in a case like the postal ban issue, it would never have been referred to the House of Commons committee of privileges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987, which is quite explicit in its reference to privilege, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conduct (including the use of words) does not constitute an offence against a House unless it amounts, or is intended or likely to amount, to an improper interference with the full exercise by a House or committee of its authority or functions, or with the full performance by a Member of the Member's duties as a Member.</PARA>
<PARA>Thus, we have enshrined in legislation a wider interpretation of privilege than that ever adopted in practice by the House of Commons. That is perfectly legitimate except that the interpretation of privilege now hangs on the meaning of `member's duties'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context it is important to note, firstly, that the legislation refers to the full performance by a member of the member's duties as a member. Thus, it does not have to be generalised conduct affecting all members; it can and does include conduct which affects the full performance of any single member's duties. Secondly, it also includes the reference to the `member's duties as a member'. Thirdly, it does not use the expression `responsibilities' but the much more restrictive expression `duties'. How then can we interpret `member's duties'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Duties' may be either moral duties or legal duties. I believe that we must dispense with moral duties from inclusion in the protection of privilege, because all members would see their moral duties as members differently. The Parliamentary Privileges Act states that for conduct against a member to constitute an offence it must interfere with the full performance of a member's duties. I underline and emphasise the phrase `a member's duties'. May states that the `House will proceed against those who obstruct members in the discharge of their responsibilities to the House'. I underline and emphasise the word `will'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taking those two references together, the inclusion of `moral duties' in the interpretation of `duties' would mean that the House would be required to act whenever the moral duties of any single member were obstructed. Some actions which some members may see as their `moral duties' as a member of parliament have included, or could include, illegally trespassing on Commonwealth property to protest against nuclear arms issues; illegally committing acts to prevent damage to the environment or to prevent certain developments; and attending religious services, political meetings and social activities of various kinds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Would or should we consider any `conduct' which is `likely to amount' to an improper interference with the `full performance by a member' of his or her moral duties as a breach of privilege in connection with which the `House will proceed against those who obstruct members'? Clearly not; the proposition is absurd. Thus, the interpretation of `member's duties' is clearly intended to relate, and can only be interpreted as relating, to a member's legal duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are at least two legal duties of a member which immediately come to mind: to attend sittings of the House; and to provide a statement of registrable interests to the registrar. There are probably others. In connection with the postal ban imposed on members of parliament by the Communications Workers Union, it must be realised that it is not a legal duty for members to receive mail; it is not a legal duty for members to read or otherwise process mail; and it is not a legal duty for members to reply to correspondence. Clearly, all sensible and conscientious members will do these things and many others in fulfilling their responsibilities or functions, but they are not legal duties of members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Successive Speakers of the House of Representatives have placed their own interpretations on what constitutes or contributes towards a breach of privilege. In 1978, the Speaker concluded that a strike which affected the whole of Canberra and was not directed solely at the parliament did not constitute a prima facie case of breach of privilege. In 1985, the Acting Speaker concluded that union bans affecting all mail and which did not subject members to particular action in their capacity as members did not constitute a prima facie case of breach of privilege. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 15 December 1993, the present Speaker said that, on information available to him, the postal ban was directed specifically at members and would have been affecting their capacity to perform their duties as members. The Speaker concluded that a prima facie case did exist. As I have said, the fact that the bans were directed specifically at members should have been, on the basis of both practice and law, of no consequence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have disputed whether interference with members' mail would affect their capacity to perform their legal duties. Members of the House of Representatives have sought to widen the protection available to them under `privilege'. They can only do this by expanding the interpretation of `duties' or extending it in less subtle ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) raised the issue of the postal ban in the House of Representatives on 13 December 1993. He suggested that it seemed to him to be a clear breach of privilege, presumably supported by the fact that the ban was directed specifically against members of parliament. However, action under neither the provisions of privilege nor contempt requires or is assisted by any singling out of members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The letter of the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) dated 25 January 1994 to the chairman of the Committee of Privileges gave reasons why the postal ban may have involved breaches of the Australian Postal Corporation Act and the Commonwealth Crimes Act. However, apart from quite legitimate concerns about `democratic process', `improper' action, `inappropriate' industrial action, unanswered mail and Christmas deadlines, there is not substantial support for the claim that her legal duties as a member of parliament were improperly interfered with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) wrote to the Committee of Privileges and detailed the actions of his office in relation to the ban. He said that a large amount of mail was delayed in the critical pre-Christmas period. He said that the ban was a `restriction on electors' access to members of parliament and, as such, restricted members of parliament from carrying out their duties on behalf of electors'. Although the honourable member used the word `duties', he also gave it a wide meaning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) gave oral evidence to the committee. He indicated that he was more concerned about the effect of the ban on his constituents than any inconvenience it may have caused him. He said that it involved `grossly improper pressure' on MPs to influence policy. He said that he thought `a parliament should, through the process of its privileges committee, stand up for people'. He expressed concerns about the rights of private citizens, especially in the context of communicating with their elected representatives. He said that he considered it his duty `as an elected member of parliament to respond to mail'. While the concerns of the honourable member would probably be shared by all MPs, it is doubtful whether they are best addressed via the principle of parliamentary privilege. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There appears little doubt that a more conscious effort needs to be taken to ensure that the protection afforded members of parliament by parliamentary privilege is not expanded consciously, unconsciously or by default to the point where it is considered to be breached simply because a member's capacity to fulfil an accepted function is deliberately interfered with. It is quite clear that the term `a member's duties as a member' needs to be clarified and defined. We should not allow its meaning to be progressively extended in an ad hoc and piecemeal way simply to satisfy the wishes of members to expand the shield of parliamentary privilege for their own comfort, security and protection. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The report which I have just tabled refers to the proposed construction of an Australian Embassy complex in Hanoi, Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The proposal includes a new chancery, a head of mission residence, staff apartments and recreational facilities. The estimated cost of the project is $23.605 million at March 1994 prices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current Australian Embassy in Hanoi consists of a two-storey French style villa used as a chancery, adjoining villas on either side and a purpose built block of staff apartments. There is also a swimming pool and a recreation area. One of the two adjoining villas is the ambassador's residence and the other contains staff apartments. The chancery was first occupied in 1978 and the two adjoining buildings were occupied in 1991 after extensive renovations. Although the chancery building has been extensively renovated by Australian tradespeople and completely rewired, maintenance of the building remains a constant problem. The chancery is unfortunately already too small for current requirements and will be converted into a senior staff apartment as part of this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Overseas Property Group has accorded the Hanoi project a high priority among proposed capital works projects because of the inadequacy of both the office and residential accommodation. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade endorses the construction of the new custom built chancery and the official residence as it believes it will make an invaluable contribution to promote Australia's identity in Vietnam and will demonstrate Australia's firm commitment to developing a substantial long-term relationship with Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lifting of the United States economic and trade embargos against Vietnam has opened the way for resumption of lending to that country by the international financial institutions and major bilateral donors such as Japan. These developments will stimulate economic growth in Vietnam, and this will bring increasing commercial opportunities for Australian companies. This will place increasing demands on the Australian Embassy in Hanoi which is already operating at what can only be described as beyond full stretch in servicing the current level of relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to a new chancery and official residence, it is proposed to construct a four-storey apartment block. The existing staff accommodation is below standard and there is a lack of appropriate alternative accommodation available on the open market. Where residential accommodation is obtainable, extensive refurbishment is required. However, refurbishment costs are high and even the best accommodation may still be substandard after refurbishment has been completed. The construction of well-built accommodation within the chancery compound will enhance the physical security of staff while also providing for emergency power and filtered water supplies. There will also be significant savings in the long term to the Commonwealth resulting from rental savings and lower maintenance costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hanoi has few recreational facilities available for staff. There are no clubs and there are very few sporting facilities of a suitable standard for casual hire. The present chancery compound has a small recreational area with a swimming pool. The recreational facilities in the new complex will include a tennis court, swimming pool and squash court. The committee is satisfied that these facilities are fully justified in Hanoi which the committee was advised is an extremely difficult living and working environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The site for the complex is located in an area of Hanoi which is being developed as a diplomatic enclave and already accommodates a number of diplomatic missions and their associated residential apartments. The committee was initially somewhat surprised to discover that the site is currently part of a small freshwater lake as indeed are all non-developed sites in this area. The site, which will be reclaimed, has an area of 1.17 hectares and will be leased from the Vietnamese government for a period of 60 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee sought an assurance from the Overseas Property Group that the construction of the embassy complex on reclaimed land would not present difficulties. The Overseas Property Group advised the committee that it believed that the site would be suitable although further geotechnical advice will be sought and there could be a cost loading for the extensive piling system required. The Overseas Property Group advised the committee that the presence of unexploded ordnance on the site was not expected. However, the committee has recommended that a metal detector survey of the site should be undertaken before construction commences as a precaution against the possible presence of unexploded ordnance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the committee welcomes the construction of this project, it is fair to say that the committee is somewhat disappointed with the design of the complex. The committee was advised by the Overseas Property Group that, in large measure, the design was influenced by the characteristics of the local building industry in Hanoi which has a combination of comparatively cheap and unskilled labour with a high work ethic&mdash;it sounds like my own area! The industry is labour intensive, with minimal mechanical equipment being available. Therefore, all proposed embassy buildings will be simple in form and structure to make allowances for the local building industry both in relation to short-term construction requirements and longer term maintenance factors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One difficulty that we as a committee face when we come to pontificate on such buildings is that it is almost a fait accompli before we receive the plan. We receive the proposed building plan and we do not have a chance, at this stage, to have an input into the design of the building. To achieve the necessary building quality it will be essential that expatriate trade and specialist services supervision form part of the construction program. All imported materials will come through the port of Haiphong which could become an area of delay to the project as trade activity increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the committee understands and accepts the practical constraints which led to the design solution for the Hanoi complex, it does not believe that the design reflects the positive and dynamic image which Australia should be projecting in Asia. The committee is of the view that the Overseas Property Group should hold a design competition when a project of this nature is being developed in future. The committee believes that the Overseas Property Group does not have an underlying design philosophy which would enable its architectural consultants to express a sense of an Australian identity in building projects. The committee has recommended that the Overseas Property Group should develop such an underlying design philosophy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There must be many architects who would be only too willing to submit a design for a proposed Australian Embassy with the prestige associated with such a work in many parts of the world. I personally wonder what the architect is trying to achieve with this fairly pedestrian complex. I know that design is often an individual issue. Our embassies around the world and our chanceries are a mishmash of designs. Few reflect an Australian image. I think a couple of the better ones are the Beijing complex and the building under construction in Suva. These buildings are fine but many of the others leave a lot to be desired. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This building that we are now recommending to this parliament is like something out of the 1950s. We were told by the architect and by the Overseas Property Group that we were not to be too ostentatious, overelaborate or overprestigious. We most certainly have achieved that. It is a breezeblock building like something out of the 1950s. It is a very plain building but, I guess, it is a functional building. It will add absolutely nothing to the architectural merit of Hanoi and Australia's image. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is very important for us, especially in countries like Vietnam where more and more Australian companies are going and tendering for buildings. We were told that the friendship bridge was an example of what Australian concrete companies could achieve. I dread to think what image we will present to people who see the new embassy complex in Hanoi. We are not asking for an overelaborate building, but we are asking for something a little more updated than the 1950s and something that would portray the sort of image of Australia that I thought we as a parliament were trying to project in Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following recent construction experience in Beijing, Jakarta and Phnom Penh, and in order to achieve the desired project quality, it is envisaged that a considerable number of Australian trade and specialist supervisory personnel will be employed during the construction phase. The successful contractor will be required to specify and use Australian products wherever possible. Australian manufactured furniture will be used throughout all buildings. Overseas Property Group expects that the material components will be 80 per cent Australian content. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated earlier, the total cost of the project is $23.605 million. However, it is interesting to note that there will be no impact on the budget as funds will be made available from the sale of properties in Singapore. Overseas Property Group advised the committee that the sale of the properties in Singapore will also finance the construction of a chancery in Islamabad, the refurbishment of Australia House in London, the purchase of land for housing in Shanghai and also the construction of a modern residence for the Australian High Commissioner in Singapore. I am only hopeful that Overseas Property Group gets as much money for the sale as it thinks it is going to get. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of the difficulties likely to be experienced in the construction of the project, the committee sought an assurance from Overseas Property Group that the cost of the project would not rise significantly, as was the case in Beijing. Overseas Property Group stated that, unlike the Beijing project, an Australian project manager would be appointed with Overseas Property Group taking control of the project from the initial stages. In Beijing, Overseas Property Group was tied to a Chinese construction company and also did not have direct control of the project. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>It is not my intention to further canvass the issues raised in opposition to the Student Assistance Amendment Bill 1994. Let me make it quite clear that the government insists on disagreeing with the requested amendments presented to this House for the second time by a message from the Senate. If agreed to, these requests for amendments would have the effect of virtually removing the assets test from Austudy, cause a financial burden upon the people of the nation and enshrine in legislation inequities which the government will not accept. I ask the House to again reject the requested amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to the requests for amendments from the Senate to the Student Assistance Amendment Bill, the coalition is opposed to the course which has been elaborated by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) briefly this afternoon because we believe they, in effect, will seek to hold the government to a commitment it made to the Australian people, and to students across this country, in the budget of last year and in documentation which arose from that budget. In a sense, when one looks at this matter one can quite clearly see that there was a commitment made by the government at that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will briefly touch on the background to this matter. This matter arose from last year's budget and from statements which were made in a series of documents pursuant to that budget that, in effect, if a person held a health care card then, so far as the assets test under Austudy was concerned, that assets test would be waived. This statement, or this commitment, on behalf of the government was made on at least four occasions. The first occasion was in a departmental budget kit for student assistance after last year's budget. This kit clearly set it out in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 1994, special assessment will be extended to students whose parents hold a current health care card. Such students will qualify for Austudy without parental income and assets test.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, if you are the holder of a health care card which does not carry with it an assets test you would be able to obtain Austudy without that assets test as well. That statement in the kit was followed by a media release from the Department of Employment, Education and Training on 13 September last year, which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Effective January 1, 1994 students from families holding a Health Care Card will qualify for maximum AUSTUDY entitlements, with means and assets tests waived. This measure is especially beneficial to low income families which are not on Department of Social Security or Veterans' Affairs benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, a statement from the Department of Employment, Education and Training has set out the same information&mdash;namely, that the holder of a health care card will qualify for Austudy and that the assets test would otherwise be waived. So on two occasions, in two documents officially from the department, this commitment has been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following those documents there was the release of the 1994 Austudy guide. The 1994 Austudy guide is a glossy publication which is published jointly by the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the National Union of Students. In numerous places in this glossy publication, this official guide to students&mdash;and their parents around Australia&mdash;seeking to apply for Austudy, information is set out to the effect that, once again, holders of health care cards will have the assets test waived. One of the paragraphs in the Austudy guide states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 1994 the assets of both you and your spouse generally will not be counted if your spouse holds a Health Care Card.</PARA>
<PARA>So on the third piece of documentation from the department we have a clear indication of the government's commitment. Finally, if when going through the Austudy application form people tick `yes' when it comes to indicating whether they hold a health care card, they miss having to provide any information required in relation to assets. On the face of the application form for Austudy, holders of health care cards do not have to provide information relating to their assets. That supports the documentation previously released by the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was the situation up until early February of this year. On 7 February some of the student assistant offices around the country, and parents and students who had applied to Austudy pursuant to this provision, found out that, where the assets test had not previously been complied with, that would no longer be the case. The first public indication of this was a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 15 February of this year. I mention it because it quite clearly shows the minister making a response to this matter that differs from his response this afternoon and on previous occasions. The report, headed `Austudy rethink may hit farmers', states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A spokesman for Mr Free said yesterday an "administrative contradiction" between the Department of Social Security and DEET had occurred and that some people applying for Austudy benefits might have been affected.</PARA>
<PARA>That indicates that there is some administrative contradiction between the Department of Social Security and DEET. The report goes on to quote the spokesman for the minister. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"The Government intends to honour its policy but at this stage it is not clear whether it can&mdash;this will take a few days to sort out," the spokesman said.</PARA>
<PARA>In the first public response to this matter we have a spokesman for the minister saying that `the government intends to honour its policy'. What is the policy or the commitment that has been set out in no less than four documents emanating from the Department of Employment, Education and Training? On the face of those documents, it is that, for the purposes of Austudy applications, the assets test is waived for holders of a health care card. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister indicated this afternoon, that situation has now been reversed. We have had indications on various occasions that the cost of this would be something from $25 million down to $10 million. We are not sure what the cost is. We have had indications from Senator Schacht in the Senate that only 100 students might be affected yet, as the National Farmers Federation pointed out in September of last year, the statistics do not give an accurate indication of the numbers of rural people who would like to undertake further education but who are unable to because of the government's policy on asset testing. We do not actually know how many are concerned, yet the minister said again today that this is somehow going to blow a hole in the budget so far as DEET is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If $10 million were involved, one could probably find considerable savings from within DEET itself that would cover that amount of money. If we look at the DEET budget for this year and in previous years we see that this is a department which continues to expand. This is the department of government which, when questioned in Senate estimates earlier this year, could not actually indicate where one of its divisions had gone&mdash;it had been lost. We have continual expansion in the numbers of public servants employed by that department each year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the midst of the rural crises that we have around this country&mdash;floods, fires and droughts over much of the country over the past few years&mdash;this measure, which was seen by farmers and others in rural areas as beneficial, is being ripped away from them by the government. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was recently off on his latest tango in Paris, yet here is the minister saying, `There is about $10 million here which we cannot make up in some way in the department.' I suggest to the minister that $10 million worth of waste in the Department of Employment, Education and Training would not be too difficult to find. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of this is that, first of all, the matter was treated secretly. It was almost a month before the minister came into this chamber and made some statement about the matter, even though the student assistant offices around the country had been indicating to students that they would no longer be able to qualify for Austudy without the assets test, even if they held the health care card. It was a month before we had any clear indication that this was what had happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we had the excuse from the government that it was some `administrative contradiction', to quote the spokesperson for the minister at that particular time, and that therefore it was something that should simply be overlooked, even though it was quite clear that at least some families around Australia would be adversely affected. The department will admit to a minimum of 100 families being affected, although there are quite clear indications that many more families are affected by this measure. Therefore, it is something that is of real concern to many farming families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My office has had reports and telephone calls from families in various parts of Australia saying that this has made a clear difference to their ability to provide education for sons and daughters, particularly those wanting to obtain higher education at both higher secondary and tertiary levels. The effect of this measure is that those students who have obtained Austudy with the health care card&mdash;that is, without qualifying under the assets test&mdash;will lose that qualification after their health care card runs out. Normally, health care cards run out after a period of six months unless they are renewed. There is a situation of real injustice for those families. We have hundreds of other families across Australia who relied upon what they saw as a commitment from the government to recognise their particular difficulties being ripped away from them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, as I indicated to the minister at the outset of my contribution to this debate, we on this side of the House will not accede to his motion. We believe that this is a microcosm of Labor's approach to public policy generally because it illustrates one of two things. It demonstrates either inept administration, if we believe what the minister says about this&mdash;even though what he says seems quite contrary to the first response from the department&mdash;or, more likely, a reversal of a commitment that was clearly given to the Australian people. When one looks beyond the rhetoric to the government's lack of commitment to rural and regional Australia, one can see that this has been illustrated once again in this particular motion before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the situation last year where the same government was moving to take 16- and 17-year-olds off Austudy and put them onto family payments. The effect of that would have been a saving to Treasury overall, a reduction in the amount of Austudy that many of those kids would have received, a reduction in the weekly amounts, a reduction in the income test and a reduction in the assets test as well. I think this is just another example of the way in which rural and regional students are being treated by this particular government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not matter what the government says about its policy; it does not matter what platitudes are spouted around the country: what one has to look at is the actual policy and the actual practice to determine what its policy is. Here are two illustrations of what its actual policy is. No matter what platitudes are spouted in this place or in the bush about how it cares and is concerned for students in rural Australia, the sad fact is that for those who come from a rural part of Australia, their educational opportunities are much less than they would be in metropolitan urban areas. That is a fact documented by a series of studies, not least of which was the  1991 report of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are looking at policy, not the policy that is spoken about in platitudes in this place but the policy which is actually practised by the Labor Party in relation to rural students around this country, we see in these two illustrations and in this motion before the House tonight an attitude towards rural and regional students that says that in some ways they are not to be treated equally with students from other parts of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a government which has in other areas implemented affirmative action programs in order to raise some people and some sectors of the community so they can be treated as equal, yet here we have clearly documented evidence about the inequality in terms of educational opportunities and educational outcomes for students in the bush in Australia. The bush people regarded this measure to be to their benefit, particularly in times as harsh as at present, yet the government after six months ripped away what was regarded as a commitment to these people. The message to people in the bush from this government in relation to this particular motion is, `Forget educational opportunity. We simply are not interested in it.' If the government offers platitudes in the future and says, `We are interested and we are out to give you a fair go,' people in the bush should look back on the record, look back on this motion tonight, look back on the passage of this legislation and look back on what the government tried to do in relation to 16- and 17-year olds with Austudy. That record speaks loudly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to some of the remarks made by the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), this issue has been discussed a number of times in this chamber. I simply reiterate that the policy was quite clear in terms of the cabinet decision on this matter. The cabinet decision embraced the income test but not the assets test for health care cardholders. The honourable member for Menzies is wrong and he knows he is wrong when he perpetuates that fiction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, this is far from a matter of discriminating  against families or young people living in regional or rural Australia. In fact, to do what the opposition is asking would be to make a special case of that group by making the assets test inapplicable for that group only in Austudy applications. Finally, if this is such a good idea, as opposition members are now saying, I wonder why it was not included in their policy last year. If one reads Fightback, one will find no mention at all of the removal of the assets test for Austudy purposes for farming families. Indeed, if one reads Fightback one will find only a proposal to remove some 30,000 students from Austudy to save an estimated $30 million. I find it interesting that these matters are still being attended to by the former shadow minister. Apparently his successor, who certainly has had time to get across this issue, does not approach it with the same enthusiasm as the honourable member for Menzies. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members will recall that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 was substantially amended during 1993 to give effect to the recommendations arising from the review of the act by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the more significant changes was the establishment of the Torres Strait Regional Authority&mdash;the TSRA&mdash;which is to exercise ATSIC powers and functions with respect to Torres Strait Islanders and Aboriginal persons in the Torres Strait area. The TSRA will commence operation on 1 July this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will extend the powers of the TSRA to:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">enable the Prime Minister to confer a departmental function on the TSRA;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to enable the minister to confer commission functions on the TSRA;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to give the TSRA the power to negotiate, cooperate and enter into agreements with other Commonwealth bodies and with state, territory and local government bodies and to make grants and loans to the state of Queensland and its authorities, including local government authorities; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to allow the TSRA to use moneys in the TSRA land and resources fund for the development and implementation of the marine strategy referred to in the Torres Strait <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> development plan, or in developing or maintaining real estate, or in acquiring an interest in land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will allow the minister, by notice in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>, to increase the number of members on the TSRA from the current ceiling of 20 to a maximum of 23. The bill also allows the minister, at his or her discretion, to make rules for the conduct of elections in the Torres Strait area or in any part of the Torres Strait area by a system of wards, including the power to prescribe the maximum number of members per ward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two other amendments relate to the zone election rules and clarify when elections for regional councils, commissioners, the TSRA and any other election are completed for the purposes of filing election petitions. I turn now to the major provisions of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendments relating to the Torres Strait Regional Authority</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 7 enables the Prime Minister to confer departmental functions on the TSRA and the minister to confer a function of the commission on the TSRA. These amendments are necessary as the TSRA will, from 1 July this year, exercise ATSIC powers and functions in the Torres Strait and as ATSIC will no longer operate in the Torres Strait area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clauses 8 and 9 give the TSRA the power to negotiate and cooperate with other Commonwealth, state, territory and local government bodies and to enter into agreements and make grants and loans to the state of Queensland or an authority of that state, including local government bodies. These powers are essential for the TSRA to be able to operate independently from ATSIC in the Torres Strait area, particularly as the island councils, which will be major beneficiaries of TSRA funding, are local authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently the Torres Strait Regional Council, in accordance with a notice issued pursuant to section 116 of the act, consists of 20 members, constituted as follows: 18 members elected under the Queensland Community Services (Torres Strait) Act 1984-1990 to represent particular communities in the Torres Strait area; and two members elected under the ATSIC Act to represent particular communities in the Torres Strait area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 1 July 1994 the Torres Strait Regional Authority will be constituted in exactly the same way as the Torres Strait Regional Council. Those persons elected in March this year will automatically become members of the Torres Strait Regional Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November last year, I commissioned a review of the constitution and electoral process of the Torres Strait Regional Council. The review was conducted by Professor Jeremy Beckett, Professor of Anthropology at the University of Sydney, as chairperson, and Pastor Allan Mosby of Thursday Island, who is a member of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review committee expressed concern at the lack of representation given to Thursday Island in proportion to its population. Its report states that, according to the 1991 census, Thursday Island has approximately 35 per cent of the Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal population in the Torres Strait area but is currently represented by only two of 20 regional councillors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 12 allows the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, by notice in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>, to increase the number of members on the TSRA from the current ceiling of 20 to a maximum of 23 members. Such a notice would be subject to parliamentary disallowance. If the minister decides to change the number of members of the TSRA, clause 12A allows the minister to amend a notice under 142S to provide for any additional members and the method and timing of their election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have reconvened the review committee to conduct further consultations with the Torres Strait Regional Council, the island coordinating council and Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal organisations on Thursday Island as to the extent of any increase in the number of members on the TSRA and whether the increased number will represent Thursday Island as a whole or particular communities or wards on Thursday Island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subject to the advice of the review committee and the passage of these amendments by the parliament, I propose that a supplementary election be conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission as soon as possible after the enabling legislation is assented to. Clause 13 enables the minister to make rules for the conduct of TSRA elections by a system of wards. It should be noted that the provisions allow for maximum flexibility so that rules can be made for the conduct of elections in the Torres Strait area or in any part of the Torres Strait area by a system of wards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be noted that TSRA election rules, including rules for the conduct of elections by a system of wards, can only be made by the minister after consulting the TSRA and the Australian Electoral Commission. Clauses 14 to 23 are consequential to the amendment providing for wards in the Torres Strait area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 25 broadens the scope of the TSRA land and resources fund. The provision in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Act (No. 3) 1993 establishing the TSRA land and resources fund&mdash;through section 144W&mdash;stipulates that moneys in the fund may only be spent in making grants for the acquisition of land and in acquiring land. However, because the Torres Strait is essentially a marine environment, the purposes for which moneys in the fund may be spent should be broadened to include development and ongoing maintenance of real property, including improvements to such property and the development of marine resources in accordance with the marine strategy to be contained in the Torres Strait development plan. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendments Relating to Zone Election Rules</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 4 varies the current provisions of the act which require that zone elections, including supplementary elections, must be conducted under the rules in force at the end of the election period for the preceding round of regional council elections. The bill provides that a supplementary zone election must be conducted in accordance with the rules in force immediately before the day on which the minister fixes the last day for the close of the poll for the supplementary election. A supplementary election is defined as a zone election held to fill a casual vacancy in the office of commissioner representing the zone or a zone election held in place of a zone election in relation to which the Federal Court of Australia has made an order under schedule 4. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, it is proper that any supplementary election be held under the rules in force at the time the minister calls such an election. The rules in force for a normal round of zone elections following a round of regional council elections will continue to be those rules in force at the end of the election period for the preceding round of regional council elections. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">End of Election Period for Zone and Other Election Purposes</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 30 amends schedule 4 of the act to provide when petitions may be lodged with the Federal Court of Australia in respect of a round of regional council elections, a round of zone elections, a Torres Strait Regional Authority election for all the wards and for any other election. Currently, section 140 provides that schedule 4 applies where there is a dispute in relation to a regional council election or a zone election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Item 3(e) of schedule 4 provides that subject to clause 5, which deals with petitions by the AEC, every election petition shall be filed in a registry of the court within 40 days after the end of the election period. The ATSIC act does not stipulate what the end of the election period is in relation to a zone election. The Attorney-General's Department has advised that the act should be amended to indicate clearly the meaning of paragraph  3(e) of schedule 4 in relation to elections subject to challenge by virtue of section 140 of the ATSIC Act. Clause 30 of the bill expressly provides that any petition disputing an election, whether a general election or a supplementary election, must be filed in a registry of the Federal Court within 40 days after the last day on which a poll is declared. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill contains non-controversial but essential provisions for the efficient and effective operations of the Torres Strait Regional Authority, provides for supplementary zone elections under rules which are current at the time of the election and clarifies the commencement dates for petition periods for all elections conducted under the act. I commend the bill to the House and I hope it will be passed with the same degree of cross-party support as has accompanied amendments to the ATSIC Act while I have been the minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1994 extends the authority of the Torres Strait Regional Authority which comes into operation this Friday, 1 July 1994. The Torres Strait Regional Authority was established under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1993 with the support of the coalition. The official launching of the authority will be held on Thursday Island on Friday. It will be with great pleasure that I attend this historic event. In the words of the chairman of the Torres Strait Regional Council, who will now be the chairman of the authority, the authority will empower Torres Strait Islander people to take control of their destiny and to determine the future of their children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments in this bill will allow the Prime Minister to confer a departmental function on the Torres Strait Regional Authority and the minister to confer a departmental function of ATSIC on the authority. These amendments were necessary so that from 1 July this year the authority will be able to exercise full ATSIC functions in the Torres Strait. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Torres Strait Islanders comprise one of Australia's most isolated peoples, separated by sea from one another and separated by vast distances from the rest of Australia. They have few of the services and amenities taken for granted by most other Australians and normal opportunities for advancement are limited. Only recently a fundamental weakness of Labor's approach to Torres Strait Islanders has been its failure to recognise the unique civilisation of islanders and their need, living in a distant region of Australia, to manage their own affairs. The 1993 bill gave the Torres Strait Regional Authority authority to take over ATSIC functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate that indigenous organisations shape government policy, manage government programs and make funding decisions with regard to the communities they represent. The islanders have their own traditions and languages, they have their own legends of origin and they have a distinct cultural history. For thousands of years they were and they still are a seafaring people and the relationship between the islanders and the sea is a key one. Not only has it been the basis of their livelihood, but also it has influenced their cultural traditions, social structures and general wellbeing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate that this legislation allows the authority to use money in the Torres Strait Regional Authority land and resource fund for the development and implementation of a marine strategy that enhances the relationship between the islanders and the sea. Section 144W(3) of the bill recognises that the Torres Strait is a marine environment and allows funds to be used for improvements to property and development of marine resources in accordance with the marine strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the debate on the earlier bill, which set up the authority, the coalition applauded the move to local self-management. The coalition is pleased that the authority will now have the power to negotiate and make agreements with other Commonwealth bodies, and state and territory government bodies. We note those aspects of the bill that provide the authority with the power to conduct elections, make loans, develop its own marine strategy for the Torres Strait area and develop and maintain real estate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year, in a paper presented to the International Indigenous Politics and Self-Government Conference in Norway, the chairman of the Torres Strait Regional Council, Mr Getano Lui Jr, asserted that there must be a health and medical preventative and clinical service accountable to the people of the Torres Strait with provision for culturally sensitive services. He called for appropriate social services, cultural programs, education administration and public services. He said&mdash;and the coalition echoes these sentiments&mdash;that facilities generally available to all Australians and Queenslanders must be available in the Torres Strait. The government stands condemned that islanders as with other Aboriginal communities have suffered from a lack of basic services that other Australians take for granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently the federal Race Discrimination Commissioner found that the basic human rights to clean water and good sanitation that most Australians take for granted were not enjoyed by people in remote communities. This reflects on the government which is so good on rhetoric but, when it comes down to services, does not live up to that rhetoric, and the people who suffer are those and other disadvantaged communities in Australia. It is these sorts of issues that the new authority will be addressing. The coalition is pleased that the best interests of the people of the Torres Strait will be decided by the people themselves. These amendments and the original bill affirm that the islanders are citizens of Australia and Queensland but rightly become responsible for their own destiny. The coalition supports the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to take part in this debate and express my support for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1994. As has been outlined by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) and the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), the main purpose of this bill is to establish the Torres Strait Regional Authority. As the honourable member for Hindmarsh said, that will  allow  the  people  of  the  Torres  Strait to determine their own future and their own affairs.  I  applaud  that  and  I believe  the House should support this bill. I know that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, have visited the Torres  Strait  and  know  of  not  only  the physical beauty of the islands but also the beauty of the people. The Torres Strait is a unique region and I think some of the issues that will face the Torres Strait Regional Authority are unique to that region and therefore will probably require some unique solutions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately the people of the Torres Strait, like other indigenous peoples of Australia, are suffering under appalling conditions, as reflected in their health statistics. They have also suffered problems with regard to their access to services that the rest of the Australian community take for granted. It goes without saying that if colonisation of Australia had not occurred the appalling health statistics we now have in the Torres Strait would not be occurring. That comes through very clearly when we talk to people from Thursday Island, Badu Island, Murray Island or any of the other islands in the Torres Strait. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had the pleasure of talking to a number of leading community people in those islands on a number of occasions. I was speaking to a representative of the Torres Strait community last week in my work on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs in our inquiry into the implementation report on Aboriginal deaths in custody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Steve Mam, who is an important spokesperson for the Torres Strait community, said, `We did not have deaths in custody in the Torres Strait before colonisation occurred and European settlement came to Australia because we did not have people in custody. We did not have people who were homeless. We did not have people who were dependent on alcohol or on drugs or on tobacco, which cause some alarming health statistics. We had a sense of community and we dealt with our people with that sense of community.' It has been because of the way European civilisation has so dramatically affected the people of the Torres Strait and set about a progressive destruction of their culture that all of those problems have now emerged. It is our responsibility to restore to the people of the Torres Strait some independence so that they can once more come to their own solutions to these problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that it is only when the people themselves are in charge of their own future that the correct and appropriate solutions to all of these problems will emerge. That is why I fully support this legislation. By setting up the Torres Strait Regional Authority we are giving the people of the Torres Strait power over their own destiny, a much greater level of power than they have experienced to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important thing that we need to understand about the islanders of the Torres Strait is that they have maintained a much stronger link with their traditional culture and with the land than a lot of other indigenous communities in Australia have been able to achieve. It was from an island in the Torres Strait that the native title issue first emerged. It was a former resident of Murray Island who initiated the action, firstly against the Queensland government and subsequently in the High Court of Australia, to assert his and his community's rights over the land in the Torres Strait, on Murray island, the island of Mer. That needs to be understood very clearly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of the Torres Strait have maintained their traditional activity and their cultural identity with their land probably more than a lot of other indigenous communities, apart from a number of communities in the Northern Territory. If we had let them run their own affairs and be in control of their own communities from the start, then I do not think we would have had the alarming health statistics we have had put before us on a regular basis regarding the dramatic way Torres Strait Islanders and Aboriginal Australians are suffering. I have examples here from a paper that was delivered to the Torres Strait health workshop in April of last year, a paper called, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Our health, our future, our decision</EMPHASIS>. It talks about mortality statistics. Life expectancy for Torres Strait Islanders is some 20 years less than it is for other Australians. The average age of death for males is 55.7 years. It declined in the years 1980 to 1989 from what it was in the years 1970 to 1979. So the mortality rates for people from the Torres Strait are worsening, not improving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For females in the Torres Strait the average age of death in the decade 1980 to 1989 was 48.8 years, which is almost 30 years younger than the average Australian mortality rate. Both sides of the House should be ashamed of those statistics. They have not come about because of the last five years of the Queensland Government or the last 10 years of the federal government. This situation has developed over the last 200 years of our administration of indigenous affairs in this country. It is not something that I am proud of. It is certainly something that I am committed to trying to correct. It is not something that we can score political points on. It is something that both sides, when we have been in power at state and federal level, have failed to adequately address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are doing in this legislation is saying to the Torres Strait Islanders, `We have failed. We should be giving the authority to you to see if you can do a better job than we seem to have been able to do.' It is an issue that we have regularly addressed in this House. I chair the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. In our report that was tabled last year in the parliament, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Access and equity: rhetoric or reality?</EMPHASIS>, which was a report on our inquiry into the implementation of the access and equity strategy, we made a number of recommendations with regard to access to mainstream health, housing, employment, education and other services for indigenous Australians, and in particular for people in the Torres Strait. I quote from this report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Access to adequate health services is a basic right but one which is denied to many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Evidence was given by ATSIC that 80 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are reliant on mainstream services, and yet the committee heard significant evidence that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people do not receive equitable access or reasonable treatment in most mainstream health services. it can therefore be concluded that this has resulted in many Aboriginal and Islander people not receiving adequate health care.</PARA>
<PARA>That is very much evidenced by the information we have got from the Torres Strait. Last year during our hearings in the Torres Strait we were told that Torres Strait Islander communities have spent on them only 50 per cent of the amount that all Australians living on mainland Australia, in Queensland for example, have spent on them. When you take into account the fact that the islands of the Torres Strait also have severe water problems, severe housing shortages, overcrowded housing, severe employment problems, and large numbers of Torres Strait islanders with no access to mainstream employment, it is a severe indictment on the performance of successive governments in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that with the formation of the Torres Strait Regional Authority we will have a genuine commitment from all political parties to give the people of the Torres Strait in the administration of their affairs under this authority some freedom to act properly and fully in the best interests of their own people. I hope that they will not be subjected to massive and corrosive questioning of every single decision and act they undertake, as unfortunately occurs too frequently in the examination of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing that members of the House of Representatives committee have come to appreciate is that Aboriginal organisations and Torres Strait Islander organisations are subjected to probably more than twice as much accountability as any other government department or community organisation. I do not in any way reject the requirement for accountability. Every taxpayer's dollar that is being spent needs to be clearly checked and accounted for to ensure that it is consistent with government policy and the community's expectations. I stand by that, and I believe that should be the same for Aboriginal organisations as for any other organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that it is fair that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and organisations are subjected to such vigorous, and often personal, inquiry and intimidation by some people with respect to over-justification for every single decision made. We are forcing Aboriginal organisations to spend twice as much of their money on management and supervision as we expect other organisations to expend. Therefore, we are taking those valuable dollars and the time of those Aboriginal organisations away from the actual delivery of services. That is not in the best interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people or of the taxpayers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the people elected to the Torres Strait Regional Authority will be the best placed to determine what is in the best interests of the Torres Strait Islander people. I do believe that they need to be accountable to their people for their decisions. I believe that they need to be accountable to the taxpayers of Australia for the expenditure of their money. But they should not be twice or three times as accountable as any other organisation. They should be as accountable as any other organisation. I believe that the Torres Strait Regional Authority would be very happy to be as accountable as, say, the Department of Social Security or some medical organisations to which we provide millions of dollars in research funding. It should be as accountable as those organisations. Unfortunately, that has not been its experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make sure that the dollars that we provide to the Torres Strait Regional Authority to tackle these alarming health, employment and housing statistics are able to be spent on those priorities and that the organisations are not required to spend inordinate amounts of time responding to every little pedantic question raised for political purposes by a lot of people who have no particular concern for or interest in the welfare of indigenous Australians, but who are more interested in scoring cheap political points to pursue their own personal political careers. Unfortunately, that has been the pattern in the past. I hope that it will not be the pattern in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I sincerely hope that the Torres Strait Regional Authority is given the freedom and the true flexibility to tackle the issues before it and that it will be accountable to its own people. The first and most important level of accountability is that the people of the Torres Strait believe that their regional authority is working in their best interests and that it is expending the moneys the way that it should. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second most important thing is that we have to make sure that the regional authority gets sufficient financial resources to perform its tasks. That is this government's responsibility, and it is also the Queensland government's responsibility. Both governments need to work together to make sure that that authority is given sufficient funding to tackle those important issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I comment briefly on the recent suggestions of the Premier of Queensland, Wayne Goss, and the Queensland Minister for Family Services and Aboriginal and Islander Affairs, Anne Warner. Their suggestion is that Aboriginal and Islander Affairs should be fully transferred over to the Commonwealth's responsibility. I support that. I believe that that is a very reasonable objective, but that will not avoid continuing responsibility of all state governments in areas where the Commonwealth does not and could not provide services to Aboriginal and Islander people, such as in education and access to employment in the state public service. It does still mean that the Queensland government or other state governments are responsible for providing roads which Aboriginal and Islander people will want to access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One also has to appreciate that 70 per cent of indigenous Australians live in urban communities and that they are part of the mainstream community, as far as their access to health services, hospitals, schools and things like that are concerned. They will still require access to those mainstream services, regardless of whether they are provided by state governments, local governments or Commonwealth governments. Although I support the planning and policy determinations occurring at the Commonwealth level in principle and although I believe that the Commonwealth should fully fund community health services and other specific services that are targeted purely at remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, there can be no complete withdrawal from the services to Aboriginal and Islander Australians by state governments, even if that policy determination process is handed over to the Commonwealth. We cannot differentiate in mainstream Australia and say to an Aboriginal person, `The Commonwealth is now responsible for you. You can't go to our local state school or our local hospital.' Therefore, Aboriginal people will still be getting access to state services and local services in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real problem is that state and local governments are not meeting their responsibilities to a lot of Aboriginal communities. They will not avoid their responsibilities by saying, `Oh, well, we wipe our hands of Aboriginal people; they're all the Commonwealth's responsibility.' I certainly agree that there should be national planning and that the Commonwealth should be setting national targets for a whole range of areas, but I still do not believe that state and local governments can avoid any responsibility for delivering services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very important bill for the people of the Torres Strait. It is a landmark piece of legislation. I sincerely hope that it will receive strong support from all sides of this House and the Senate. I sincerely hope that the Torres Strait Regional Authority will be given the opportunity to fulfil its charter, as set out in this legislation and in the proposals that it has before it, without unnecessary political interference from people who wish to use the question of accountability to pursue their own political agendas rather than as a genuine concern for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to follow the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) in this discussion on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill, which is an important piece of legislation. The honourable member for Moreton is well known for his deep commitment to the cause of Australia's Aboriginal people and his genuine desire to see our Aboriginal Australians share more fully the wonderful opportunities that our country offers. While we may disagree on occasions as to how those objectives should be achieved, I certainly share his strong view and his desire to see a far better lot for Australian Aborigines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also noted his comment on the suggestion that Aboriginal affairs should be transferred entirely to the Commonwealth. For all the reasons which the honourable member for Moreton put up, I would come to the opposite conclusion. I believe that it is appropriate that the states should continue to take a particular interest in Aboriginal affairs and develop necessary programs to ensure that Aboriginal Australians have proper health services, better education and a much better standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, I do not think there is much evidence to suggest that Commonwealth programs have been any more successful in Aboriginal matters than state programs. While we all want to talk together, reach common objectives and endeavour to develop programs that are worth while, I do not believe that any central Commonwealth agency is likely to be more successful in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is beyond question that aspects of Australia's policy towards its Aboriginal people have not been successful or satisfactory and have failed not only Aborigines but, indeed, all Australians. There needs to be a genuine debate in the community about what can be done to improve the situation. There is a universal desire and agreement to achieve better results for Aborigines. Sadly, we have not got a great record as far as that is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular piece of legislation attempts to assist the Torres Strait Islander sector of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community in developing a better regional system. I hope it is successful in that regard. Frankly, outward organisations will not of themselves achieve too much. There has to be a genuine commitment from both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians to achieve better results, and there has been little evidence of that to date in many areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation deals with, amongst many other things, suggested changes to the election regulations which apply to ATSIC. I want to use this debate, therefore, to review some of the results of the 1993 ATSIC elections. Those election results and the conduct of those elections are an acute embarrassment for the Australian electoral system. At a time when we are going around the world as electoral advisers, when we are supervising elections in other countries, what happened in the 1993 ATSIC elections is a very poor example to the rest of the world. Many Third World countries would be ashamed to have an election conducted in the way our 1993 ATSIC elections were conducted, and would be ashamed at many of the allegations of irregularity and the concerns about the overall outcome of those elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1993 ATSIC elections chose 573 regional councillors from a total of 2,001 nominations. However, only 45,820 of the estimated 147,500 eligible Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people actually voted. There were some 480 polling places and around 400 mobile booths. A turnout of only 32.15 per cent is obviously the first point of concern. There is an immediate difficulty with all of the figures because there is no roll of who is eligible to vote at ATSIC elections. The general electoral roll is used, and then there is some arbitrary system to determine who, amongst the eight or 10 million Australians on that roll, are actually able to vote at ATSIC elections. That system of itself is open to widespread abuse and there are many concerns about who was allowed to vote at this election and who was not allowed to vote. While we have a system where there is no specific roll, those difficulties will continue to arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the reason why there is no roll is that there is no real definition of who is an Aboriginal. There has been some debate about what proportion of Aboriginal blood a person should have before being entitled to be called an Aborigine. Frankly, I do not think that offers an appropriate solution to whatever difficulties arise in determining Aboriginality. But neither does the current system which basically says that, if a couple of people agree that someone is an Aborigine, then he is. That particularly causes difficulty where there are hotly contested elections and where the eligibility for individual people to vote is subject to dispute. So the very identification of 147,500 people who might be eligible to vote at ATSIC elections is in the beginning a debatable figure and one which is seriously open to disputation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, the Australian Electoral Commission, the body charged with running all of the federal elections in Australia and charged with running the ATSIC elections, came to a conclusion that 147,500 people were eligible to vote in this series of ATSIC elections. As I mentioned before, only 45,820 of those people bothered to turn up to vote. The voter turnout ranged from as little as 8.5 per cent in Sydney to 106.2 per cent at Mornington. Any election that produces a 106 per cent turnout must also leave people asking a lot of questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only explanation that the Electoral Commission was able to offer in relation to that unexpectedly large turnout was that more people turned up than were expected. It is obvious that more people than expected turned up, but why did 106 per cent of the expected Mornington enrolment vote? How many people voted who should not have voted? Why was the Electoral Commission so out of touch with the number of people who should vote in an electorate like Mornington? With as little as 8.5 per cent turnout in Sydney and as much as 106 per cent turnout in another electorate, alarm bells should have been ringing immediately in the minds of those who were conducting the elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking around the various states, the turnout in New South Wales was just 20.78 per cent; Victoria, 19.02 per cent; Queensland, 35.74 per cent; Western Australia, 40.25 per cent; South Australia, 25.66 per cent; Tasmania, 16.43 per cent; and Northern Territory, the best of the lot, perhaps not unsurprisingly, 51.19 per cent. So around Australia there was just a 32 per cent turnout. But there is worse. Of the votes of those 45,820 who bothered to turn up, 6,000 were rejected by the commission and a further 2,000 were declared informal. That leaves us with just over 33,000 formal votes in an election which was supposed to involve 147,500 Aborigines; that is around a 20 per cent formal vote. One really has to question the legitimacy of an election that produces a 20 per cent formal vote nationwide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look specifically at some of the electorates, the news is even more alarming. In the electorate of Nhulunby South in the Northern Territory, four ATSIC counsellors were elected from only 10 formal votes. There were an estimated 845 voters in that particular ward of whom 489 actually voted. However, 477 of the 489 were rejected and another two were treated as informal. Any election which produces only 10 formal votes out of an enrolment of 845 is farcical and an appalling indictment on those organising the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In southern Queensland only 16 per cent of the 9,000 estimated voters in the Brisbane area bothered to vote, and 28.4 per cent of the 4,500 estimated voters in the Rockhampton region, which includes the coastal areas of my own electorate, lodged a vote. In the Roma area, which includes the western part of my electorate, there was a turnout of 44.2 per cent of the 3,400 eligible voters. I have received a number of complaints from constituents about the elections conducted in that area. Constituents of ATSIC regional wards are also constituents of federal members of parliament. I have been approached by a number of people who are concerned about the way in which the elections were conducted and, in particular, the elections in their area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the difficulties that arises is that, while there are 480 polling places, as I understand it, there is no provision for postal voting for ATSIC elections. In my own electorate many people are obliged to travel several hundred miles to their nearest ATSIC polling booth, or they have to rely on the mobile polling booths which breeze through communities, often with seemingly little notice or advice. If Aborigines who are eligible to vote are not there on the day, they miss out on that voting opportunity. Frankly that is not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the people who were eligible to vote feel disenfranchised. They were faced with the option of either being in their community on a particular day or travelling several hundred miles to the nearest polling booth. There needs to be a better system to ensure that all those who are eligible to vote have that opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also allegations of voting irregularities. I shall not be able to go into those in detail today because some of them are the subject of appeals to the courts, so I guess they are sub judice. Many of them are very serious allegations which go to the core of an honest and fair voting system. The many allegations of rank corruption associated with the ATSIC elections put the legitimacy of the results in question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even with the poor voter turnouts, something like 10 per cent of all of the votes cast were rejected and a further 5 per cent were declared informal. In my own area, the three local regions elected a total of 54 ATSIC councillors, yet few people are satisfied with the end result. I understand that something like 10 of the election results are now under challenge in the courts. With that number in question, many may argue that the whole election should be nullified and conducted again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians should be alarmed that these elections were conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission&mdash;the same body that is charged with conducting all federal elections in Australia. The cost of the elections was something over $4 million, or more than $100 for every vote received. Many of the allegations of voting irregularities are directed towards Electoral Commission staff. There are suggestions that many of the staff gave incorrect information to those wishing to vote and that that is the reason why many of the election votes were rejected. When false information is given in some electorates to voters about how to cast their votes, one wonders what happens in other places where there are fewer challenges and less obvious concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Irregularities seem to have been widespread, so much so that the Electoral Commission is actually lodging some of these challenges in the courts. The AEC was given $4 million to conduct the elections but it is incurring further expense by filing petitions in the Federal Court challenging election outcomes which appear to have resulted from its own mistakes. ATSIC shares many of these concerns about the conduct of the poll, the discrepancies, the poor training and briefing of staff on election day, and the general poor standard of conduct of the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other matter of concern is the extraordinary time taken to count the votes. Even though fewer than 46,000 votes were cast around Australia, it took six weeks to count the votes in most electorates. It took 41 days to count just 66 votes in Deniliquin in New South Wales; that is not a distant, remote area, it is an urban town. It took 48 days to count 91 votes at Coober Pedy. The figures in other places are similar. Many weeks were taken even in the capital cities to count the votes once they had been cast. All of this gives rise to suspicion about the nature and the validity of the ATSIC election processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill makes some amendments to ATSIC's electoral laws, but it will not do anything to resolve the sorts of issues that have caused widespread concern in the Aboriginal community arising out of the 1993 elections. We have had observers in South Africa and in Cambodia during elections, allegedly giving advice about the way in which fair and free elections can be conducted. Our own ATSIC elections have been a very poor example and advertisement for our electoral processes. There needs to be a thorough reform of the way in which ATSIC regional councillors are elected, of the electoral processes involved, and of the system we use to determine who is eligible to vote in particular wards, who is eligible to vote in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander elections per se, and the way in which people are chosen to represent Aboriginals in their various regional and national bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) should act to restore some credibility to ATSIC as a group by giving serious consideration to ordering a new poll for new elections to ensure that those who are representing the Aboriginal people are seen to be doing so on the basis of free and fair elections. Much needs to be done to reform this system. This legislation only tinkers at the edges and fails to address those significant issues. Frankly, if ATSIC is to have any credibility, it has to have the confidence not only of the broad Australian community but particularly of the Aboriginal population itself. The Aboriginals who talked to me about the results of this recent poll have anything but confidence in the way these elections were conducted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to look at this matter once again, particularly following the review of the court hearings in relation to the at least 10 results that are under question. We need to consider seriously whether whole new elections should be ordered to ensure that the people elected to represent Aborigines are indeed those whom they want to be their representatives. </PARA>

I wish her well in her work with ATSIC. It still has a lot of work to do, as we all do in this parliament, in addressing the problems that face our Aboriginal people today. This bill is extremely important in continuing the commitment by this government to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It specifically refers to the role of the Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week I had the opportunity to visit the Torres Strait with my colleague the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd), who will be speaking later in this debate, where we met with a number of people. We really need to go out first-hand and visit these people and talk to them about problems that they have, for example, in the area of health. I think we need to be very cautious and very aware of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned the accountability of ATSIC. I have looked at a couple of Commonwealth community development employment programs, CDEPs, which are well known in many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.

I was amazed when the people there told me that about $700,000 a year is spent on the CDEP but it is costing them $100,000 a year to maintain their accountability requirements. That proportion, 14 per cent, is a very large amount of money to be spent servicing the accountability requirements of the CDEP. They are the sorts of things that we need to be aware of to ensure that the people who are delivering these services under the CDEP can be supported without that sort of money being dragged out of the funds that are contributed to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1994 is important to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. This bill gives us the opportunity to show some much needed bipartisan support for an area that often does not receive such agreement because many people perceive it as controversial. Today we have not seen that sort of support. It is very unfortunate that someone would be foolish enough to act this way in this debate. I think it is fair to say that, unfortunately, since the passing of the Mabo decision, just about anything in the field of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs that receives publicity is seen by the public as controversial, whether it deserves it or not. In most cases it certainly is not. </PARA>

There is no doubt about that; it is true that they are getting something that they do not deserve. They are getting poor health, high mortality rates, high incarceration rates and all the attendant tragedies that follow the loss of cultural identity and independence.

He is very cooperative and very responsive to the needs of these people. There have been massive changes under his government. He is certainly aware of the comments made by the honourable member for Moreton regarding the need to maintain the mainstream services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, 20 July this year marks the 20th anniversary of the invasion of the Republic of Cyprus. Cyprus is a member of the Commonwealth, as is Australia. This invasion, illegal and condemned, is still extant. As honourable members will be aware, the island of Cyprus has a mixed Greek Orthodox and Turkish Moslem population. The modern legal basis for the constitutional arrangements on the island of Cyprus is the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923. This treaty was one of many that followed the First World War and dealt with the problems left over by the collapse of four empires after 1918.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By this treaty, Cyprus was recognised as having been annexed by Britain. Both Greece and Turkey signed the treaty. Turkey also renounced any rights or claims on the island of Cyprus. However, this legal basis has been ignored by Turkey, which has resorted to illegal violence against Cyprus. Not only has the Treaty of Lausanne been broken, but the UN General Assembly has been ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974 and the forcible division of the island by Turkish troops, the United Nations has adopted more than 50 resolutions and decisions regarding the Cyprus problem. These resolutions relate to the central issues of the Cyprus question such as the withdrawal of Turkish troops from the island; the return of citizens to their homes and properties; a proper accounting for the fate of the 1,619 Greek Cypriots, as yet, unaccounted for; the implementation of basic human rights and fundamental freedoms such as the freedom of movement, freedom of settlement and the return of property; and, finally, the re-establishment of the security, sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity of the Republic of Cyprus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is high time that these issues were addressed by Turkey in a serious and constructive way. Australia can help this process by, at the very least, seriously raising, with the Turkish authorities, the question of property return for Australian citizens in Cyprus who have been robbed by the Turkish army. Until now, Turkey has refused to cooperate with the United Nations resolution on Cyprus and still, 20 years later, has an army of occupation on Cyprus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go into details about the desecrated churches used as toilets, the murdered clergy and the raped women. I will not delay the House with tales of priests crucified on the doors of their churches or farmers burned to death in their own homes. All wars are appalling in their brutality. But this war is still going on. The aggressor still commits international crimes against the innocent Greeks of Cyprus. Not only does Turkey refuse to cooperate in the humanitarian efforts required to account for the 1,619 missing Greeks, but by bringing onto the island 80,000 settlers from Turkey, protected by 35,000 Turkish soldiers, a policy of ethnic cleansing has been introduced, by Turkey, into Cyprus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an era when the Berlin Wall has collapsed, the continued division of Cyprus is an affront to all sense of decency. Of course, prior to 1974 the Turkish minority in Cyprus had grievances. However, grievances are alleviated by politics, not by mass murder, theft and military occupation. Would anyone say that the situation for the Turkish minority on the island of Cyprus is now better than it was in the years before 1974? Of course, it is not. So what is to be done?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has a large and peaceful immigration from both Greece and Turkey. The sons and daughters of Greece and Turkey have come to Australia, found peace and prosperity and live amicably together in Australia. We demonstrate that Greeks and Turks can live harmoniously. On the basis of this evidence, and our membership of the Commonwealth, I would call on the government of Australia to take a higher profile in trying to find a way out of this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The foreign affairs department is rightly proud of its efforts in Cambodia. It worked hard and effectively in that country. I am confident that a similar effort could be made towards Cyprus. Australia has excellent relations with Greece, Turkey and the government of Cyprus. We have no great power political ambitions in the area. I believe that we could, if we actually wanted, make a difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The long-term welfare of all people on Cyprus requires an end to military occupation and a return to the rule of law in a unitary Cypriot state. The sorrows and tragedies of 20 years will never be calmed until this happens. Along with my fellow Australians of Greek descent, I mourn the losses and sufferings of the last 20 years. I call on the Australian government to take a greater interest in this continuing tragedy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All my life I have lived at the foothills of the Bunya Mountains. From my verandah they dominate the view and I have always admired the Bunyas as one of the especially beautiful parts of Australia. The mountains take their name from the magnificent bunya pine trees which grow in the area&mdash;some of which are thought to be as much as 500 years old.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bunya Mountains National Park covers more than 11,700 hectares and is perched on the top of the Great Dividing Range, reaching an elevation of over 1,100 metres at Mount Mowbullan and Mount Kiangarow. The national park is divided between three local authority areas and three federal electorates. I share the area with the members for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) and Fisher (Mr Slipper). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Great Dividing Range is the watershed between the coastal regions and Australia's vast inland. Rain falling on the eastern side of the Bunya Mountains National Park drains into the Queensland coastal rivers while run-off on the western side enters the Murray-Darling system and, eventually, the ocean in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About every two or three years the bunya pines produce giant pods of nuts about the size of a football which when ripe fall to the ground. In early days, Aborigines travelled hundreds of miles to meet and feast on the bunya nuts and perform corroborees. It is reported that tribal warfare and disputation would even cease during the bunya festival, though the Aborigines thought the area was haunted by evil spirits and so travelled down the mountains in the evening to sleep. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1870s, loggers began felling the giant bunya pines, red cedar and the other timber on the mountains. A huge timber industry was established. In 1908, the Queensland government set the Bunya Mountains aside as a national park. It is the second oldest national park in the state. A large state forest provides a buffer zone around the park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Bunya Mountains have always been highly prized as a picnic area, holiday destination and scenic wonderland. My forefathers were among the local citizens who helped push the initial roads into the area and develop picnic areas. Over more recent decades, national park rangers have done a wonderful job in caring for the area and upgrading visitor facilities. A large team of volunteers and several local organisations which support the work of the park staff conduct visitor programs and encourage and work on the conservation of the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Not all the scenic features are in the area of the national park. The adjoining Russell Park was donated to the people of the Wambo shire by the Russell family many years ago. There is the adjoining state forest, though there has been no logging for almost 40 years, and quite a lot of privately owned freehold land with a growing population of permanent residents, rental accommodation and tourist facilities. There can be no questioning the local commitment to preserving and enhancing the park on behalf of all Australians so that it will always be available for future generations to enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> However, local residents are angry that the federal and state governments may be about to nominate the Bunya Mountains areas for the World Heritage List. Two well attended public meetings, one at Bell, on the western side of the park, and the other at Kumbia, on the eastern side, voted overwhelmingly&mdash;220 votes to four&mdash;to oppose World Heritage listing. Even a survey of hand-picked respondents, conducted with the guidance of Dr A. Keito of the Rainforest Conservation Society, could not produce a majority in support of World Heritage listing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All three local authorities in the region and the South Burnett Local Authorities Association, along with a wide range of farming and community groups, have also indicated their opposition to placing the region on the World Heritage List. These people know and love the area and have a deep commitment to its protection and maintenance. They have been prepared to devote their own time, efforts and money to care for the region in the past and they want the current system of management and care to continue. They have looked with horror at what has happened in some of the other World Heritage areas, such as the Willandra Lakes, North Queensland wet tropics and Fraser Island, and they do not want that kind of interference, bungling and heavy-handed bureaucracy imposed on their communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is concern that the rich agricultural lands which surround the park will have farming practices regulated by remote academics who have little or no appreciation of farm life and the hopes and aspirations of the community. There is an urgent need to improve access and provide better services and facilities on or near the Bunya Mountains. However, World Heritage listing will produce no new infrastructure funding and no better care for the national park; it will just produce a tangled web of complicated and restrictive management plans. At this stage, neither the federal nor the state governments have made any announcement that they intend to nominate the area. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier this year, after a weekend in the Brindabellas, the federal coalition emerged identifying law and order as a major issue for the people of Australia.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My Government stands for the right to feel safe and secure with all guarantees, benefits and protection that the law can provide, administered with firmness, fairness and compassion.</PARA>
<PARA>They are fine words.

In no way do I reflect upon police officers&mdash;the people who safeguard the community and who uphold the law.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I refer today to the resignation of the New South Wales Minister for Police, Terry Griffiths.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What scandal is hidden beneath this latest announcement? Who knows. All we can get from the Premier who demands only the `highest standards' of his ministers is a comment such as:</PARA>

<PARA>Mr Fahey of course would not elaborate on the circumstances surrounding the resignation, but he did say he was aware that Mr Griffiths's manner of dealing with some staff members had caused them considerable and unnecessary stress. Mr Fahey said five of Mr Griffiths's female staff members were on stress leave. He then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can't take it further than that without there being a further complaint.</PARA>
<PARA>The obvious question is: whom is the Premier of New South Wales protecting? Mr Griffiths? Perhaps, but he has lost his job. The staff? That is unlikely&mdash;they are on leave. The people of New South Wales? He has expressed concern about them, so much so that he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is every person's right to feel safe and secure in going about his or her business&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>everyone, that is, unless they happen to be a staff member working for the Minister for Police and Emergency Services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's action by the Premier of New South Wales plumbs a new depth in political accountability. His major concern is for himself. We have seen a police minister shuffled onto the back bench, and a former police minister who was sacked because he misled parliament brought back into the ministry. Let us not forget why Mr Pickering was sacked. He resigned because he misled parliament following a row with Police Commissioner Tony Lauer about the attempted police cell suicide of Victorian teenager Angus Rigg. We all know the fiasco that that was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have now the Premier safeguarding a colleague because he knows he cannot survive without him on the back bench. He refuses to call a by-election in Parramatta, he refuses to ask Barry Morris to resign, and now he has to bring in an emergency minister for police in charge of a police force that is already undergoing a royal commission. The shame of it all is that the coalition at state and federal level claims it is concerned about law and order. </PARA>

Mr Oakley has brought to Australian rules football the same sorts of management practices. The AFL management today no longer has regard for those people who own the game. The people who own the game are families: families and children who go to the footy on a Saturday, buy a pie and sauce or a hot dog or whatever and dad would have a tinnie. They used to be able to stand in the outer and they used to be able to afford to go and watch their favourite team playing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, these days those at the Australian rules football are the elite. At most of the major grounds now there are glassed in, air-conditioned banquet rooms with white tablecloths and silver service. Those who are privileged, those who have taken over the game, sit back before the match starts in air-conditioned comfort, with good wines and three-course meals. The weather does not bother them, of course. The view is uninterrupted: they have angled plate glass in front of them with a wonderful view of the ground. Of course, they do not pay for their meal. They are invited guests of the club.

We all know that, for a variety of reasons&mdash;and I am not being critical&mdash;Sydney is a financial disaster as a football team.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is going to get to the stage where clubs like Port Adelaide will be denied admission to the AFL because the economic rationalism driving the AFL&mdash;the Oakley view of the world&mdash;is that it will try to get a composite side up because it means profit. The game that people love, the game that families want to go and see, is being lost because of those who see it as profit only, who see the game as a means of giving them big incomes and privilege behind plate glass windows with white tablecloths and silver service.

The Committee concedes, however, that some patients may benefit from Orap and also acknowledges the claim that Orap is better than other drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The presentation of convincing clinical data showing the efficacy of Orap is severely handicapped because professionals, cognizant of the cost burden, cannot consider prescribing Orap to patients who may benefit but who are barely surviving on their pensions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Testimony from the most relevant sources&mdash;sufferers taking Orap, and their carers&mdash;would expound the advantages of this medication over a wide range of other neuroleptics many of which, at best, induce numbing sedation and side-effects so intolerable that additional medication is necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Orap has enabled my son to regain his independence, rejoin the community and stay out of the psychiatric ward. Considerable savings to our Health system would be possible if more people could be kept out of hospital&mdash;not to mention the improvement in the quality of life for those unfortunate people afflicted with mental illness.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Ms. Lawrence,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1979 my Son was diagnosed as having Schizophrenia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1978 to 1989 he was treated by a local Psychiatrist and given various major tranquillisers but he did not respond to any of them and had frequent admissions to Hospital and was put on an Invalid Pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989 a Psychiatrist in Newcastle prescribed ORAP for him and his illness improved remarkably to the point where he was able to be employed as a Draftsman with an Engineering Firm. He is still employed, but due to the down turn of the building industry in this area is only employed when work is available so he is not at present receiving full wages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1989 when he commenced ORAP he has had no relapses of his illness or any hospital admissions, has married and is living a normal happy life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have written previously regarding the cost of ORAP. The burden for paying for the medication is great. The sufferer of Schizophrenia often lives with his mother who is also on a pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hon. Peter Staples M.P. wrote to me and suggested I discuss with my son's doctor whether other listed major tranquillisers would constitute suitable treatment for my son. From 1978-1989 we did just that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the Manufacturer or ORAP (Janssen-Cilag) was invited to submit to the Committee any scientific or medical data it may have but the data did not convince the Committee to change its view.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr Willis</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) This part of the honourable member's question has transposed the scheduled rate increases for leaded and unleaded petrol. The Budget measure scheduled increases in the excise rate on leaded petrol of 7 cents per litre by August 1994, whilst the rate on unleaded petrol was scheduled to increase by 5 cents per litre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In responding to this question, I draw the attention of the House to the Government's decision to contain the excise rate increase for fuel oil, heating oil and kerosene to just the 3 cents per litre which took effect on the night of the 1993-94 Budget and the further decrease by 1.977 cents per litre in this year's Budget, rather than the 5 cents per litre announced in the 1993-94 Budget and mentioned in (1)(d) of the honourable member's question.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated additional revenue from the excise increases for petroleum products, other than aviation fuels, is a gain in the following years of:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1994-95&mdash;$1363 million; 1995-96&mdash;$1446 million; 1996-97&mdash;$1515 million</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Successive governments have avoided publishing disaggregated estimates of petroleum product collections such as sought in parts (a), (b), (c) and (d) of question (1), as such estimates are likely to be less accurate than the aggregate estimate. I intend to maintain this practice of publishing only aggregate forecasts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The excise revenue collected from petroleum products in 1992-93 was:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Motor spirit&mdash;$4462 million; Diesel&mdash;$2646 million;  Fuel Oil&mdash;$56 million</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The collections data in 1992-93 and earlier years did not differentiate between leaded and unleaded petrol, as there has not previously been any difference in excise treatment of the two products. The amount collected from diesel is a gross figure which does not reflect the rebates paid under the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme (DFRS) to eligible primary production, mining and other activities (such as nursing homes and residential use).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Government has undertaken an analysis of the impact on various industry sectors of the total package of indirect tax measures announced in the 1993-94 Budget. The measures analysed include the package of proposed changes to the excise and sales tax systems announced in the 1993-94 Budget, but do not reflect later changes to the Budget measures (other than the increase in the low income rebate to $150). The results of this analysis were tabled in the Senate on 7 September 1993. However, the analysis was not undertaken separately for each individual Budget measure, such as the excise rate increase for each petroleum product. There would be no value in undertaking such a partial analysis on each individual measure. For example, it is not possible to present results according to the different impacts on industry costs of changes to excise on leaded petrol and unleaded petrol, as there is no basis on which to determine the use of leaded versus unleaded petrol in each industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Petroleum product excise is collected from petroleum distributors well before the products are sold to final consumers, whether they be a householder or a commercial user. Therefore, the revenue data for petroleum excise do not provide information about the excise payments actually made by various industry sectors in 1992-93. Nor is it possible to estimate such payments on the disaggregated basis requested, for the reasons given in the answer to (3).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) I understand that the prices of a number of energy products, including natural gas, may be tied to the prices of alternatives, including crude oil, fuel oil, diesel or a basket of petroleum products in some contracts. I do not have an overview of all contracts for natural gas supply and do not know how many of them may explicitly involve a linking of natural gas prices to other fuel prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) Excise collection data are not sufficiently detailed to allow analysis of the excise paid on individual petroleum products by water transport and various elements of rail transport. (See the answer to question 4 above.) However, the Industry Commission's Report on Rail Transport estimated that railways pay approximately $120 million per annum in excise taxes (Report No 13, 21 August 1991).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) As the answers to (4) and (7 indicate, it is not possible to make disaggregated forecasts on the basis of excise collection data for each aspect of industry identified in this question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) As the answer to (3) indicates, an assessment has been undertaken of the effect of the total package of indirect tax measures announced in the 1993-94 Budget on industry sectors including transport and storage, agriculture and mining. But that analysis does not attempt to calculate separate, disaggregated estimates for the effects of any individual excise change.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr Willis</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The issue of financial compensation to State Governments by the Commonwealth in the implementation of microeconomic reform has arisen in a number of contexts. These are: tax compensation following full or partial privatisation of State Trading Enterprises (STEs); compensation to the States for loss of dividends and tax equivalent payments (due to loss of monopoly rents) as a result of exposing their STEs to competition; and case-by-case assistance to encourage States to implement specific reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the July 1993 and March 1994 Premiers' Conferences, the Commonwealth and State and Territory Governments have agreed on the following arrangements for tax compensation to State and Territory Governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On a case by case basis, and so as to ensure that no State or Territory or the Commonwealth will be financially advantaged or disadvantaged, the Commonwealth will provide:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) compensation in relation to income tax and wholesales tax (WST), for State Trading Enterprises (STEs) which are partially privatised and for trading enterprises which are jointly owned by the Commonwealth and one or more States and Territories;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) compensation in relation to WST, where an STE is fully privatised; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) compensation in relation to income tax, for no more than one bank or insurance office in each State or Territory where the privatisation of the bank or insurance office commences before 1 July 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth will also consider compensation, on a case-by-case basis, so as to ensure that no State or Territory or the Commonwealth will be financially advantaged or disadvantaged in relation to income tax where an STE is fully privatised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue of compensation to the States for loss of dividends and tax equivalent payments has been raised in the context of implementation of the Hilmer Report on National Competition Policy. At the 25 February Council of Australian Governments (COAG) meeting, the Commonwealth advised that, in the context of agreement to the Hilmer competition policy principles, it would consider assistance to the States and Territories for loss of monopoly rents and the process for managing adjustment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth has in certain cases provided assistance to State Governments in order to progress specific microeconomic reforms. For example, in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> the Commonwealth set aside $100 million for the upgrading of interstate electricity transmission links in return for the States committing to satisfactory grid arrangements. While no firm projects have emerged warranting investment of this amount, the Commonwealth remains committed to provide funds for further upgrading of grid interconnections where there is economic justification. Some funds have been allocated to a feasibility study of a high voltage transmission link between NSW and Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth also provided the largest share of funding for the National Rail Corporation (NR), as part of a reform package for the loss making interstate rail business which had imposed a continuing drain on State rail authorities. In addition, the One Nation statement earmarked $454 million for rail infrastructure, from which State Governments as well as NR will benefit, on the proviso that NR negotiate a satisfactory enterprise agreement with the unions. NR's ground breaking agreement is expected to yield cost reductions of more than 35 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Given the wide range of compensation issues that are being dealt with, assessment of compensation is undertaken on a case-by-case basis depending on the context in which it arises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) In the context of the Hilmer competition policy proposals, the question of compensation for loss of monopoly rents and the process for managing adjustment will be discussed at the August 1994 COAG meeting but the Government does not envisage that compensation or financial assistance would need to be a continuing part of the normal COAG process.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr Willis</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) &amp; (2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My attention has been drawn to the article in question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years the Government's economic policy has included the objective of integrating the Australian market with the global economy and exposing local industries to international and domestic competitive pressures. The liberalisation of Australia's foreign investment policy has been part of the deregulatory and market reform initiatives. While foreign investment in Australia has increased, equity investment by Australians in overseas countries has increased at a faster rate over the past decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important part of the Government's foreign investment policy of welcoming direct foreign investment that is consistent with the needs of the Australian community is a screening process. Restrictions are applied in a few areas (for example developed residential real estate) where the Government considers that the net benefits to the Australian community are smaller. In the majority of industry sectors, however, smaller proposals are exempt and larger proposals are approved unless judged contrary to the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has traditionally been reliant on overseas savings&mdash;be they in the form of debt or equity&mdash;which is a reflection of our national investment needs exceeding our national savings. In other words, this has enabled national investment to have been higher than it otherwise would be. This is clearly beneficial for the Australian economy, providing the build-up in our net external liabilities (that is, external debt and equity) and the servicing costs thereon do not become excessive. In that regard, there is a greater reason to be concerned about increased external indebtedness&mdash;rather than equity inflow&mdash;because servicing debt involves a fixed contractual obligation, whereas equity financing is serviced only if the investment is profitable. Also the accumulation of external debt makes the Australian economy more vulnerable to external shocks and abrupt shifts in investor confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these circumstances, it would clearly be counter productive to try and curtail equity investments in Australia&mdash;particularly direct investment. Indeed, it would generally be preferable if foreign equity investment increased relative to borrowings from abroad. This makes the objective of stabilising foreign debt as a proportion of GDP less difficult to achieve than otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government policy does, however, aim to reduce our reliance on foreign savings by adopting policies that increase domestic savings and it is in that regard that the medium term budget deficit reduction strategy is important, as is the Superannuation Guarantee. The adoption of policies which make the Australian economy more competitive and productive will also help.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is committed to reducing the level of unemployment. The Government's White Paper on Employment, released by the Prime Minister on 4 May, reaffirms and strengthens this commitment. The package contains a commitment of more than $10.3 billion over four years to tackling unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The White Paper recognises that there is no alternative to economic growth as the basis for long-term job creation and reductions in unemployment. The Government's economic policy settings have contributed to sustained strengthening of economic growth in Australia. Substantial job growth has been achieved in the past year and a downward trend in the unemployment rate is already evident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over and above the growth objective, the White Paper demonstrates the Government's commitment to assist all of the unemployed, especially those who have been out of work the longest and disadvantaged groups. Some of the major new policy directions are listed below.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those who have been dependent on income support for over eighteen months the Government has created a Job Compact. The Job Compact will provide over one million labour market program places over the next four years, including more than half a million placements into jobs. These places will help the unemployed to re-establish contact with, and compete in, the labour market once more. For people unemployed the longest the Job Compact will break the vicious cycle of not being able to get a job without experience and not getting experience without a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The White Paper also provides additional assistance for those who are most at risk of becoming long-term unemployed. Case management, intensive job search assistance and early access to labour market programs will be provided to those identified as being at risk.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is fully committed to solving youth unemployment. To tackle this problem we have developed the Youth Training Initiative. This initiative will provide unemployed young people aged 15-17 with intensive case management and enough program places to ensure that they receive worthwhile employment or training. These and other measures will ensure that unemployed young people are given every chance to improve their employment prospects, both immediately and in the longer term.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To ensure that unemployment declines in the medium and longer term the Government will continue to implement responsible macroeconomic policy and promote microeconomic reform. To assist employers in creating jobs the White Paper contains programs specifically aimed at supporting them. These include improving the accessibility of CES services and the establishment of Employer Servicing Units. Employment and training opportunities in small business will receive a $6 million boost. Recognising the importance of small business employment, the White Paper has expanded the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme and made available the benefits of employing trainees through Group Training Schemes.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Better service will be provided to the unemployed by opening the CES to competition from private providers of case management services.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the RAS was introduced in January 1993, it was intended that it should act in concert with the commercial financial system and target assistance to long term viable farmers suffering from short term difficulties. The Government wished to encourage commercial lending institutions to work in close co-operation with the State RAS authorities and to share the responsibility of assessing a farmer's prospects of long term viability. It was considered that, during periods of exceptional circumstances, backing by a commercial lending institution would be an appropriate indicator of longer term viability.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is little evidence to suggest that legally binding intra-family loans, or vendor loans that are at arms length, are a significant element of overall rural debt.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes. The closing date for lodgement of tenders was 2.00 pm (Melbourne Time) on 4 June 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) No. The evidence used by the Bureau that prototypes met the requirements of the specification included the direct examination of equipment by Bureau staff and results of testing undertaken in accordance with requirements of the specification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The tender specification does not require that all information be provided at the time of submission of tenders and specifically states that the `Tenderer also shall submit samples of the equipment, if so requested, for independent testing by the Bureau'. Indeed, a number of Tenderers state in their submissions that additional technical information can/will be provided on request.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) No. The Bureau completed the tender evaluation in September 1993 and a tenderer for supply of the required equipment was recommended.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) All assumptions with respect to the costing of alternatives were based on material provided in the tender documents and were applied to all tenderers in an equitable manner.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) No. The selected equipment meets the requirements of the specification which was updated in March 1993. The selected tenderer has also offered a clear path of future equipment development. The contract specifically requires that the `Project Manager of the Bureau of Meteorology and the Contractor meet at 12 monthly intervals or within (1) month from the receipt of a written request from either party to review the specification and Quality Assurance implementation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) The normal practice in reviewing matters drawn to the Minister's attention about Departmental activities is, in the first instance, to refer the matter to the area of the Department concerned. In this case, on receipt of the initial complaints the tender process was reviewed by senior Bureau staff and found to be compliant with the Commonwealth Government Purchasing Guidelines. Subsequently, the procedures have also been reviewed independently by the Commonwealth's major purchasing authority, Purchasing Australia (part of the Department of Administrative Services) and the Commonwealth Ombudsman. Both provided assurances that the procedures were compliant with the Guidelines.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes. Proscar is the brand name of the drug finasteride.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) Proscar is indicated for the treatment and control of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia in patients who are not candidates for immediate surgery.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clinical studies indicate that finasteride results in a 14-20% reduction in prostate volume after 48 weeks of treatment in 50% of patients. This is compared to 20% of patients on a placebo.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) The drug is not listed under the PBS as applications for listing have been rejected by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The PBAC is of the view that the clinical place and value of finasteride in the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia remain unclear. The Committee considers that efficacy is modest and the real clinical benefit represented by small improvement in some measures (e.g. increase in urine flow) is difficult to assess. Furthermore, the cost to achieve these modest improvements is not favourable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The Government is unable to list a drug in the PBS unless it has been recommended by the PBAC, and as no exceptions for individual patients are available under the PBS, the Government cannot make the drug freely available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Several clinical trials of Proscar have been initiated in Australia.
