<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the first person this afternoon to rise in this place, on behalf of the coalition I protest at the restriction of time for this debate. I think it is appalling and outrageous that so many billions of dollars of expenditure which are to be considered in detail are to be considered under the rules governing this debate in such an abbreviated form.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outlays on employment and labour are expected to increase by some $524 million, or 15 per cent in real terms, in the coming financial year. This increase includes an estimated increase of $124.8 million in employment services flowing from Working Nation, reflecting increases in the Commonwealth Employment Service workload. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main disappointment of the white paper and the budget&mdash;and we have to take the two together when considering either of them&mdash;has been the complete failure to ensure an adequate and sustainable growth in jobs. This is a matter which has, of course, struck home very strongly to all those in the community involved in assisting the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Robert Fitzgerald, President of ACOSS, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . failure to ensure an adequate, sustainable growth in the number of available jobs is of particular concern.</PARA>
<PARA>The Salvation Army, in its comment, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The lack of job creation options is the greatest weakness of the statement.</PARA>
<PARA>The matter was well summed up by Professor Judith Sloane of the National Institute of Labour Studies, one of Australia's most distinguished labour market economists. She stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Instead of the White Paper being about jobs, jobs, jobs it is largely about unfunded assistance to the long-term unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, as business and the community have had the opportunity to consider what the budget funded programs mean for the long-term unemployed, there has been a growing level of concern that programs that, on their face, are aimed to assist may, in fact, offer very little assistance indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I quote, for example, from this morning's editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, the subject of which is the training award measures announced in the white paper and funded through the budget. This is an area where the government, to put it bluntly, stole the coalition's policies. Unfortunately it implemented them in a way in which they are simply not likely to be effective, and this was the point in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> editorial this morning. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the training award probably makes insufficient allowance for the lower productivity of trainees. The requirement that on-the-job training must be accredited will also restrict the use made of the training award by small- to medium-sized firms.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very serious statement because, if there are going to be increasing jobs, the great bulk of those jobs will be in small and medium sized enterprises. The fact that the ACTU has forced into the white paper and the budget its bureaucratic Carmichael agenda for training in Australia and has placed the emphasis in every case on accredited training to make use of the training award means that many small and medium sized enterprises will simply be unable to offer the training that is required under this award and hence will not be able to take up trainees. Anyone who believes that the budget and the white paper offer any solution to Australia's long-term unemployed; anyone who believes that these documents and these policies will provide jobs is simply not looking at the reality of what is happening in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1994-95 is the culmination of discussions that first started during the green paper process, continued through to the white paper, Working Nation, and were then put into the budget so that they could be implemented. During that time a whole host of consultations have occurred. I am sure that many members of the chamber would have done what I did, and that was to have local consultations in the run up to the white paper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regular theme that came across in consultation with individuals and groups in the local area was the need for, firstly, flexibility that allowed individuals a better pathway into all the programs that were available and assisted organisations in trying to match their innovative ideas with what they thought would be of benefit to the problem of unemployment. The second point is the complexity of the programs. That is not said by way of criticism; it is merely a statement of fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">DEET is trying to administer a whole host of labour market programs, and it is often very difficult to come to grips with the breadth of those programs. Given the range of programs, my concern is that often individuals slip through the net, or programs and suggested programs slip through the net, because we do not have a hole to match them up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major aspect of the white paper that was pleasing was the recognition of this need for flexibility; a recognition that, from the outset in trying to assist individuals who are unemployed, there should be some assessment of their needs and an attempt to match them to suitable training or work opportunities. Another aspect that I wish to touch upon is the notion of area consultative committees. I can envisage problems with area consultative committees in large urban areas like my electorate on the urban fringe of Melbourne. Sometimes in a more community based area that consultation would be lost because of the size of the region. I hope that we might see mechanisms put in place under the umbrella of the area consultative committees that can bring local communities together in an easier way. This will ensure that the disparate needs of a large area such as the north-east region of Melbourne are able to be well and truly involved in the type of consultations that were envisaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect is new work opportunities and the regional environment employment program, REEP. I was fortunate, through the work of the House of Representatives Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts, to go on an inspection to Lismore and to speak with representatives of Greening Australia. Greening Australia put quite a well thought out proposal to the government, through the white paper process, suggesting the REEP scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">REEP has one great advantage. It brings together a variety of already existing schemes and matches them to overall environmental plans. As Greening Australia clearly identified, there are two major problems that confront Australia&mdash;employment and the environment. It saw that this program could be used to its maximum advantage in tackling both problems by bringing together those two important aspects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the model that Greening Australia put up, which had an overall regional plan within which programs such as jobskills, LEAP and landcare programs could be brought together to meet these two problems&mdash;employment and the environment&mdash;was very important. Greening Australia is to be congratulated on formulating that idea. It has worked on some of its programs as a broker and sponsor of jobskills projects to achieve these aims. It has achieved not only valuable environmental outcomes but also valuable outcomes in the training of long-term unemployed people. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addressing the appropriations of the Department of Employment, Education and Training in consideration in detail, I would like to draw the attention of the House to two or three key areas. The first is literacy. Within this country many of us are very conscious of reports and surveys which have indicated that 25 per cent of people are functionally illiterate. When we come to have a look at why this occurs in a country such as ours I think we would all gasp at the fact that this situation has arisen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make that comment because so often we spend a lot of time saying we need to provide more resources for literacy&mdash;particularly in the primary school area, the early stages of education and so on&mdash;but we need to look at whether it is more to do with the methods of teaching people to read than needing more resources in the schools. I would support having more resources for literacy in those very early stages of primary education. That is the crucial stage at which people in our community learn this very important skill. If we miss out at that point, we find that it takes a tremendous amount of money to recapture people's capacity in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe there is a need to provide more resources in regard to literacy at that stage, but there is also a need for teachers at that level to give very careful consideration to the methods they are using. I believe all young people in this country can be taught to read effectively, but sometimes they are not being given the right instructions to help them on their way to achieving that very complex skill. Most of us pick it up reasonably easily, but there is a substantial proportion of our children who, as they come into school, find that skill quite complex. That is the area in which we need to address the issue of literacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I comment on is the difficulties that regional students have in Australia in getting tertiary education. Austudy is providing a basis for those young people to get to university. However, there is no doubt that students from farming families and from regional areas in Australia are severely disadvantaged when it comes to getting a tertiary education. When people have to move away from home and their families have to provide extra resources for their accommodation, it is very difficult for these families, particularly those in the $30,000 income area, to pay for accommodation for one or two students at university. The government needs to rethink this area so that there is some equity between urban and rural young people in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at the statistics and the percentage of young people who are able to go on to tertiary education, we notice that from the regional areas of Australia there is a dearth of young people coming on compared with the urban areas. There is no doubt that one of the reasons is financial. Families in regional Australia find it enormously difficult to provide an education for their children at the tertiary level. I say to the government that this is an area in which we can do much more for our young people than we are doing at this time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since its election in 1983, the federal Labor government has been committed to providing national leadership in the promotion of reforms in education and training to help Australia prosper in a rapidly changing and more technologically literate world. Unskilled jobs are disappearing. Young Australians now need to complete year 12 and go on to some sort of post-school study or training in order to compete in the job market. Increasing educational opportunities to allow them to do this has been a fundamental aim of Labor policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1983, year 12 retention rates have more than doubled, from 36 per cent to almost 80 per cent. Commonwealth expenditure on schools has increased in 1992 dollars from $1.8 billion in 1982 to almost $2.9 billion now. For government schools, the Commonwealth is providing $869 million in recurrent expenditure and $200 million for capital works in 1994. For the non-government sector, the amounts are $1.4 billion and $104 million respectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth has led the way towards recognition of the changing needs of employers and the benefits of a more simple and coherent training system based on competence rather than on time or process. The Australian vocational certificate training system, which will be implemented from 1 January next year, is intended to be the basis of a nationally coordinated system providing relevant and easily transferable skills for the majority of students whose career paths do not take them to university. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AVC will take account of the fact that Australia is one nation and not a loose confederation of independent states. Australia has a population the size of California's, making the idea of eight different education systems even more ridiculous than having differing railway gauges. This fact does not hold much sway with the states, however. The idea of a national curriculum framework, which the states themselves in 1991 decided to develop, hit the brick wall of conservative opposition in July last year when the education ministers met in Perth and decided to do some thinking about the whole idea. Some of them still seem to believe that a child undergoes a transformation when crossing the Murray or the Nullarbor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that time the national curriculum process has been, somewhat shakily, put back on track. However it is extremely disappointing that, although all states and territories are using the national curriculum statements and profiles as the curriculum framework for their schools, they have adapted them for their own use, which was expected, but failed to set up a mechanism to exchange their ideas and findings with each other. We may well end up with eight versions which differ significantly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same tunnel vision is apparent in the snail's pace at which vocational education reform is proceeding despite the Commonwealth's encouragement and massive funding support. This is depressing news for our young people and for Australia as a whole. It is a triumph for mediocrity at a time when we need vision, courage and imagination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ministerial Council on Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, which the Australian Education Council has become, is now nothing more than a political chess game in which the pawns are our children and this country's future. There are more examples of conservative education ministers failing to rise to the intellectual challenge. When they last met, in April this year, Bill Scales from the Industry Commission briefed the council on the review he is conducting into the efficiencies of national schools, a result of the last gathering of the Council of Australian Governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Scales gave a sophisticated and detailed overview of a complex issue. But when he invited questions he was confronted with silence&mdash;absolute silence on an inquiry which can shape the nature of Australia's schools for decades to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be true to say that the ministerial council achieved nothing at all of any importance. For people who actually run schools this could be considered a cause for relief. The one thing that all working teachers and their students should rightly fear in the schools is a minister surrounded by bureaucrats with blueprints for reform. But the  fact that some of the states want to bring progress and education reform to a complete stop should concern us all. Without debate and discussion, without new ideas being tossed around at the highest levels, our education culture will stagnate at the very time when we face our greatest challenges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This short-term and myopic view of most state governments regarding education matters should be of concern to all of us. Certainly, the view that education is a national issue requiring a partnership between federal and state governments, a view that any sensible observer would see as essential, is being severely tested by the states. Current parliamentary inquiries by the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training into accountability in Commonwealth-state funding arrangements in education and by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts into the issue of tied grants and their administration will focus on questions regarding the relationships between the Commonwealth and the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The states are long overdue for such scrutiny of their priorities and actions. We have a national responsibility to ensure accountability and a national focus for education at all levels. Commonwealth funding must be provided in an environment where national priorities are going to be met, not in a situation where state governments through inaction, incompetence or subterfuge subvert the continuing development of an education system capable of meeting the challenges of the next century. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The budget provided in its estimates for the white paper, which was announced a week before the budget. This white paper, along with the budget, has died and passed into the history of the parliamentary obscure. The white paper had as its premise a number of basically correct motives to get Australians working again. Like the many broken promises of this government, this is just another breach of faith to the Australian people, and more particularly to the unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government, led willingly by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), created the whole recent unemployment history. They created it, they then ignored it, they now fudge it and throw money at it&mdash;but they will never ever solve it because there is only one solution for the unemployed: jobs. This paper and its accompanying expenditure will not create those much needed jobs. This is a shame because the true believers, who have been hoodwinked by this government over many years, have been let down again by another broken government promise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already, the leading ministers have admitted that this white paper is not a jobs paper. The Prime Minister has said that it will make the unemployed jobs ready. I would suggest that anyone who has been out of work for 12 months would already be jobs ready and jobs keen. There are no jobs in this white paper. The Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) recently said on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program that the white paper was never intended to be a jobs paper, but rather a training paper. Again, there are no jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), in response to a question about a Cowan resident, said that he, the resident, will have a better chance with case management, training and subsidised employment prospects as a result of the white paper. This resident has actually had case management for the last three years, has completed retraining programs and has had subsidised jobs. But he still remains out of work, and he has done so for the last seven years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper is full of rhetoric and is based upon the need of the government to show that it has a so-called sharing, caring and fuzzy image. The illusion is beginning to wear thin to many Australians who are becoming tired of the government's broken promises and lack of action on the really important issues facing Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than mouth a Chifley rhetoric, why not excite the Australian community into solving this social problem? If the government is truly serious about solving the unemployment problem in Australia, it must first begin to recognise that the most important thing to do is to encourage employers to employ people&mdash;not bash them around the ears with IR legislation which is unworkable; not bash them over the head with taxes which they find difficult to pay; and not beat them into submission with so much regulation paper work that it promotes the thinking, `Why should I bother?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper should have included more strategies for our depressed regional areas. It should have been more positive in having an industry strategy. But it really does have some very positive initiatives&mdash;the parenting allowance, which sounds pretty good to me; the introduction of a training wage, which also sounds pretty good; the suspension of the training levy, which is also pretty good; and the shake-up within the department, which would be welcomed by a lot of people. These were very good ideas and initiatives. How strange it is that the government opposed them so vehemently last year when the Liberal Party brought them forward, but now the government is listening to us and actually including a lot of our ideas in its own legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where in this white paper are the apprenticeship training programs? Where is the encouragement for the youth of our country, which is the future of our country, to get out and get into the work force? There is none. There are no jobs in this particular white paper or, in fact, in the budget. The government has continued with its policy, `It is all too hard. Let us throw some money at it, and let us just hope for the best.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Working Nation is nothing more than an inferior offspring of the One Nation document&mdash;if honourable members can remember that; it has gone into obscurity as well&mdash;and, of course, Investing in the Nation. I do not know whether honourable members can remember when that was, but it was some time ago, and I cannot remember it. It did not work the first time, it did not work the second time, and it will not work the third time because this government is really full of rhetoric. It does not really develop policies that develop jobs, and what we need is jobs. I hope that those in the government who, with the white paper and the budget, are really delaying the prospect of creating jobs understand that, if they do delay longer, the electorate will ultimately repay them in the ballot box at the next election, which will probably be this year some time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the limited time available to me, let me say that the opposition simply never learns. It has been rejected now in every election since 1983. The reason that it was rejected in 1983 was that the Australian people, quite correctly, made the judgment that the opposition did not have the solutions to the problems that existed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1983 until the present time, the present government has been involved in a process of very significant restructuring. In the process of doing that, and in the process of recognising that we need to be more closely integrated and coordinated with a world economy, a number of strains have occurred within the economy. The government takes no comfort at all from the fact that there are still a very significant number of people unemployed. We are not tolerant towards it, nor should we be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to emphasise that, in the first seven years of the Labor government, between 1983 and 1990, 1.6 million new jobs were created. The opposition and the people who speak for the opposition seem all the time to have forgotten that. We have again set ourselves a target under the recent white paper and the budget, which together form a package of proposals, to increase the number of jobs in Australia by 500,000. Within the first 12 months, we have already increased the number of jobs by almost 200,000. It means, quite clearly, that we are on track in seeking to achieve that. </PARA>

The review states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without support from defence science and industry, the sustainability of our combat and combat support capabilities would be quickly eroded.</PARA>
<PARA>Support is provided by Australian industry through the repair, maintenance and adaptation of equipment. I want to address those remarks to the situation of Australian Defence Industries, which is located in the electorate of Bendigo. I have been endeavouring for some time to get a commitment from the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) to acknowledge what the government's situation is in relation to Australian Defence Industries. The minister wrote to me on 17 May 1994 and acknowledged the efforts of ADI management and of all of the staff in turning around the business operations of the former Office of Defence Production. His letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can assure you and the workers at the ADI Bendigo Facility that the Government does not want to see that effort wasted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the minister is still to consider the issue of privatisation of Australian Defence Industries. The minister is saying that that consideration by the government should occur later this year. That has created a feeling of anxiety amongst the 450 staff who work at that facility and who have put in a tremendous effort over the last few years to lift their performance and efficiency. At the moment they are feeling the strain. I think the government owes it to the staff at that facility to address the question of privatisation and make up its mind about what it is going to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Gulf War heightened everyone's concerns about what was happening with Australia's defence situation and the need for vigilance and to create a greater self-reliance for Australia in the defence area. Certainly the Gulf War did heighten the awareness of members of this House and of the Senate to the need for defence vigilance. My opinion is that it would be inappropriate for sensitive defence functions to be placed outside the government's control. In fact, the government acknowledged that with the Australian survey regiment recently, which is also in the electorate of Bendigo, when it went through its processes of the commercial support program and awarded the contract for future cartographic and mapping facilities for the defence forces to it. The Australian survey regiment in Bendigo will continue that fine work because of the sensitive defence functions that it performs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ADI plays a similar role in the manufacture of armaments and ordnance and has lifted its game, as I indicated to the House earlier, over a period of some years now. I have had contact with members of the staff and also the shop stewards at the ADI facility in Bendigo, stressing the need for the government to arrive at a decision on the issue of privatisation to ensure the continuity of work to those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ADI was recently awarded another major contract which will ensure continuity of work through that plant. The work they do in that engineering facility is of real quality, and involves a great deal of expertise. One of the things that they probably need to do&mdash;and the government needs to give them a lead in this&mdash;is to provide more training for technicians and apprentices in that ADI facility. Once people have gained the skills from that area they find that those skills are very marketable in the open market, should they happen to leave the Australian Defence Industries.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is indeed very appropriate that we are considering the defence side of the 1994-95 budget today, as it follows the commemoration of D-day which was acknowledged in this House yesterday. When we reflect, as we did yesterday&mdash;as did many people around the world&mdash;on the sacrifice of past generations to ensure our way of life today, we must acknowledge the fact that we can never afford to be complacent when it comes to providing for the defence of Australia. There is an old saying that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for the comments he made this morning in France, commemorating the part played by Australians in Operation Overlord and the D-day landings. Anyone who has followed the official commemoration over the last few days could not fail to be moved by the sacrifice, selflessness and bravery of past generations who endured the fiercest conflict the human race has ever known&mdash;the Second World War.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, many members of this parliament have parents who were involved in some way in World War II, and certainly many relatives and friends, and so it is entirely proper that we remember their commitment and realise that if the ceremonies in France mean anything it is that we can never take defence for granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for those reasons that I am pleased to say that the 1994-95 budget, in particular the defence budget, acknowledges this and sets out a well planned program of capital equipment purchasing, personnel training and support and strategic policy formulation. The defence budget follows on from the plans laid out in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic review 1993</EMPHASIS> and lays the foundation for the far-reaching changes that will be outlined in the white paper later this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total defence budget this year is $9,637 million, which represents 2.1 per cent of GDP and eight per cent of Commonwealth outlays. This represents only a slight reduction of 0.5 per cent from last year's figures, in line with the government's plans to reduce defence spending to two per cent of GDP by the end of the decade. This level of funding will enable defence to continue with its planned level of capital investment programs and ongoing schedule of exercises, deployments and training activities. The changes to funding arrangements will assist Defence in optimising the management of these major projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the member for Oxley, I am fortunate to represent nearly 3,000 air force personnel at the country's largest RAAF base, RAAF Amberley. The capital investment plans in the defence budget will have direct benefits for the region and the Amberley air force base. An amount of $71 million is being spent on the avionics upgrades for the F111s of Nos. 1 and 6 Squadrons at Amberley. The decision to provide funds for the F111 fleet is a welcome signal that it will continue as an integral part of Australia's defence plans, and will therefore be stationed at Amberley for a considerable period, bringing further development to the Ipswich region. As Amberley continues to grow and maintain its position as one of the premier defence establishments in the country, the Ipswich region will continue to reap significant economic and social benefits from having the base there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect of the defence budget that will benefit the region, and more importantly, the personnel and their families, is the new arrangements for the rephasing of the planned repayment of loans provided to the Defence Housing Authority. Previously, the Defence Housing Authority, known as DHA, was required to repay $120 million in 1994-95 and a further $120 million in 1995-96 through the sale of assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the new arrangements, Defence will provide an additional $120 million to the government in 1994-95, in place of the planned 1995-96 payment, and will then recover the funds from the authority over the following two years. This arrangement offers benefits to the DHA and to the defence department, as it will allow the DHA to proceed with the asset sales program while maintaining high quality, affordable housing for defence families. This will have direct benefits in my electorate of Oxley. As I said before, nearly 3,000 personnel and their families will directly benefit from the measures in this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures in this budget will certainly go a long way towards continuing the government's commitment to looking after defence personnel and their families, and the overall defence of this country. They certainly provide stability and security for the future of our defence forces and their families. I am very pleased to have had the opportunity to rise and support these estimates. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the very short time available in the consideration in detail stage I want to raise two issues relating to the defence appropriation. The first one relates to a debate in this place last year on the Social Security Amendment Bill (No. 2) involving fringe benefits tax payable on certain allowances to Australian Defence Force personnel. It is now history that that particular legislation went through the other place to a committee, and that that committee ruled, with the assistance of the Australian Democrat member, that the legislation should stand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Friday I and a number of my colleagues&mdash;I suspect on both sides of the House&mdash;read a report in the newspapers that an agreement had been reached between the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) and the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Punch) seemingly reversing the issue to some degree. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bevis) might, if he can, comment on this in his contribution to this short debate. The question from this side of the House is: to what extent does that amendment now affect the conditions of service of Defence Force personnel? What is the impact on defence appropriations in 1994-95, in particular?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point relates to something that I have raised in this place for over five years. Whilst not wanting to be known as the honourable member for Groom who raises nothing but the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> compensation cases, last week during question time I did ask the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) a question in relation to the legal standing of those cases, and it has a budgetary implication. I draw the attention of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), the minister at the table, and the attention of the parliamentary secretary to page 118 of Budget Paper No. 2 in relation to compensation for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> cases and compensation in general. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to item 10, under division 180, the $30.698 million allocated for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> has no entry for 1994-95, although under item 7, compensation and legal expenses, for 1994-95 there is an entry of $62.682 million. My question is: what is the financial coverage for the 25 or so cases which remain outstanding? Are they covered under the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> item or the compensation and legal expenses general heading, or, as I suspect, are they not covered at all? I thought the Attorney-General settled this issue very equitably in this place last May when he made a major comment about the settlement of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> compensation cases. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Commonwealth Government solicitors will enter into negotiations with the rest of the claimants with a view to reaching a settlement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those negotiations do not succeed, the next step will be a process of mediation. We are hopeful, and I think this is a hope shared by the solicitors for the claimants, that that process should see the remaining cases settled . . . It has been a long and difficult case but I do believe now we are at a stage where the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> claims can be reasonably settled to the satisfaction of both sides.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, I ask the minister at the table and perhaps the parliamentary secretary whether that is the case or whether, once again, we are going to have 25 disgruntled, disillusioned <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> claimants in compensation cases who have suffered enough trauma over the last 30 years. Perhaps that question could be taken on board by those opposite. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Defence spending in this year's budget is of major significance to Newcastle, given the decision announced last week by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) regarding the awarding of the minehunter contract to Australian Defence Industries as the preferred tenderer. This represents a billion dollar contract, of which it is expected that some 30 to 40 per cent will be spent in the Newcastle-Hunter region. That in itself is of importance to the local community, but the decision is of much wider importance and is indicative of the last 11 years of development of defence policy and strategy in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the collapse of the Cold War and changes in perceptions and attitudes about preparedness and spending on defence, our government has had to make very hard decisions about priorities and areas of expenditure. The decision by the government at that time to refocus Australian defence as predominantly defensive rather than offensive and, more importantly, to move more and more towards self-reliance is certainly in stark contrast to previous decisions. If we look, for example, at the previous acquisition of FFGs, we see that there is an Australian content of between 30 and 35 per cent whereas, with the new coastal minehunters, we are talking about 67 to 68 per cent Australian content. That was even higher for the Anzac vessels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Important aspects of Australian industry involvement are, firstly, the effect on the economy but, even more importantly, the effect on our sovereignty through self-reliance. The fact is that we are now making major items of defence materiel. I was therefore a bit angry yesterday in question time at the remarks made by one person opposite regarding the software development and platform for the submarine contract. We do not doubt that what is being put forward and what is being developed in Australia is a world first and of world-class magnitude. The software for control, navigation and weapon integration of the Collins class is as complex and sophisticated as any submarine in the world, and it is a totally Australian product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That challenge has been enormous. It is one which we all undertook with quite clear minds. The alternative was to do what previous governments had done: to import the technology from elsewhere. For example, with the F111s we did not have the right to affect any of their internal software configuration. That software was still the property of America and it maintained the rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the Collins class, if we are going to be sovereign, as was the intention, we must develop that software and those systems ourselves. So it is not just bad form; it is bad policy and bad taste for those opposite to blackguard the personnel involved in the way they did during question time yesterday. The companies and naval personnel involved are undertaking what would normally be done by much larger countries than ours. I am extremely angry on behalf of all those people who are working so hard to achieve that world first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at the shift in focus that the defence industry is now giving Australia in the potential for exports or&mdash;perhaps I should go further&mdash;a lack of imports. In 1983, we had some very good Leopard tanks made in Germany. The tragedy was that we could not make the shells in Australia. We would have had to rely on an overseas supplier to provide us with munitions for those tanks if we went to war. We have had to change that kind of attitude. Yesterday's question regarding the submarine was appalling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In conclusion, I think this minehunter decision is a major one. It is of enormous strategic importance both in defence terms&mdash;such as protecting our sea lanes&mdash;and in the development of Newcastle and New South Wales. I look forward to it being a very successful project and one that will bring credit not just to the companies but to the personnel involved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In continuing my remarks on the Australian Defence Industries, I wish to quote from a letter I received from Mr Darren Ripper, who is the convener of shop stewards at ADI Bendigo:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Late last year, the Macquarie Bank submitted a report to the Federal Government recommending the full privatization and sell off of ADI. ADI unions understand that the Macquarie Bank report acknowledged that the Bendigo engineering plant had achieved a considerable improvement on sales in the last couple of years. The Macquarie Bank report further recognized that in the last 2 years the Bendigo plant had achieved a 15% reduction in aggregate labour costs and that the Bendigo plant "has secured some significant commercial contracts".</PARA>
<PARA>The staff of ADI is to be commended on the achievement of a 15 per cent reduction in aggregate labour costs with improved productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Macquarie Bank's report simply addressed the economics of the plant rather than the defence aspects of it. The Macquarie Bank is noted for its fine work in the economics area. I do not wish to dispute the content of its report in that respect. However, the question of whether it is appropriate for sensitive defence functions to be placed outside the government's control is one which I believe was not properly addressed. The position I have adopted and held for some time prior to the Gulf War&mdash;it was certainly reinforced by the conflict; it strengthened my views&mdash;is that it is important that the government of the day control Australia's defence matters and defence related production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have indicated to the House that Australian Defence Industries has now closed down the Maribyrnong plant on the outskirts of Melbourne and relocated all the heavy engineering to the Australian Defence Industries plant at the city of Bendigo. Its quality of work in heavy engineering and ordnance and armaments manufacture is world class. It has competed in the world scene on a whole range of projects. It is involved with the Anzac frigate work. It is also involved with the submarine project and sources a number of specialised components to the development and manufacture of the submarines. Its work is of 100 per cent quality. I hope the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), who is at the table, is listening because I want him to refer this to the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), and impress upon him that it is time the government made a decision on the future of Australian Defence Industries in Bendigo. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) referred to a question in the House yesterday about the new submarine project. In defence of the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson), I think it was a very reasonable question, simply because the public has a right to know why projects of that magnitude&mdash;we are dealing with over $5 billion of taxpayers' money&mdash;will result in a delay in that first boat, the Collins submarine, of up to 11 months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I direct a question to the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), who is at the table, and, through him, to the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) about the new submarine project.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My question to the minister would be a deeper one in relation to the ongoing technology transfer to Australia and the future viability of the Australian Submarine Corporation. From memory, the Australian Submarine Corporation was looking for follow-on orders by the end of 1995 to make sure that that yard does not degenerate into just another repair yard for submarines. The decision, welcome as it might be by the honourable member for Newcastle and ADI, has not solved a problem for the Australian Submarine Corporation. I know most people will say, `Well, that's competition,' but there are still some question marks about the Australian Submarine Corporation, about its corporate structure and, indeed, about its commitment to the ongoing technology transfer to this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a major issue which has not yet been addressed. I suspect in the coming months it may be addressed in one form or another, but I just say to the Assistant Treasurer at the table that the Australian Submarine Corporation, which is doing a great job at the moment in the construction of those Collins class boats, really needs something to follow on. A number of questions will have to be answered in detail in relation to the systems interface problems that exist in that first boat, hopefully not flowing through to the follow-on boats. Nevertheless, the government will have to address the future of ASC further down the pike, and I suppose it depends on the commercial viability of that corporation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the short time that is left in this debate, I want to place on record the importance of the Australian Survey Regiment to the electorate of Bendigo. The regiment is of major importance to Bendigo's economy as it employs 300 salaried staff who earn approximately $11.7 million per year, and the flow-on effects create an additional 180 jobs in Bendigo, with a net effect of injecting about $4.5 million into the local economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the consideration by the government and the Minister for Defence of the suggested privatisation of the defence survey and mapping work, I wrote to the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, indicating to him the important role that the Australian Survey Regiment played in Bendigo's economic life. It also plays another very important role in that the technology and expertise that a lot of the personnel have developed in the survey regiment is shared amongst a lot of other organisations in Bendigo. Personnel from the Army Survey Regiment play a very important part in community life in Bendigo, contributing to many organisations and activities. Army personnel have often been granted the freedom of the city of Bendigo, and enjoy a very well respected position in the community of Bendigo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I wrote to Senator Robert Ray I asked him to examine the opportunity to expand the regiment's activities rather than reduce them, and there is scope for that to occur. I believe mapping functions which occur in other state jurisdictions could well be serviced by the Army Survey Regiment and this would minimise the cost. The regiment does high-class work that is recognised worldwide, and the opportunity to do mapping for other agencies throughout Australia would create an opportunity for high-class mapping to be introduced to a number of state government departments. Also, there would be the opportunity to train personnel at either the Latrobe University Bendigo campus or the Loddon Campaspe Regional College of TAFE. There are opportunities to develop a high level of technological expertise in the field of mapping and drafting survey work which the Army Survey Regiment in Bendigo is renowned for. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will begin my contribution in the very short time available to me by making the overall point that the problem for primary industry is not in the level of expenditure in the portfolio. In nominal terms that has been flat for 11 or 12 years. In real terms it has undergone a massive decrease, particularly when compared with expenditure in other areas&mdash;even defence, let alone social security and so forth. That in itself is not a major problem or concern to farmers. The real issue at stake in this budget is the overall approach to fiscal management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget spends too much; it taxes too much; and it soaks up too much of the Australian community's scant savings. This loose approach to fiscal policy is likely to drive interest rates up. It will certainly maintain them at levels that they need not be at. As a consequence, the Australian dollar will also be higher than it otherwise would have been or the level considered desirable. Those two factors are bad news for the farm sector, which is still responsible for about one-third of Australia's export income and 450,000-odd jobs and is the basis of our biggest manufacturing sector, food processing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I will refer very briefly to some specifics. Firstly I will deal with AQIS. I recall with some interest that in August last year, shortly after the last budget, the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean), and the then Minister for Resources, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), issued a joint statement headed `1993/94 budget: good news for primary industries', in which they said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"A reduction in Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) costs to industry to assist Australian companies' export efforts by reducing the cost of Canberra office and regional activities . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"AQIS charging regime will be kept at current rates and reduce over the next four years. Industry will benefit by more than $10 million from this initiative with the biggest benefits going to the most efficient operators . . . ."</PARA>
<PARA>Attachment C to that release claimed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"AQIS is already implementing $20 million of staff and administrative reductions as a result of an announcement earlier this year. This is on top of substantial reductions in staff (over 500) during the past three years."</PARA>
<PARA>If we look at the statement that 500 staff have gone over three years to August of last year, we find that, if each of those staff averaged $32,000 in reduced costs, that should have resulted in savings of around $16 million in lower costs to industry. But it did not happen. Unfortunately, there is not much evidence that it will happen in the future. The budget papers show that over recent years the total average cost of AQIS was $171 million or $172 million. This year it will be $183 million. That allows some $13 million for redundancies. If we allow for that, since 1989-90 the cost of running AQIS has been quite static at around $170 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question must be asked: where are the savings? Where is the $10 million promised by the minister? Where are the savings of $16 million from getting rid of staff for whom in many instances there is simply nothing to do? A great deal more effort needs to be put into this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth reminding the House that we have a commitment from the government that there will be a bipartisan approach to a Senate inquiry into AQIS to review the efficacy and the ongoing nature of the reform process in AQIS. That will be kicked off early next year. We are waiting, we are watching and we want real numbers on the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish briefly to mention a couple of other things. I believe that it is counterproductive to cut `exceptional circumstances' for the hard-pressed wool industry just as the industry is catching the first whiff of recovery. Many farmers, who will now perhaps go under, might well have made it and their communities would have benefited accordingly had the exceptional circumstances funding been continued for another year. The criteria for eligibility were too narrow. That has had an unfair impact and the government, even at this late stage, should urgently review the position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I wish in broad terms to mention a couple of things. There is a remaining urgent need in the farming community for the government to tighten fiscal policy, to move to free up industrial relations and to break the boom and bust management of the Australian economy. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I refer to page 79 of the Working Nation document which refers to the expansion of the export market development grants&mdash;the EMDG scheme&mdash;to provide export marketing assistance to single service tourism operators to recognise the significant contribution of the tourism industry to export growth.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the brief time I have available to me in this consideration of the allocations to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, I want to focus on three points which show how primary producers will be adversely affected. The first and most significant point which is of concern to primary producers is that the budget in toto will not keep interest rates low. In fact, I believe that, when the current low inflation rate is taken into account, interest rates are still at historically high levels. Despite the number of reductions that the Treasurer (Mr Willis) brags about&mdash;and there is a concern that interest rates are already too high&mdash;there is an expectation that, because the government cannot manage the economy properly and because there is a concern that inflation might rise again, interest rates could rise again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already seen long-term interest rates rising since last September. An increase in interest rates is of grave concern to all primary producers, all business people and all those who have borrowed money. There was a warning of this increase in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>. Contrary to the nonsense that is spoken by the government, let us consider what one of the leading banks in Australia is predicting. An article on the front page of today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Westpac warned that interest rates could jump by three per cent by the end of next year because of the Federal Government's failure to make greater cuts in the Budget deficit.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very frightening prospect, particularly for farmers who have encountered so many difficulties over the last three or four years. I suggest to the government that the thought of interest rates rising again does not represent an orange warning light; it represents a red flashing light. It is of grave concern. If the government wants to see a sustained recovery, then it ought to take a long, hard look at some of the decisions it has made in this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us consider what this means for primary producers. Every increase of one per cent in interest rates will increase the interest bill of primary producers by over $100 million per year. Clearly, if that Westpac warning becomes reality by the end of next year, primary producers will have to pay out over $300 million extra in interest over and above what they would be currently paying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also some spin-off effects from that. If the government starts to push up interest rates, that is also likely to have some effect on the value of the Australian dollar. If the Australian dollar is to continue to rise, as some people seem to expect at the moment, that too will have a very negative impact on the income of primary producers. So there is very real concern that the whole strategy underpinning this budget will be extremely negative for people in primary production and people living in rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point which is of concern to primary producers is the increase in taxes that the government does not want to talk about&mdash;the increase in fuel excise. Although the Treasurer is trying to tell us he is not increasing taxes, the fact is that the fuel excise will go up by 13 per cent this year, on top of an 18 per cent increase last year. Nothing could have a more negative impact on the cost of doing business and, I would suggest, even on the cost of living in rural and regional Australia than putting up the cost of fuel because the cost of transport affects everything.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is my first chance to participate in these appropriation debates which have been taking place in the House for some time now. It is with pleasure that I enter the debate on the appropriations for the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the Department of Tourism. As a member for a rural electorate, I want to confine my remarks at this stage to the primary industries and energy portfolio. That does not mean that I do not have a great deal of interest in the allocations to tourism: I also represent an area that derives a substantial part of its economy from the tourism industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to the primary industries and energy portfolio allocations, one aspect that I wish to comment on, with my ongoing interest in the economic and social aspects of the environment, is that through the Department of Primary Industries and Energy the government will provide some $1 million in each of the next four years to develop economic and social assessments of regional forests as part of the Commonwealth-state assessments of regional forest agreements. My electorate does not have great areas under forest, but there are some, as well as some forest timber industries. The honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) would obviously have a much greater area under forest in his electorate. I am delighted to lend my support to the assessments of regional forest agreements as they will cover many other areas of Australia&mdash;I must not be too parochial about it&mdash;and will certainly be of interest to people in the southern parts of New South Wales and to the electorate of Cowper, and the states of Tasmania and Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreements are intended to secure access to regional timber resources for industry and to facilitate long-term investment in value adding and regional development. It marries in with the government's overall policy and the thrust of certain policy issues announced in the white paper. It will also provide some secure protection for the high conservation values and assist in the establishment of a comprehensive, adequate and representative network of forest reserves across Australia. For that reason, it will be of benefit to move towards helping preserve biodiversity across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further aspect which I am glad the department is backing is the problem caused by nutrient run-off to Australian waterways. Everyone would be well aware of the recent blue-green algae problem that has beset some of our major rivers. I am delighted that we have been able to lend our support to a study which will look at practical options for using economic instruments to reduce nutrients while minimising the cost to farms and households. It is not about taking a stick to any of the agricultural industries. Many of them already recognise the need to marry up the amount of fertiliser input on farms with what is used or needed for plant and crop growth&mdash;as you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would be well aware. To reduce and match up the level of nutrient input on farms minimises not only the run-off but also the costs if done properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But as well as reaffirming our commitment to the decade of landcare through that $102 million, which will be allocated to the national landcare program to support ecologically sustainable development in rural communities, one aspect that does have an impact in my area, obviously, is LEAP&mdash;the landcare and environment action program. I commend Mr Mark Jackson of Greening Australia Ltd who operates from offices in Lismore. The program that he runs has seen some 250 people placed in jobs and undertake landcare and environment programs on the north coast. They are having a significant impact on the reafforestation of some of the catchment areas, which fits in with what is essentially a state program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total management of the catchment of rivers started some way back, in 1983-84, by the now retired Jack Hallam, who was the minister for agriculture in the New South Wales government at that time. As I mentioned, the program fits in with a number of other areas and is reaping great benefits.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In terms of the allocations for tourism in this particular budget, I draw attention to the fact that most government members have been making reference to the regional tourism grants. The regional tourism grants, while they are welcomed, should not necessarily be the prime focus of the government planning for the future of the Australian tourist industry. I bring to the attention of the government in these few minutes that are available to me today some of the very real shortfalls that are happening at the moment in terms of the provision of tourism planning for the rest of this particular decade. There is a very real requirement for that planning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we pride ourselves on the fact that we have won the Olympic Games in the year 2000 in Sydney, and that is going to be a tremendous boost to Australia, we should never forget that we are sitting, in the Pacific rim, on the verge of one of the greatest tourist booms the world has ever known. I would like to quote for the government and the government planners the figures that have been released by the World Tourism Organisation. The figures indicate that 140 million Asian people will be travelling offshore for their holidays by the year 2000. The reality is that even if Australia could get 10 per cent of that business we could not handle it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really wonder what the government is doing in terms of that planning. It seems absolutely amazing to me. When we look at things like the partial restoration of the export market development grant whereby tourist operators now can get only 25 per cent of what they claim overseas as part of the tourism promotional effort&mdash;or, indeed, when we look at the area of landing rights for international carriers or at the development of the common aviation market across the Tasman&mdash;it would almost appear that this government is coming to a grinding halt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some very real difficulties that we are facing. The first one is the physical capacity to carry passengers in and out of Australia. At a time when the only bilateral negotiations that we have on our books are with Germany&mdash;and Germany is an important market&mdash;we see some complete ignorance of issues that are facing the aviation industry and the tourist industry. Last night in the aviation debate I made reference to the failure of Australia to reach conclusion with New Zealand of the common aviation market arrangements across the Tasman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know if people really realise the tremendous advantages that those arrangements are going to bring to Australia. The fact is we do have an open aviation market and we have, in principle, an agreement with New Zealand to finalise those arrangements. Australia is on the verge of welshing on that agreement because the whole thing was supposed to be in place by November this year. The free travel of international visitors across the Tasman is going to be very important for both countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The traditional saying that people are going to come only to Australia, they want a single destination only, frankly is a load of tripe. It is particularly wrong if we think that that is the attitude of the Asian travellers; they want multi destinations. We have an opportunity to put into place a south-west Pacific destination to make sure that we maximise our efforts out of Asia and to make sure that we do have comparable product with other competitors in the international tourism game. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Asians go to Europe they do not go just to London; they do the grand tour. If they go to the United States they are more than likely to take in places such as Mexico and Canada as well. The reality is that, while we have got lots to offer in Australia, we have an infinitely better product if we can offer them the South Pacific, too. But, no, it would almost seem as though the government is welshing on the deal at the moment to conclude that free aviation deal between Australia and New Zealand. I urge the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) to make sure he goes and belts a few heads within the aviation department to make that happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that has evolved in recent years has been a greater profile for tourism in the determination of Australian air rights, but it would almost seem that we are going to that old situation where the airlines are once again becoming masters of tourism rather than the servants of tourism&mdash;that has got to stop. The other matter I would like to flag is the requirement of the government to start looking at what is going to happen in terms of the provision of accommodation in Australia. Already in places such as Cairns and, to an extent, the Gold Coast, we are seeing shortages of top-line accommodation. Around the Asia-Pacific region at the moment there are something like 400 major hotels under construction. How many have we got in Australia? Three! That is because the taxation system is crazy. It is also because we had troubles in the 1980s in terms of the boom, and troubles in terms of the yield that was gained by the hotels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the reality is that if we are going to take this boom up and service the people in the Olympic Games period, some action has got to be taken now. One thing that we would want to see coming out of the Department of Tourism is the planning of very real means to get investment going again. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been some comments made about the rural adjustment scheme in this consideration of the appropriations of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. I point out to honourable members present in the House that the rural adjustment scheme is continuing. It is a fact that the hardship provisions have been removed from the scheme, but that does not mean to say that farmers and those who have genuine needs are not in a position to be able to go on and receive assistance from the rural adjustment scheme. With the way some comments have been expressed, one would think that the whole business was being withdrawn. In fact, it is only a small section that is no longer determined necessary. The fact that it has been withdrawn does not mean the sky is going to cave in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to address the rural communities access program. Funding from that program will bring direct support for counselling to rural Australians experiencing financial hardship, as well as education and training assistance for community projects and disadvantaged groups across Australia. Overall, the funding will assist the establishment of some 400 new business enterprises and will create some 800 full or part-time jobs. Funding will also support the development of 50 self-sufficient telecentres. Some of these telecentres are already up and running, including the Byron Telecentre at 33 Fletcher Street, Byron Bay. I give that address in case honourable members wish to drop in there on their holidays to look at it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I opened that centre some 12 or 18 months ago. It provides a service to the community in terms of both use and learning. In terms of use, people who are familiar with computers but who do not have the benefit of having one at home can use the computers and the services provided in the telecentre to write out job applications, letters and so forth, and access such facilities as E-mail. It is a tremendous advantage for people in a rural community to be able to access information via E-mail, particularly when people can link into universities and libraries to get information. It almost brings the University of the Southern Cross into everyone's home. The telecentre can be used in computer-aided design as well as simply in learning. The telecentre has been a big success. In other areas or regions across Australia that are fortunate enough to have a telecentre established, I would suggest that people get down there very quickly to have a look at how they operate and see the sorts of services, benefits and facilities that such centres can bring to an area. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to pick up on three issues: first, the extent to which the government has been bereft of policies itself and has had to essentially filch from the opposition most of the substantial changes that it has made over time; secondly, the ad hoc nature of the decisions that the government makes; and, thirdly, the unrealistic expectations that it sometimes creates in people's minds and is essentially unable to realise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal with the stolen policies. The first and most significant one was to raise the pension age for women from 60 to 65. The government said when it adopted that policy that it was doing so because the way in which women are remunerated in the work force had been essentially addressed and we now had genuine equal pay. Is it not interesting that statistics released today demonstrate that the situation of women is deteriorating significantly in comparison with men?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there are other matters: the review of the income and assets test for pensioners; the enhanced compliance testing and review activity for jobsearch&mdash;a matter that is still progressing; the increasing of pharmaceutical benefits for the over 65s&mdash;the government's seniors card essentially adopted that initiative; the increase in the level of the dependent spouse rebate that we promised, which was really implemented through the HCCA arrangements; the increases in family allowances for those on lower incomes, which we promised; the easing of the jobsearch rules for the over 50s, which the government implemented through the mature age allowance, and the increases in child-care rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even in this document, the extent to which the government tightened up on eligibility for benefits in the hands of new arrivals was a matter first flagged by the opposition and later picked up by the government. But I find one issue particularly of interest, and I want to comment on it in terms of the ad hoc nature of the decisions that the government is making. I want to posit this question in people's minds: why are these decisions being made by announcement when we had a budget only three weeks ago?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One issue I wish to raise is that of the new widows allowance. If it involves any extra cost then, of course, one would expect it to have been dealt with in the budget, but it was not. So one assumes that the government has been able to announce it because it involves no extra cost. If it is only a cosmetic change then I do not think the government should be maintaining great credit for itself for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government is trying to put those who are going to receive the widows allowance in the same position as those receiving the widows B pension, one wonders why they were not put back on a widows B pension. I suspect the reason is that there were no additional benefits to be obtained by the people involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also refer to the extent to which the government made the change in relation to returned service people and their conditions of service. It would not go the whole way and admit that it was wrong, so it fiddled with the income testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most disappointing issue of all is that of this government's unrealised expectations. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) went overseas to flag that he was going to save some $500 million for Australians through negotiating a new deal with the New Zealanders. When we look at this budget, we see that he came back with a real fizzer. We now have an indication that the government is going to save something in the order of only $2 million in 1994-95&mdash;the first year of operation of the new changes&mdash;rising to $53 million in 1997-98. The Prime Minister went to New Zealand, chased by his Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin). The briefings that were given to the press before they left held out that $500 million was able to be recouped. I have never seen such a fizzer by any government at any time. The government, the parliamentary secretary and the minister should hold their heads in shame. </PARA>

It is timely to reflect on what we do for our veterans, and I think the House will agree that this week has drawn great attention to our war veterans. Those people, both men and women, who served in wars, from colonial times up to recent times, deserve all the support we can give them. Therefore, I am very pleased to support the measures contained in this year's budget. This budget contains an excellent veterans affairs package.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two of the highlights in this year's budget are the repeal of the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act and the bringing of merchant mariners who served during wartime under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. That is something about which many honourable members have had representations for some time; I certainly have. I was delighted that the lobbying from all of us resulted in that change. We are recognising those people who died or were wounded when serving in that field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The expanded health programs for our veterans, particularly for those who are now elderly, are also extremely important. The widows and widowers of veterans will now receive their pensions and disability allowances from the Department of Veterans' Affairs rather than from the Department of Social Security, and that is something that a lot of veterans were pleased about. Likewise, the widows and widowers of service people will now be paid their pensions at the single rate by the Department of Veterans' Affairs instead of half the married rate. That is also an advance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue that interests me the most is the new support for Vietnam veterans. The Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service has been greatly expanded. The 1989 report of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs, which highlighted this area, has been significant, and that support is ongoing. There is an allocation of $20.6 million over four years to deal with post-traumatic stress disorder&mdash;something which has been identified in a great number of Vietnam veterans. In the past we have been only too willing to look at the physical injuries of veterans, not the emotional injuries. In the First World War we called people cowards if they ran away, when really they were suffering from stress just as much as more modern veterans are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the privilege of seeing a program for post-traumatic stress disorder at St John of God Hospital at Richmond in my electorate. When I spoke to some of the veterans after the first week of a two-week program, they were full of praise for the progress they had made. I have strongly supported&mdash;and drove the last Minister for Veterans' Affairs nearly mad with my support&mdash;the continuation of that program. It was looking a bit dicey for a while, but I think it is now back on the road. The program for post-traumatic stress disorder resulted from what is now known as the Sainsbury report which was a study into the psychological needs of Vietnam veterans. I am glad that those programs will now be strongly supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the privilege a couple of Saturdays ago of attending, at Lawson in my electorate, the unveiling of a plaque for Vietnam veterans. The unveiling was done by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), who is himself a Vietnam veteran. It was a most enjoyable bipartisan day. The plaque was to commemorate Vietnam veterans but, in particular, two veterans from Lawson who died during that war: Private Ron Field and Corporal Robert Bowtell. Both young men had lived in Lawson, in that mountain community, all their lives. They went to war and suffered the ultimate penalty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also had the privilege of having lunch with Mrs Diane Field, the widow of Ron Field. She told me&mdash;and it really struck a chord&mdash;that she was married at 17 and widowed at 18, a tragedy that I hope is not repeated. But Diane Field, being part of the earlier problem, is now part of the solution: she is part of a group which is offering a Vietnam veterans counselling service in the Blue Mountains which started only a few weeks ago. It is part of the program which has been part of this budget. So I am very pleased to endorse the Veterans' Affairs budget for 1994-95. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my privilege in this debate today to follow my friend the honourable member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm). On Monday of last week, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) asked the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) a simple question: why, despite the Labor Party's rhetoric, are the poor in Australia getting poorer and the rich getting richer? The Australian Bureau of Statistics published results last week showing that, since 1983, the richest 10 per cent of Australia's population have seen their incomes rise by seven per cent, whereas the bottom 10 per cent have seen their incomes fall by five per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that Australia needs significant structural reform, we know what this reform and readjustment will cause, we know that social patterns are changing, and we know also that our population is ageing. For all these reasons, we need an effective and strong social security system. No thoughtful person can reasonably accept that the free market, fundamentalist approach to employment and social welfare can work in a contemporary society. We need a social security system that takes account of what is happening in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This does not just mean that we should accept the status quo; it means the opposite. If we are to meet the challenges that will arise as our economy and society changes, we need a social security system that is effective, efficient, well targeted and flexible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In their budget responses, ACOSS and the Council for the Ageing both spoke of the failure of the government to meet the needs of our rapidly ageing population. I cannot think of a more fundamental welfare issue that the government needs to tackle. I will not reach retirement age for almost another 40 years, but that does not mean that my generation will be able to solve the problems that this period will raise for the future. Australia urgently needs a more imaginative and better quality contribution to the debate on future directions for social security than this budget provides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite recently, many newspapers reported on the growing welfare dependency in Australian society. It is genuinely alarming to see how some groups, like the long-term unemployed, are trapped by the welfare system. At the same time, we should realise that an ageing population and work force will result in increases in the number of people on age pensions and needing disability pensions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should stop the growth of welfare myths. I discovered that figures showed that only four per cent of sole parent pensioners are aged under 20. We should stop the talkback staple of girls getting pregnant in order to get the pension. We need to look at the fundamentals of the social welfare system. We need a welfare system which cares for the genuinely needy and disadvantaged; we need to ensure that the increasing numbers of aged and retired people are adequately provided for within budgetary restraints; and we need to eliminate poverty traps and prevent the emergence of an underclass. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of our key welfare aims must be to support the family. We need effective family support payments and benefits that will tackle the effect on families of the changes that have occurred over the past 20 years in how we work and live. We know the problems of crime, poor health, homelessness and drug and alcohol abuse that family breakdown can cause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We should also recognise the basic values of trust, respect, tolerance, reliability, honesty, mutual respect and a genuine feeling for the needs of others that we can learn from families and make sure that we do everything we can to support them. We need state welfare but we must make sure that it does not commodify assistance, that it does not generate an impersonal mass society that fails to meet any needs other than basic material demands. The best social assistance is assistance that can be provided on a more human scale, that can take account of individual circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are already seeing some genuine trends towards private involvement in our social security system. These are to be welcomed, but we must make sure that demands on welfare agencies are reflected in government spending. Egalitarianism is still an important concept to Australians. We must work to keep it that way. Rather than trumpeting recoveries that only benefit a wealthy few, we can make the structural changes needed to produce a society where everyone has more. We can make sure that we have a social security system that can support the needy and, wherever possible, help them reintegrate into the mainstream of economic life. But to do so we need much more than is contained in this budget. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to support the outlays and the way in which this government has produced a well-targeted welfare system in Australia over the past 11 years. To quote some of the figures and outcomes since 1983: payments for low income families with children under 13 have increased in real terms by 74 per cent and by 147 per cent for teenagers; payments to sole parents with between one and four children have increased by 22 per cent in real terms; the basic pension rate has increased in real terms by 14 per cent; and rent assistance has increased by between 81 and 141 per cent depending on the target group.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A study in 1991 showed how well targeted the Australian social security system is compared with other OECD nations. There was an analysis of how effectively each welfare dollar is delivered in 10 OECD nations. Australia came out on top with a coefficient of 41.3 per cent, followed by the USA with 33.5 per cent, Canada with 30.1 per cent&mdash;and the list goes on until we reach the most poorly targeted nation, Sweden, with a coefficient of 17.3 per cent. This government has achieved a huge amount in guaranteeing the Australian public a well-targeted, effective, means tested social security system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has been very interested in recent times to work out what the opposition policy will be post-Fightback. The only proposal has come from the opposition's newest member, the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), who in his first speech set out a new family payment and child endowment scheme which was repeated in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> last Friday. I was caught by surprise, I must confess, by the sheer dimension of his social security plan. I fully expected in his first speech all the cringing, crawling attitudes about the constitutional monarchy, totally out of step with the values and views of our generation. I also expected some fiscal responsibility in such an important speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have all heard from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) and the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), about how the outlays in this budget and the budget deficit, reflecting their fetish with deficits, should have been substantially lower. But the honourable member for Warringah&mdash;his proposal is the only proposal that the Liberal Party has put forward on social security&mdash;has produced the most expensive, unfunded first speech in the history of the parliament. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budgetary cost of introducing a family wage of $100 a week for the first child and $30 a week for every further child would be about $7.5 billion a year&mdash;$14 billion to pay the family wage less the $6.5 billion cost of the existing family allowance . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It is extraordinary that the Liberal Party's only social security proposal post-Fightback is an unfunded, untargeted, non-means tested allocation of $7.5 billion. This is absolutely extraordinary. Where is the equity in this? The article points out the benefits for various family groups. For a family on an annual income of $15,000 and with three children, the scheme would produce an increase of $1,841. For a family on $40,000 a year and with three children, the increase would be much closer to $7,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no concept of social equity in the social security proposals of the Liberal Party in the 1990s&mdash;the greater the income the greater the benefit. In the article the honourable member for Warringah goes on to point out that the Liberal Party should not proceed with income splitting as proposed by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with income splitting, at least in its most simple form between husband and wife, is that it helps high-income earners more than low-income earners.</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what the honourable member for Warringah would do in his scheme. Overwhelmingly, higher benefits go to higher income earners and lower benefits go to lower income earners. There is no equity and no consistency in the Liberal Party's welfare proposals post-Fightback. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party knows little about finesse and subtlety in policy making; it always goes in with the sledgehammer. The 15 per cent GST sledgehammer was knocked out at the last election, so the next sledgehammer is an unfunded commitment to welfare of $7.5 billion. I am sure this proposal will be supported by the honourable member for Warringah's colleague the shadow minister, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), who nods in agreement. This is an untargeted and non-means tested sledgehammer in the welfare area. The Liberal Party has no interest in equity, proper values and compassion. This is simply hopeless, untargeted policy formulation in the social security area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a tragedy that we have only five minutes to refer to the social security estimates, which is the biggest item in the budget. The amount being spent is almost equivalent to the amount of personal income tax receipts, yet we are allowed a short time to debate the many complex issues involved. Over recent times the number of Australians dependent upon social security has increased enormously. Around 9 1/2 million Australians benefit in some way from our national welfare system. The fact that only 7.75 million Australians are in full- or part-time work demonstrates the enormity of our social security budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It costs the equivalent of more than a whole new Parliament House every year just to administer the social security department before we get around to writing out the first cheque. The growth in social security has also been enormous. The number of people getting unemployment benefits has increased from 13,212 in 1970 to 911,300 in 1993. The number of people getting sickness benefits has increased fivefold, the number getting invalid pensions has increased fourfold, the number getting special benefits has increased sixfold, the number of age pensioners has doubled and the number of people getting supporting parents benefits increased tenfold. There has been enormous growth in the number of Australians receiving social security benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, such a system is obviously unsustainable in the long term. Our population is ageing, the number of people who are eligible for benefits continues to increase and the drain on the fiscal resources of the nation is stretched further and further. One of startling aspects of budgets over recent times has been the massive decline in the amount of funding provided for capital works. Whereas in the past capital works funding was the biggest item in the budget and social security one of the lesser items, now social security is the big spender and there is little in the budget at all for capital works programs. We prefer to pay unemployment benefits than to have people working in productive jobs. That seems to me to be a very strange list of priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a score of minor matters that are of importance to individuals that I would like to have raised in consideration of the social security estimates. Time allows me the opportunity to raise only one&mdash;the bank accounts that pensioners and welfare recipients are required to have to receive their social security cheques. I think it is wise that social security benefits are paid into bank accounts but obviously a difficulty arises now that banks are increasing their charges, particularly on accounts with very small balances. I am sure all members have received complaints from constituents about bank charges on the accounts that pensioners must have to receive their social security benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November 1991, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration reported on its inquiry into the banking industry and at that time recommended that the retail banks and the Department of Social Security jointly investigate the feasibility of developing a basic banking product to be offered by the retail banks. It was recommended that such a product should allow for a set number of free withdrawals each week and should be targeted to the needs of low income Australians. This kind of a banking product would have been very helpful to pensioners. That was the intention of the banking inquiry when it was recommended. Sadly, the government has done nothing about this recommendation. It has put in place a proposed code of banking practice, but that really fails to address this particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there needs to be some imaginative and creative thinking about the ways in which banks can provide these sorts of accounts as a service for their customers even though they have only small balances. One possible way of achieving this objective would be for the government to perhaps pay the pension cheques into those accounts a day early so that the banks get revenue a day before the pensioners are able to access the benefits in their particular account. That would enable the banks to be able to fund any costs associated with keeping these accounts. There may well be other ways. We cannot really expect the banks to provide a service for no cost and I think the government ought to recognise the obligation it places upon every social security recipient to fund a bank account in order to receive their benefits and to find a way that this can be done at little or no cost to welfare recipients. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As with the earlier consideration in detail debate on the defence budget, which I spoke in, this current consideration of the veterans affairs aspect of the 1994-95 budget is timely given the commemoration of the part played by veterans in many countries in the D-day landings. It is because of their sacrifice and dedication that we now enjoy the lifestyles we do today. Accordingly, it gives me great pleasure to be able to support the 1994-95 budget allocations for Veterans' Affairs here today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initiatives contained in the budget have been developed to address the most pressing needs of ex-service men and women, war widows and widowers and their dependents. The package responds to a range of issues raised by the Baume committee and other groups with respect to problems of older veterans of the world wars and the specific problems of younger veterans of more recent conflicts. I am particularly pleased about the new program designed to provide assistance specifically to Vietnam veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The $20.6 million four-year package directed to serious problems faced by Vietnam veterans is a welcome initiative. The cornerstone of this package is the assistance it will provide for the sufferers of post traumatic stress disorder. Anyone who has had dealings with sufferers of this condition knows how demoralising it is and can be for both the sufferers and their families. Veterans, families and carers will benefit from the package which includes funding for PTSD treatment centres, more resources for the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service as well as money for research into the specific health problems and needs of younger veterans. This package will no doubt bring about an improvement in the quality of life of younger veterans by stressing better health and employment opportunities and improving access to treatment, counselling, rehabilitation and support services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another significant research project that will be funded by the initiatives in the budget is the Vietnam veterans mortality study, which it is hoped will be able to establish the major causes of early death and nature of the links between PTSD and veterans' death rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other major issues in the budget. There is the establishment of a national centre for war related PTSD to develop best practice standards for the management of social, psychological and medical problems associated with PTSD. They are all very important aspects of this legislation. There is also improved coordination of in-patient, outpatient and support services so the veterans with PTSD can be assessed, treated and rehabilitated. The expansion of the Department of Veterans' Affairs joint committee's scheme to encourage self-help projects by the ex-service community to address social and personal problems experienced by young veterans and their families is also welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, as the world reflects on the turning point of World War II that was D-day and looks forward to the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, it is proper that we consider the budget's allocation of funds for the Australian War Memorial. This most sacred of places will receive an additional $8 million over four years for maintenance and restoration work. Another $2.5 million will be provided for the development of its Pacific War Gallery and also focusing on the local conflict. There will be $1.5 million provided for a joint Kokoda memorial project to be constructed by the Australian and Papua New Guinea governments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This form of estimates is a new experience in that the opportunity to ask ministers questions and to get answers on expenditure does not occur in this chamber as it does in the other place. Nonetheless, as the guillotine has been applied and as there is only a short time available, there are a few salient points that I would like to put on the record. First of all, I read again with interest the tabling speech of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) for the appropriation bills. I read with interest the part relating to health, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In aggregate this Budget allocates almost one billion dollars over four years for new and expanded health programs&mdash;without increasing the Medicare levy.</PARA>
<PARA>One could be forgiven for thinking that that is nothing but a description of a magic pudding solution. The fact is that the amount of money available for health care continues to shrink. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the figures that I have placed on the record during the last week show, the private health insurance sector provides more money for health care in Australia than does the Medicare levy. So that we are familiar with those figures, the figure from the private health insurance sector is $3.6 billion, while the Medicare levy provides only $2.4 billion. Yet the figures published in the last year show that 500,000 Australians have opted out of private health insurance. When any Australian opts out of private health insurance, not only does that person lose the freedom of choice but also there is less money in the pool for everybody to share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put it another way, in statistical terms, for every one per cent of people who drop out of private health insurance, $100 million per year is added to the public health bill. Quite clearly, the reason that people drop out of private health insurance is the government's ideologically driven health policy. If ever there was an area of policy determined by the philosophy that the party in government follows it is the area of health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the determined policy of this government to force people out of private health care and to see them dependent on the state&mdash;and, boy, has it succeeded! The problem is that what we get when the pool is smaller and there is not enough money for everyone to have access to the system when needed is a rationing of the service, and that translates into hospital queues. Again and again we see reports and we hear complaints about the length of the queues of people wanting to get into hospital for elective surgery. The problem is that some of them never make it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government boasts in the budget, `Without ever increasing the Medicare levy, we will provide almost $1 billion more over four years for new and expanded health programs.' The bottom line is that ordinary Australians will get less and less access to the health care system when they need it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Statistically, all of us will use the health care system most in the last year of our life. But, personally, I am not prepared to pick which will be the last year of my life, and nor is anybody else. Accordingly, we want access to that system when we need it. The only way we will get it is to have policies of the carrot variety and not of the stick, to encourage people into private health insurance and not force them out. For that reason, the deliberate government policy of preventing any form of gap insurance is opposed by us. It is our policy direction to have gap insurance and to look at relief for premiums paid. I say very firmly that bulk-billing stays. </PARA>

We look forward to the opposition coming forward with a distinct health policy that can be part of a continuing debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In Working Nation, the white paper on employment, there is a chapter on regional development which has perhaps gone a little unheralded in the discussions that have occurred since the paper was brought down. It is important that we look at the way that the Australian economy is developing. We should not be confused that there are overall solutions to every region's problems. As the budget documents indicate, it is correct that the Commonwealth cannot mandate solutions in a uniform way. We really need to look for effort from local communities which shows that they are able to adjust to the problems that they confront and maximise the opportunities that are presented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> One of the real difficulties in any debate about regional development is the definitional problem of what is a region. Nowhere better can this confusion be seen than in the larger cities of Australia, where, because there are no distinct geographical relations and some of the economic and employment relations are a little obscure, it is more difficult to define those regions. We need to look at this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a little envious of regions that are clearly identified. An example of a region that was the recipient of some money through the budget is the Goulburn Valley. Members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts visited Shepparton earlier this year to have discussions with not only the local water board but other regional bodies, such as the regional development board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One very interesting thing that is of great advantage to the Goulburn Valley is that the geography, such as the watersheds of the river systems, the economic relations of the region and, to a certain extent, local government boundaries provide a distinct region that matches up on all those levels. The region has taken advantage of this fact and its residents have been able to get together and develop a distinct plan of action for what they will do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I am sorry that the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) is not in the chamber. I did have a line about his being, most distinctly as a Victorian National, a true agrarian socialist. I will never forget this inspection. We were on the bus in the last five minutes of our visit to Shepparton. The man from the regional development board had our ear. There was no escaping him; we wanted to get to the airport. He said that one need of the region was the provision of infrastructure. A lot of businesses that have been starting to develop on the outskirts of the townships there have difficulties because of the lack of proper telecommunications and electricity infrastructure. It was one of those occasions when good rural dwellers could at least come to government, suggest that they had problems and say that they felt the federal government might be able to assist by putting its hands in the bickie bin and producing some dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all seriousness, I am pleased that Goulburn Valley has a regional plan for a major environmental problem in that area. The federal government saw fit to put money towards alleviating the great salinity problem. It is important that that region, which is a major food producer, has the proper environment. Relating that to the remarks about regions throughout Australia, such as the region that I represent, there is a need to look at infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Standing Committee on Long Term Strategies, in its inquiry into the urban areas of Australia, said that there was an urgent need for an audit of infrastructure so that we had a clear idea of what were the deficiencies and who should be looking at them. I believe the Commonwealth government has a continuing role to play in the provision of all forms of infrastructure, whether it be in directly supplying that infrastructure or in putting into place mechanisms that can assist and motivate private provision of infrastructure. At the end of the day, for the sake of the Australian economy, the Commonwealth government needs to make sure that it is leading the debate in this area. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regions like Cairns and Broome&mdash;which are experiencing impressive growth&mdash;have developed strong models of regional leadership and are pursuing a strategic vision. The story of their success can be shared with other regions.</PARA>
<PARA>To imply that the north-west of Melbourne, for example, is in economic crisis because it lacks regional leadership or vision ignores the fact that global trade and our inability to control the practices of transnational companies have devastated regional communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One cannot help noticing also that every case study identified in Working Nation is from a rural region. This reveals two things. The honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) has referred to this question. Firstly, it is conceptually less difficult to identify solutions for more homogenous rural regions than it is for diverse urban regions. Secondly, it is these urban regions which have been less able to survive in the restructured economy. Rather than acknowledge that global trade has had profound effects on manufacturing in local communities, the paper appears to blame these communities for their problems. This is why the parliament rings with calls for international competitiveness and more flexible labour markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the white paper provides some linking of training with actual job demand, none of these revamped training schemes can answer the needs of depressed regions&mdash;the declining regions where there are no jobs. How can training schemes be matched with non-existent demands for labour? A mass of partly skilled part-time workers is not the dynamic social democracy promised by the paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The funding proposals are totally inadequate. The allocation of $70 million of seeding funds over four years is a pathetic response to the mass unemployment that exists in some depressed regions. It amounts to $3 million less than what will be spent on the development of Badgerys Creek airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In parts of my electorate, unemployment is as high as 20 per cent. In parts of Batman, the electorate of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe), the rate is about the same. The same can be said about the electorates of Melbourne and Calwell. These regions need a lot more than what is offered in the white paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we are at a time when private investment is pitifully low, despite the fact that profits are at a record high, and when income is increasingly being shifted from the bottom to the top segments of our society, and the government tells us that we must run around our electorates spruiking for funds. The coalition, for its part, continues with the approach that has seen it lose three consecutive elections. The honourable member for Mackellar tells us that the government is spending too much money, despite the fact that member after member in this House has stood to praise the concept of regional development. Members of the National Party, our agrarian socialists, are always happy to see some government money channelled into their electorates, but their acquiescence enables the government to get away with spending a pitiful amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Kelty report at least acknowledges that growth has to be created within the regions. The means adopted, however, are a problem. In the electorate of Wills we have talked about shop-top developments, cultural tourism, the importance of the Upfield railway line, the need for more public housing and the efficacy of drawing on the knowledge that comes from having a very diverse population. These issues need to be taken up and funded. </PARA>

Nevertheless, the government has been able to maintain its commitment to social justice in a very direct way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to health policy, it is very important that we have sustained our commitment to Medicare. We are looking at ways and means of reforming the private health insurance system. I was interested in the comments made earlier by the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop). She came into this House and made a very pitiful contribution to the debate by bringing in her usual ideological claptrap from the New Right. She talked about our health policy being totally ideologically driven. What nonsense! The fact of the matter is that the Australian Medicare system has been overwhelmingly endorsed over and over again by the Australian people. It is about time the conservative parties in this country did what other conservative parties in other Western countries have done: accept the fact that we need a reasonable universal health system. It is about time the conservative parties accepted that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Towards the end of her contribution, the honourable member for Mackellar made the point that those opposite are finally coming around to accepting universal bulk-billing. This is after four elections. Medicare has been here for 10 or 11 years, and those opposite are finally coming around to accepting universal bulk-billing, which is one of the planks of Medicare. We welcome that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Mackellar went on to talk about the very difficult problem of private health insurance. We had a joint caucus-ACTU working group that looked at this problem in very comprehensive terms. It looked at the facts and figures. I can tell honourable members that the analysis given by the honourable member for Mackellar does not even begin to come to grips with the issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the honourable member tried to say that there was some interconnection between hospital queues and the current lack of a gap payment with private health insurance. That is the most simple-minded thing she could possibly say. Of course there are problems, but they do not relate to the gap. If we simply put in insurance for the gap, we would allow the total private health bill to grow without the services growing. The doctors would be able to charge whatever they liked in private hospitals. The key issue is: how do we contain the costs of private health through some reasonable insurance system? The contribution of the honourable member for Mackellar simply gave us no answers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition members seem to think that the only thing to do is come in with gap insurance. If they do that they will simply be giving a big prize to the doctors&mdash;and especially the specialists, some of whom earn more than $1 million a year. They are saying that those doctors can continue to charge as much as they like. If opposition members think that costs in the private system do not relate to the costs in the public system, they are wrong. If the costs in the private system go up pressure is put on the public system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the honourable member for Mackellar has got the argument completely the wrong way around. If we want to do something about private health insurance we should study the proposals being put forward by a number of academics, the joint caucus-ACTU working group and other people and work out a solution that involves some capping of the fees that doctors receive in private hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless opposition members do something on this question, they will not have taken the issue seriously. Until we hear the opposition's ideas in relation to this matter, instead of this ideological nonsense, we will not have a proper health debate in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this the Year of the Family it is timely to speak of a budget initiative which has a direct effect on the entire family. I refer to breast cancer. Breast cancer is a condition that kills six Australian women every day. If an Australian woman were unfortunate enough to contract the condition, she would have a 40 per cent of not fulfilling her life because the mortality rate has not changed for almost 50 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a growing community awareness of the urgent need for research funding into breast cancer. Over the last 10 years, approximately 80 speeches have been made on the issue in parliament. Recently some 100,000 Australians signed petitions and presented them to the parliament seeking that the government invest more money in breast cancer research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last October, on behalf of representations made to me by some of the women in Cowan, I introduced a motion to the parliament seeking an increase in breast cancer funding. This followed my earlier speech in August which identified problems with the original ongoing national mammography program. The motion, I recall, was supported by government members. It was pleasing to see the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) take up the issue when she entered parliament. She has had an ongoing interest in this particular area, being a member of the Hancock Family Breast Cancer Research Foundation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was goodwill on both sides of the House in trying to get a fair increase in funding for this vital health issue. The experts in this field must have been encouraged by the lifting of the public debate.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all came to realise how close this condition can be to all of us when our well-respected colleague Senator Jocelyn Newman announced recently she was suffering with breast cancer and required surgery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of breast cancer will not go away whilst it continues to kill six Australian women every day. We in this place should not rest in seeking solutions for the funding shortfall that currently besets breast cancer research. We should always remember the importance of vital women's health issues to the community because women are the core of families which in turn are the very basis of our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With all this demand for increased funding from the community, medical scientists and politicians, let us now look at the response to these demands by the government. The good news is that the budget did address this very important issue. The minister has to be commended for this. But&mdash;and I must say it is a very big but&mdash;it seems the grandiose claims of the major new proposals for breast cancer are nothing but cruel hoaxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A close analysis of the budget reveals that the $237 million committed to national breast cancer screening over five years is simply money to continue a current program. Many members in this place do not seem to realise that if a woman is screened she requires screening again in two years time. So the money really is only contributing to the ongoing machinations of this particular program. The only other new proposal is $1 million a year for a breast cancer foundation providing the public contributes another $1 million, and $2.5 million going to a breast cancer clinic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems a cynical attempt to politicise the issue by allowing the Prime Minister's spouse to head a clinic which as yet has no plan of action. We must never forget that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) publicly stated that it was Mrs Keating alone pushing this issue in the public arena. He conveniently ignored the thousands of Australians that signed petitions and the work of many fine members in this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been no attempt to increase specifically breast cancer research funding, and this issue which is of national importance has been ignored once again by this so-called women friendly government, which it clearly is not.

But we got very little in this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me reinforce to the House that my work in this issue will not cease until we have an adequate increase in breast cancer funding, and I encourage those opposite who feel strongly enough about this issue to lobby their minister for some real action. The myth about this sharing and caring government continues, yet every woman in Australia should be disappointed in the continued neglect of this issue by this government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), I will address my remarks to women's health. I am pleased that this government has focused on women's health. In 1989 it instituted the national women's health program and, in last year's budget, this was financed for a further four years. This program looks at all aspects of women's health, including their sexuality, breast cancer and cervical cancer, post-menopausal problems, including bone density testing, violence to women and many other community health issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year's focus has been on the issue of breast cancer, as the honourable member for Cowan has mentioned. I hope, though, that I will get my facts more correct than he has. The program this year, as has already been said, will focus on three main areas, and the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) focused on these in her answer to a question yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of these areas is the $236.6 million to be provided over the next five years to continue and expand the screening program. The honourable member for Cowan said it was to continue only what was happening. It is not; it is to expand the program. If he looks around his electorate and those of most other honourable members, he will see those mobile screening units bobbing up everywhere. So expansion of the program is extremely important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next step is to focus on treatment. Once detection is carried out, we then need to look at treatment. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs is currently carrying out an inquiry into the treatment and management of women with breast cancer. That is a very gruelling inquiry and we are finding out that a lot of things need to be rectified. Much of that will be addressed in looking towards putting a national focus on treatment by the establishment of a national breast cancer centre. This centre will be set up under the auspices of the National Health and Medical Research Council, which will analyse home and overseas research, will provide a great deal of information and will put the focus on national best practice in the treatment and management of this very severe disease from which many women suffer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third issue is the establishment of a breast cancer foundation, which the honourable member for Cowan again seems to have confused with the centre. He talks about the wife of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) being a sponsor of a clinic. It is not a clinic; it is a foundation. The government is supporting this foundation with $3 million over three years, matched with funds raised from other sources. There is a great emphasis out there in the private sector to support this. Research is definitely being addressed. Of course, we can always use more money for research, but I think this is a great step forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has also increased research funds to the National Health and Medical Research Council by a further $95 million this year and has asked the National Health and Medical Research Council to focus on breast cancer research in its distribution of funds for this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national program for detection has been highly successful. The standing committee will be seeking to focus in its hearings on a national treatment and management program. This is an extremely important area that concerns all women.

Approvals for new residential buildings over the last 12 months total 170,000; the value of housing finance commitments in March was 35 per cent higher than a year earlier; and housing affordability with low interest rates&mdash;the lowest interest rates since the 1970s&mdash;is at its highest level since December 1984.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What the Prime Minister was referring to in his remarks was the fact that we have a very high level of profitability at present. That obviously is a great boost for business in its capacity to invest. The fact that it can invest retained earnings in a way in which it probably has not been able to do at almost any other time in our economic history obviously gives business a great capacity to invest regardless of the level of interest rates. Nevertheless, interest rates in the longer term obviously will have some impact. If interest rates were to rise substantially, which will not happen, but if they were to rise substantially then that would have some adverse impact on investment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. The government intends to continue to pursue its deficit reduction strategy. I remind honourable members that that deficit reduction strategy will see the deficit fall to below one per cent of GDP by 1996-97 and under half a per cent of GDP by the next year. As I have had occasion to remark before in the House, that is a better performance by a country mile on deficit reduction than virtually any other country in the OECD with which we like to compare ourselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said before, the Canadians, who have a much praised deficit reduction strategy in place, are intending by that year, in which we fall under one per cent, to be at around three per cent of GDP. The government has no cause to change its mind in that regard. We are being urged, however&mdash;to pick up one or two other elements of the question that the honourable member asked&mdash;by the opposition to reduce that deficit target somewhat further. The opposition spokesman on Treasury matters said that today's release of Westpac's study indicates that the budget deficit is too high.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of points that ought to be made about that comment because it is yet another example of the right hand of the opposition not knowing what its left hand is doing&mdash;or the right hand of the opposition not knowing what its even further right hand is doing, their not having facing palms. The point that ought to be made at the outset is that the deficit, whatever it is now, is at that level courtesy of the opposition; it is $600 million higher than it would have been had the government's position announced in the previous budget been put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that, while the shadow Treasurer is making his points on deficit reduction other frontbenchers are making their points. We have had mentioned in this place before what the opposition spokesman on foreign affairs thinks the size of the aid budget ought to be. The honourable member for Maranoa has stated that we need to set a figure of between $1 billion and $3 billion for infrastructure spending&mdash;that is an unrepudiated commitment that he has put forward. We have had statements on Aboriginal health, and we had a couple of classic statements over the weekend that dwarf even those previous statements in terms of their implications for the budget. As with just about everything it seems these days, these statements came from the honourable member for Mackellar. She has said both on radio and in her column that it is time we advocated tax relief for health insurance premiums. If it were tax relief at the level of Fightback, it would be $1.5 billion; if it were tax relief at full credit, it would be $3 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Mackellar is also talking about introducing some form of coverage for gap insurance&mdash;some sort of tax incentive. That would add hundreds of millions of dollars to the opposition's expenditure totals. So we are totting up a pretty formidable list of unrepudiated statements out there about what those opposite intend to do with the budget deficit. From my recollection of the figures that I have just produced, those opposite would add anywhere between $3 billion and $6 billion to the $600 million that they, through their own personal efforts, have already managed to add to the budget deficit during this year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a peculiarly mercantilist kind of approach to economics, which I guess indicates a rather naive approach to economics by the National Party. It is not surprising that it was the National Party that was intent on maintaining a high tariff wall around Australia to the great disadvantage of the people whom it represents. In the deregulated financial system that we have at the present time it is clear that there is no restriction on Australians lending overseas. In those circumstances, Australians can invest in other countries and this, in a mature economy, is what we would want to see.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To make the decision about whether to invest, people look at the circumstances in this country and elsewhere and decide where it is most appropriate to put their money. There are essentially no restrictions on their doing that. It is obviously, in those circumstances, important that the nation, having deregulated its financial system, produces an environment in this country conducive to increased investment. That is exactly what this government has done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation now where there are just tremendous circumstances for investment. The fact that investment has not occurred in the last few years is related to the recession and its aftermath, the fact that companies have been repairing their balance sheets, that they had excess capacity to work off before they needed to invest. Most importantly, they have been able to increase their productivity so they can use their existing capacity more productively. That is a very good thing for the nation and it means that we do not have to invest more in order to produce more. That means that people can put off the point at which additional investment is needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite all that happening, capacity utilisation rates are moving up and we can expect that business will have to move into that investment phase shortly. That is what the BCA survey is all about. If those opposite read the BCA survey, which tells what it expects its members are going to do, they will see that it says there is going to be a big increase in investment because the conditions that have been holding investment back in the past are in the past and the future is one in which it sees substantial investment occurring, particularly with high profitability, low interest rates, increased international competitiveness and very substantial tax inducements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The environment for investment in this country is as good now as it has ever been, particularly in the context, with all of that, of high levels of demand.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry that the Leader of the Opposition is not interested in the welfare of the members of our armed forces and their families; but I will continue. There were anomalies in how these new arrangements were relating to defence force members and their families. The method used by the Department of Social Security and by DEET to assess notional rent with variations between metropolitan, non-metropolitan and what they call special areas unfortunately led to inequitable results when applied to our defence forces. In some cases, defence force personnel of the same rank at the same base in similar sorts of housing with similar numbers of children could, by mere accident&mdash;they have no choice about where they live&mdash;be receiving up to $122 less per fortnight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Holsworthy base, which I visited recently, was one such example. This is against the background that our defence families have no choice about where they live. Because of this, quite some time ago Defence Force rents were standardised across Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am now pleased to inform the honourable member for Fowler and other members of the House that a more equitable solution has been found. This entails assessing the notional rent for all defence families at the lowest special rate. This acknowledges that defence families all pay the same rent no matter where they live, depending on rank. It also recognises the unique mobility requirements and the lifestyle that we as Australians expect of our defence personnel. My latest advice indicates that virtually no defence families will be adversely affected and that their additional family benefit and eligibility for DEET payments will therefore now be affected only by family income, which of course can vary.</PARA>

They were asked by the ACTU, and they went along with the ACTU because they, like the ACTU, have been grievously embarrassed by the fact that the independent international agency has been issuing, time and again, unfavourable comment on the accord which, as we all know, is the centrepiece of the government's program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me remind the House that the accord was an agreement that was reached between the Australian Labor Party and the trade union movement in 1983. Since that time, every policy that the government has brought down has had to have the approval of the ACTU. That includes employment policies, education policies and training policies. The social crisis which this country is now facing is a direct consequence of the fact that this government has become a highly sectional government&mdash;not a government on behalf of all Australians, but a government for a part of Australia, a government which acts at the behest of the officials, the bosses of the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This minute makes clear that, when the department approached the OECD and asked it what its attitude would be to such a review, the OECD, to its credit, made it quite clear that the department would not see any change in the OECD's reports on the accord; any reports it might issue in the future would be in accordance with reports it has issued in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This came as a surprise to the ACTU because, schooled in Australian politics, its view was that the problem with the OECD reports was that they had been issued by the economic department of the OECD. But suppose the report were written by the labour market directorate of the OECD. That would be a different matter entirely. Then there would be a chance of getting a favourable report out of the OECD. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department, on behalf of the ACTU, spoke to Mr Tom Alexander, the current head of the OECD's labour market directorate. Mr Tom Alexander, again to his credit, made it clear that he did not see any change in the OECD stance. In fact, he was being helpful by informing the department:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the easiest way to do such a study would be to undertake a comparative review of IR in four countries (say) e.g. Australia, NZ, UK and one other, possibly the US. In Mr Alexander's view&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the department states&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia would be unlikely to come out favourably in such a comparison . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This made the department stop and think. When the department cogitated about this, it came to the conclusion, of which it informed the minister:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, we think that the review options which have been canvassed in this area (as above) hold distinct dangers for the Government and little by way of compensating advantages.</PARA>
<PARA>The thing that comes through this minute is that there is a great danger&mdash;`danger' is written up there in lights, the alarm bells are ringing&mdash;in having the accord reported on by an independent agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dangers are very wide. There is the danger, of course, that the OECD would comment on the lack of wage flexibility that the accord and the ACTU have permitted. That lack of flexibility has squeezed out of the employment market those young Australians who lack skills and those people who are seeking retraining. There is the danger that the labour market regulation, introduced by the government, would be described by the OECD, in the view of the department, as having increased during the period of this government. As the department tells the minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.that labour market regulation has been increased through tighter occupational, health and safety standards; equal opportunity legislation; and non-wage labour costs, including the Training Guarantee, Superannuation Guarantee and payroll tax.</PARA>
<PARA>The department, in a bureaucratic way but a way we can all understand, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Careful consideration of these is required to ensure that they do not increase the employment costs of low-skilled workers . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, we know what they have done: they have increased the employment costs of low skilled workers, and that is why we have the unemployment that exists in Australia at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minute from the department shows that the government has received advice that its labour market programs would not stand up to impartial international scrutiny. The people who have been disadvantaged by this government&mdash;the unemployed, the long-term unemployed&mdash;will continue to be subjected to the deceit that comes from this government about the effects of the accord and its policies. But, when these policies are subjected to an independent scrutiny and an independent review, the government's warning bells ring `danger' because it knows that the truth will be told. That is the great danger. The great danger is that the OECD will tell the truth and expose the failure of this government to live up to what the Australian people expect of a government&mdash;to provide real jobs and employment opportunities. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OT4">Mr CHARLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not a long bow. It is a very direct accusation and it is true. This Labor government has an unemployment policy but no employment policy. It has never had one. It would not know how to devise one. It would not know how to start one, except for the fact that it has an employment policy to keep itself in government and its mates in the ACTU there along with it. We know that the President of the ACTU has a de facto position in cabinet. Who is the minute to&mdash;a minister who is an ex-president of the ACTU. Where is he now? He is in France, is he not? Is he not over there on OECD business? Is he not going to attempt to get the OECD to moderate its claims that the industrial relations system in Australia is inefficient and old fashioned? What are some of the things that the OECD had to say about our system?  It said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian industrial relations system is marked by strong wage&mdash;wage links. This has favoured the retention of incomes policies long after they have been discarded in other OECD countries.</PARA>
<PARA>As I recall, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has said in this place time and time again that we cannot control inflation if we do not have a wages policy. The OECD says clearly that the wages policy of this government is ineffective and has not progressed enterprise bargaining to the degree that we all know is necessary if we are going to have a flexible economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has deregulated the real economy but left us with a cosseted controlled industrial relations system, controlled, in essence, from ACTU House through a de facto cabinet position in this government. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training, ex-president of the ACTU, now wants the OECD to rewrite the rules. What is the advice of his department? His department says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The key general point is that we would have no assurance of control over the outcomes of a review, and that there is a distinct possibility of an uncomfortable set of findings regardless of which directorate has principle coverage.</PARA>
<PARA>That is because the ACTU officer suggested that perhaps the industrial relations division, not the economic division, of the OECD should look at this issue and that it might be more disposed towards a Labor government in Canberra than it otherwise would be. We now have this attempt by the ACTU, in collusion with the federal Labor government, to rewrite the rules. The Prime Minister did it well, did he not? He freely admitted it to the Canberra press gallery in December 1990. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have Treasury in my pocket, the Reserve Bank in my pocket, wages policy in my pocket, the financial community both here and overseas in my pocket.</PARA>
<PARA>He has bloody deep pockets, does he not? And now that mob over there wants the OECD in the government's pocket as well. So the ACTU, it seems, has incredibly long arms. This is one more example of a government of the ACTU, by the ACTU and for the ACTU. This is why we absolutely must suspend standing orders and debate this incredible contribution to this parliament and the country. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And those who ought to know have forgotten. The second thing that has been teased out by the production of this document is what the opposition's industrial relations policy is. In its kinder, more enlightened atmosphere, it is saying that we should be taking a more broadly based approach to things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the opposition said it would be a bad thing if a proposition came from the OECD that suggested that occupational health and safety standards should be reviewed favourably in the context of wages policy or wages development. The opposition is effectively saying that it would be a bad thing if equal opportunity legislation were to be in place in the industrial relations environment in terms of flexibility or whatever and that a finding on that would be welcomed by the opposition when wages policy is dealt with. In fact, those points were specifically made by the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), who moved this motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we actually start to look through this document, as I have been able to do in the last 15 minutes while members of the opposition were speaking, several things become very obvious. The first is that the OECD does not conduct its discussions in a vacuum. It is not a bunch of judges sitting in Europe arriving at pronouncements about the policy directions there ought to be in the individual countries which happen to be members of the OECD without consulting anyone or without any form of interaction with departments, governments or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD constantly keeps in place a process of consultation with the governments of the day in the countries which it is examining. At the end of the day it arrives at its own conclusions. There is no suggestion anywhere in this document that the government ought to go and sit inside the OECD, get that set of conclusions and rewrite them. It does arrive at a set of conclusions. But it generally arrives at draft positions before it arrives at those sets of conclusions, and those draft positions are discussed with the governments of the particular countries to see if there is any point they wish to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This document is about suggesting to the minister that he or the department ought to be making certain propositions to the OECD based on the information that they have seen thus far from the OECD draft notes, which ultimately lead to some form of country survey on industrial relations matters. It is entirely appropriate to advise a government, `You have to be aware that, if this line is persisted in by the OECD, you will find that certain conclusions are reached almost automatically  by the OECD. You might have a point to make to the OECD before it arrives at those conclusions, and these are the sorts of points you might like to make.' That is a perfectly normal communication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, which itself does not sit here in isolation talking to no-one, has from time to time had views expressed to it by various people&mdash;in this case, in a very minor part of the document, apparently it was an ACTU official concerned with employment policy who said that some sort of view ought to be presented to the OECD that took into account certain features of the Australian situation. Why not? They are Australian citizens. It would not matter whether it was the ACTU or some academic, as many academics do, who put forward suggestions to the Australian government about what it ought to say in response to draft notes or whatever that came from the OECD before those notes eventually emerge as a final country report. It could have been some members of the business community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those sections of the peak councils of the business community which have people who trace reporting that comes out of the OECD would, no doubt, also have points to make to the government on these particular propositions and would have been brought into those consultations. The point is that at the end of the day none of that amounts to improper interference. Every government makes its case to the OECD. The OECD has an enormous consultative process. There is not one jot or tittle of a suggestion that, at the end of the day when something is finally produced by the OECD, we need to mug the bloke who runs out of the building with the document to release it to the press so that we can rewrite it. That is the sort of proposition which underpins the opposition's principal objection to this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now let us see what the opposition was a little concerned about. When we look at this document, we find that the first point it is concerned about is that the draft notes that have appeared to this point contain no reference to the white paper or what the government intends to do in that area. The opposition feels that the OECD report ought to at least contain some elements that were related to that. We are entitled to wonder why the opposition would think that. Perhaps it would think that because paragraph 13 on page 4, `The main policy issues raised in this Note'&mdash;that is, the Labour Market Note for Australia which is still in draft form&mdash;in part states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.that temporary wage subsidies to the LTU have been made more widely available in recent years, and that this is an effective way of re-integrating the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an interesting little part of the note that has been put forward by the OECD as something that it might like to consider saying about the Australian system. In relation to the point that the temporary wage subsidies to the LTU have been made more widely available in recent years and that this is an effective way of reintegrating the unemployed, it is no wonder that we would want to have a thing or two to say about the white paper in that regard. That effectively means that if the OECD comes out and turns the note into a draft report it is saying, `This is a good thing to do and do more of it.' The opposition has been spending a considerable amount of time telling us that that is exactly the wrong thing to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is flushed by this particular proposition because it ought to be thought of in the context that the coalition is now the only conservative party in the world that actually opposes subsidised labour market programs to assist the long-term unemployed. That the OECD, which is a fairly conservative organisation on these matters, regards that as a matter to note and as a matter that ought to be put forward is a thundering indictment of the sorts of propositions that the opposition has managed to arrive at. The opposition outlines further things people are worried about that might emerge in the note. The next point in paragraph 13 is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.that labour market regulation has increased through tighter occupational, health and safety standards; equal opportunity legislation; and non-wage labour costs, including the Training Guarantee, Superannuation Guarantee and payroll tax.</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to hear the opposition now supports payroll tax. I am pleased to hear the opposition on the subject of superannuation guarantee. If the opposition complains about us, what must it say about all the European countries, virtually all of whom have some form of taxation arrangements in their wage structures or in their taxation systems that picks up exactly those sorts of points as far as superannuation guarantee is concerned?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is suggested by implication by the opposition in the debate here is that we ought to be totally unmoved by a report that comes out and says that having in place equal opportunity legislation and occupational health and safety legislation is a bad thing and that it increases difficulties with labour market flexibility. These are the sorts of problems the department is drawing attention to. It is saying to the minister, `You might want to present an argument that this is a reasonable thing to have within a report that comes down on Australia and that ought not be a criticism of Australia.' If the opposition thinks those things add to inflexibility to an extent that is unacceptable and wishes them removed, then it should advocate it. It should have the guts to get out there and advocate it. The document says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the need for a more flexible wages structure which better relates pay to skill and provides incentives for skill formation.</PARA>
<PARA>That is fine. That is the proposition it wishes to put forward. But it was quite evident from what the opposition spokesperson said that the opposition is still running around with the flexibility downers. It is still running around saying, `It would be a problem if we had an unfavourable comparison with New Zealand and with the United Kingdom where the working poor do not get paid a living wage.' That is where it wishes us to end up. That is what I said at the beginning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has teased out a very interesting industrial agenda. The opposition has not understood the document it has had before it. Those opposite cannot help the fact that they have been in opposition for so long that they do not comprehend these things. They have not understood the document they have had before them.

<PARA>In one way or another these matters are related to legislation which has to have a start-up date at the beginning of the financial year. Some of them are budget measures which will significantly impact on the revenue and expenditure outcomes of the government. Others, such as the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill (No. 2), are related to matters which the government believes need to be concluded quickly.All of them, in the way in which they appear in the House in the form of a guillotine, are related to the fact that we must have our legislative proposals for the Senate concluded by the end of this week if it is to be able to give them due consideration before that date. That is not an unreasonable requirement by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From time to time I have had occasion to remark on unreasonable requirements by the Senate, but in this case we are talking about a concluding date at the end of this month and we are already four or five days into it. For the Senate to be able to conclude it by the end of this month, it does need several weeks consideration, which concluding these matters in the next couple of days will give it. Unlike my usual form when moving guillotines, where I introduce the fact that the Senate imposes heinous limits on the House, I can scarcely complain about that in these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note&mdash;because I think the point will be made, and I do not really want to speak again in the debate&mdash;that the provisions that were put in place by the government to change the practices of the House were to some degree intended to militate the need for the guillotining of legislation, yet we still put forward a guillotine. Those measures, I remind the House, include the provision of a second chamber. They also, effectively, include a decision by the government to operate three sittings a year instead of two sittings a year and to move away from our pattern of trying to pass everything in one sittings at each point in the two sittings for the year. By and large, we have been able to keep that up. This is by no means as severe a guillotine as we have put in place in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, irrespective of whether or not we were trying to operate without a guillotine at all, if we are actually going to get the benefits of an early budget, a budget produced in May with a start-up time in the early part of the financial year, some form of guillotining for a fair bit of budget legislation is virtually unavoidable. Hence the guillotine which is in place as of this moment and this guillotine which is suggested for this legislation. I do not need to add anything more to that, except to urge the House to support the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A funny thing seemed to happen on the way to the second chamber. The whole idea of the second chamber was to relieve the burden on the House of Representatives in relation to routine legislation. It is quite ironic that the second chamber is opening for business tomorrow, for the first time, and this is the second guillotine we have had in three days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard a lot of motions to bring in the guillotine moved by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), and none lacked heart quite like the last one. He was not very enthusiastic about it at all. He knows deep down that this one is totally without justification. It lacks any merit. He cannot even blame the Senate on this occasion. He actually said that it is necessary to comply with a reasonable requirement of the Senate. Normally he can stretch it and dredge up some kind of complaint about the Senate. It seems to be bred in those on the other side to blame the Senate when something goes wrong, but he could not even do that on this occasion. I will not delay the House with a long speech. I do not think this motion has any merit at all. The opposition will oppose it and we will call a division. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join in protesting the seemingly regular occurrence of yet another guillotine. I do not think it would matter what changes this government made to the standing orders; we would still have guillotines. If we had seven chambers and not two, there would still be guillotines. There just does not seem to be any capacity to manage the business program. We wait until the last few days, until the sun is setting on the sittings, and then a whole stack of legislation which is suddenly considered to be urgent is rushed into the chamber and there is an expectation that it will be dealt with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time that I have been a member of this chamber, over half of all of the legislation to come before the parliament has been subject to guillotine. I think that is a pretty appalling record. When I tell my constituents about that, they are amazed that the centrepiece of our democratic process could operate so badly and that so much of our legislation&mdash;so many of the important bills and so many of the changes that the government proposes to bring into our way of life&mdash;is not adequately debated in the parliament because time is not permitting. The clock determines when the vote is taken rather than the parliament being ready to reach a decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the obvious consequences of this has been the incidence of bills having to come back into the chamber to fix up the mistakes. When legislation is rushed through without proper consideration and without adequate time to carefully review the issues involved, it is inevitable that legislation that is shoddy in preparation or, in some instances, even bad in concept will go through the chamber and then have to be fixed up at a later time. This is really an unsatisfactory way for the parliament of a democratic country to operate. What kind of an example do we set for other parts of the world and the Australian people when we cannot manage our own affairs better than this?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not a great fan of the second chamber. I do not believe that it will contribute anything worth while to the processes of the parliament. When we have to deal with another guillotine on the eve of the second chamber commencing its first sittings, this clearly demonstrates that the second chamber has failed before it has even started. The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) said that this guillotine is not as severe as others. There is only one reason for that: the government does not have many bills around at the present time. If it did, this guillotine would have been much more severe. There are only half a dozen bills on this list because that is all that is around. Had there been 20 or 30 bills, they would have all been guillotined. I am aware of one bill on the program that is going to the second chamber because it apparently fits into the non-controversial class that is allowed to be discussed there. But, basically, very little of the legislation is going in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One improvement to the parliamentary process is the referral of a number of bills to House of Representatives committees. I commend the government on that process. It obviously remains to be seen how seriously the government will take on board the recommendations of those committees, but it is a very positive step which needs to be commended. That will slow down some legislation, and I accept that fact. But, hopefully, it will reduce the number of occasions on which legislation has to be brought back in order to have faults corrected. Hopefully, it will also reduce the number of times that the Senate has to do our job for us, namely, tidying the legislation up and correcting the most obvious errors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am disappointed that, on the eve of the first sittings of the second chamber, we will again be treated to another guillotine. The debate on another series of bills will again be limited. This follows the really cruel limitations that were applied to this year's debates on Appropriation Bill (No. 1). We were allowed half an hour to deal with each department. In fact, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, which incorporates quite a lot of the substance of government, was dealt with for only 10 minutes because the time allowed for that department had expired so soon after the debate had commenced. That is not a proper way to scrutinise the budget. That is not a proper way to scrutinise the business and the affairs that the government is putting before the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should be condemned for this guillotine. It is right that we divide on it. The government will again use its numbers mercilessly, as it will do with each of these pieces of legislation, in order to force this legislation through, irrespective of its merits and, in this instance, irrespective of the opportunity that the parliament or the Australian people have had to examine its contents and quality. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MI4">Mr PEACOCK</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Kooyong)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (4.55 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the limited time available to me to discuss the proposed expenditure for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade I want to focus on the aid budget and its consistent decline over the last 10 years of Labor government&mdash;its decline whatever way you wish to measure it: its decline per capita, its decline as a percentage of per capita income, its decline as a percentage of GNP, and its decline as a percentage of total federal government expenditure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's GNP per capita has risen by $4,700 in real terms in the 10 years since this Labor government came to power, but aid expenditure has declined by $5 per capita over the same period. This represents a fall from 0.5 per cent of per capita income when Labor came to power to 0.33 per cent in this year's budget. In responding to a question in this chamber last Wednesday, the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) had the gall to suggest that this appalling record could be compared favourably with the record of the previous Liberal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want today to correct the minister's misrepresentation of the facts. In 1985-86, in its second full financial year in office, Labor cut the aid budget by 4.8 per cent in real terms which caused the aid to GNP ratio to drop significantly from the healthy 0.49 per cent which it inherited from the Fraser government. The following year, in 1986-87, Labor cut the aid budget again, this time by a massive 12 per cent in real terms, which saw the aid budget drop to 0.38 per cent of GNP for that year. The following year, in 1987-88, Labor again repeated this performance by making another cut of 2.5 per cent in real terms, and in 1989-90 Labor presided over another very large 7.5 per cent drop in budget spending which took the aid budget to its lowest ever level of funding as a percentage of GNP, namely, 0.33 per cent. Had the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, not intervened at the last minute in a desperate response to widespread calls for action from private aid agencies and me, the aid budget would have again fallen to 0.33 per cent. The fact is that the Prime Minister intervened just enough to ensure that the aid to GNP ratio would reach a miserable 0.34 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor government made a very firm election promise to take the percentage of aid to GNP back to 0.4 per cent in this 1994-95 budget. Yet another lie. The government deliberately broke this promise. Indeed, this year the government has made no further mention of any such commitment. The minister and the government have lost all credibility with the public on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to the aid budget, the Australian Council for Overseas Aid and Community Aid Abroad have mentioned a number of community concerns about the aid budget: its geographic focus, its emphasis on commercialism and on large infrastructure projects, and the need for balance between contributions to multilateral and bilateral channels for aid distribution. Indeed, there is now very widespread debate, including within the general community, on all these aid quality issues. The decline in the aid budget, the government's loss of credibility and the widespread community debate on aid quality issues lead me to the conclusion that it is high time the government's aid program was subjected to a full-scale independent review. The consensus achieved through the Jackson committee report on the overall orientation and priorities in the aid program, which was handed down in 1984, has well and truly disintegrated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, in my view, well-founded and growing grounds for concern that taxpayers' money is potentially being misdirected and even wasted through the aid budget. There is evidence of actual project failure, there is evidence of inadequate effectiveness evaluation, there is evidence of inadequate attention to environmental and social impact assessment, and there is strong suspicion of related administrative inefficiency and lack of capability. The government is not taking sufficiently seriously the need for periodic effectiveness reviews of aspects of the aid program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Take as an example the fact that AIDAB, jointly with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of the Treasury, has recently completed an extensive high level review of the effectiveness of our multilateral aid. The review took the time of three senior executive officers and an independent academic consultant. It covered approximately $320 million of taxpayers' money that the government spends on the multilateral agencies. The minister responsible has been disinclined to publish this report. But surely the general public, the taxpayer, is entitled to this information. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many members on both sides of the House would agree with the push to increase the aid budget and would have some concerns about the deterioration of aid over the last decade, but the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) has a hide to get up on this subject. When we start deploring how bad that budget is, it has to be seen in the context of the opposition's Fightback policy to reduce the total aid budget by $209 million. That has to be seen in the wider context of reducing taxation take and the all the more deplorable reality out there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One point that I would like to commend in this budget is the government's reassertion of its activity around family planning, which relates in turn to the inquiry into its effectiveness. That expenditure of over $130 million over the next three years will encompass a variety of programs throughout our region. In the Philippines, a network of service providers in 15 municipalities, including two to three of the poorest, will be designated by the Philippine government. In Indonesia, there is a very high rate of maternal mortality. It is recognised by UNICEF, which is running programs there. In Vietnam, money is allocated for primary health care, immunisation against trachoma, et cetera, and, in the Philippines, the poorest regions of the country such as Zamboanga will have access to family planning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This reassertion of the government's activity to this end comes after a thorough inquiry into the effectiveness of our program. After all the complaints which came down to personnel and individuals, and attacks on the people undertaking the inquiry, the committee of inquiry came to a fairly strong conclusion that Australia's program was worth while, merited and should continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be a greater assertion in future programs so that any coercive aspects to family planning will be strongly counted. The current world population of 5.6 billion people is projected by the United Nations population fund to rise to between 7.6 billion and 7.9 billion as early as the year 2015. It is no good saying that government action and foreign aid activity are not related to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, a document by Population Action International, entitled `World access to birth control: 1987 to 1982', traced the very different levels of improvement or worsening of population growth in a variety of countries. It was not just a matter of things happening in a haphazard fashion; it showed a clear relationship between activity, expenditure and improvement. Thus, we have seen certain countries&mdash;even in Africa, with its overwhelming problems in that direction&mdash;such as Botswana, Lesotho and Zambia making massive steps forward because of the degree of government activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been estimated that, to meet the world's requirements of enough contraceptives to fully meet unmet demand in family planning by the year 2000, $11 billion will be required. After all of the huffing and the puffing, all of the capitulation to political pressures and political realities in the Senate, the committee of inquiry came down with a very strong endorsement and a very strong reiteration of Australia's need to act in this field. That is a commendable aspect of the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Similarly, there is a new emphasis, and $20 million within the total DIFF program is being advanced to green projects. That has two aspects: first, it is merited. It is something we should be doing. We should be looking at delivery of sanitation, emphasising clean water to people and making sure that prominent projects just for national image do not take the centre part, but that these other projects with a green and environmental emphasis should be there. The second aspect is that it counters OECD pressures that are sometimes a bit too restrictive in regard to supposed emphasis on commercial orientation in some of these projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want very briefly to talk about the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau's program of training for Eurasia. Some of my constituents, particularly in the Ukrainian community, have raised a requirement that the government should press on</PARA>
<PARA>with this program which has accounted for $9 1/2 million over the last five years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia's intelligence community is in a state of crisis. Let me make these points: the government has structured its three so-called inquiries to ensure that the relationship between the investigators and the investigated is so close as to preclude objective inquiries. Friends are investigating friends. Mr Michael Codd, one of the two royal commissioners for the ASIS inquiry and former secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, for years had an overview role of those areas he is looking into in his capacity as Chairman of the Secretaries Committee on Intelligence and Security. Is he now examining his own handiwork?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Michael Cook, who is running the general security inquiry, was Director-General of the Office of National Assessments from 1981 to 1989. One of ONA's functions is to report on the efficiency of ASIO. Is Mr Cook also investigating his friends or his own performance? In addition, ASIO's own senior officers are carrying out their own internal inquiry. However, it is common knowledge that the inquiry by the Australian Federal Police into ASIO called `Operation Liver' was sufficiently alarming to the government to bring about the present inquiry. External concern has again been internalised. Moreover, given the interconnected nature of so much of the work undertaken by the various services, three separate inquiries are cumbersome, duplicative and a waste of taxpayers' funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look closer at the real problems. Why, for instance, was Valeriy Zemskov&mdash;after British intelligence determined from the debriefing of Soviet defector Oleg Gordievsky in late 1985 that he was a member of the elite KGB special reserve&mdash;subsequently allowed to enter Australia, despite the federal Labor government being informed of his real status? Why did the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade&mdash;DFAT&mdash;push so hard for his entry and who were members of the influence network he built of senior Australian public servants?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, what were his relationships with very senior DFAT officers? What is the government hiding? What were the ramifications over time of ASIS officers being married to foreign nationals, including some cases where that foreigner had been an officer of a foreign intelligence service? This is an utterly extraordinary situation which would not have been allowed in the American, British or other major western intelligence services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also ask the government: what is really going on in ASIO? Have two Canberra-based Russian translators been forcibly retired in recent months, plus another individual used more on a consultancy basis? Is it true that the government preferred them to go quietly rather than have to take action against them? The public and this parliament are entitled to know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Has ASIO's entire phone system been replaced and are its computers being cleaned out because they may have been compromised by Russian intelligence? The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his government can no longer shield their mates from inspection and parliamentary scrutiny. What, I ask again, is this government hiding? An estimated $203.9 million is being spent on Australia's five intelligence organisations in 1993-94, about 20 per cent more than the $168.7 million spent in 1991-92. In 1993-94, ASIO will cost an estimated $46.6 million and ASIS will cost $31.8 million. These are very significant amounts of public expenditure. The community properly expects value for money. It also wants answers from the government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was indicating earlier, this particular program has in the past five years of its operation helped train over 200 people from eastern Europe. It involves bridging courses in English, updating computer skills, a graduate certificate in business administration and then eight weeks placement in Australian industry. It is interesting to see not only the diversity of the countries from which these people derive but also the diversity of industries and interests they have. It has ranged from running national lotteries, the Rega zoo, the glass industry, international trade, et cetera.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to support the continuation of this program by the government. We are all aware of the reorganisation of industry that is occurring in many countries in eastern Europe. We are all aware of the difficulties within their educational systems, their funding problems, et cetera. This matter will be of particular interest to the significant number of people of Ukrainian descent in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One matter of concern in the budget is the continuing decline in the amount of aid given to Africa. It is all right for people to talk about the fact that, overall, there might be many millions more in Asia who are also in dire circumstances. But, indisputably, the circumstance in Africa is such that there is not a real comparison. Many of the countries in Asia that we speak of as having significant problems are those that are quite obviously on the verge of a major economic upturn. One of those countries is Vietnam; this budget does show a major reorientation and emphasis on the Indochina region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Between 1960 and 1989, Africa's share of global gross national product has dropped from the low level of 1.9 per cent to only 1.2 per cent. This budget's very minimal increase in aid to that continent, in the face of its monumental problems, is a questionable policy decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More positive is the $100 million augmentation of non-government funding. In recent years we have seen increased questioning of the operation of the projects of international financial organisations. The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) said earlier that we should perhaps question Australia's performance in this area. Quite frankly, we would not be the only one in that playing field. Internationally, in cases where a variety of banks have questioned the effectiveness of a country's programs, they have had recourse to outside reviews. They are showing that, perhaps too often, the governments of the day&mdash;in societies with very little pluralism or democracy&mdash;basically put those projects in directions that are not necessarily for the good of the general population, and that our aid program is basically aiding an infrastructure of corruption and nepotism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are doing in this country by reinforcing the NGOs means that there will be an oversight of programs overseas. That will facilitate the strengthening of NGOs in other countries. It will ensure that the emphasis is not all the time on major capital construction, which has very little value to people. Thousands of farmers are forced off their land just because some engineer thinks it is a great idea to build a dam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the government for the new rural development program in East Timor. It is necessary that Australia places a degree of emphasis not only on the wider impoverished eastern region but more particularly on Timor. It is important that we utilise this program not only to improve the living conditions of the Timorese but also to manage, through the presence of Australian aid officers, in some way to restrict the degree of human rights abuses by the Indonesian government in that province. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The government, as part of its current review of the export market development grant scheme, has a responsibility to sort that out quickly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The export market development grants scheme is an important scheme, but the Auditor-General's report indicates that it has been drifting in recent times. So it is that the outcome of the scheme has been inadequate. In more recent days there have been some broader criticisms of the scheme. We want to see an effective scheme which is not in any way rorted or able to be rorted but which does supply real benefit and help to the small business operators and others that pick up on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Related to that I make the additional point that it would seem that the export access scheme, which I think has some merit as well, is in many ways showing a clean pair of heels with regard to its performance. To cite one example, the venison producers of Victoria took up with the export access scheme last year and, as a consequence, they have had a 150 per cent increase in the success of their exports. This scheme is quite separate from Austrade and quite separate from the export market development grants scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I call on the government to expedite its review of the export market development grants scheme to provide a focus and to provide performance benchmarking, as called for in the Auditor-General's report. I would like to believe that the new Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan, might respond in the parliament on the outcome of the review of the EMDG scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be no complacency about the performance of our export assistance programs. I ask the question: how effective are they and how wise is the reliance placed upon them? The proposition advanced by the government that exports to the Asian region have been achieved by government and private sector efforts to improve Australia's share of these markets is simply wrong. Behind the gloss that the government paints over Australia's exports to Asia is the inescapable reality that, irrespective of the injection of funding, we are losing ground as an exporter to the region. We are losing market share, most notably to such places as Malaysia and Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Australia's regional exports are increasing, largely as a consequence of the phenomenal economic growth experienced by the east Asian economic tigers, they are not growing fast enough to keep pace with the markets at which they are aimed. Furthermore, Australia is significantly outpaced by many of our competitors in those markets in which we have managed to improve our market share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the three Chinas and South Korea more than doubled their share of the Singapore import market last year, as did Japan and others. In Thailand, South Korea more than doubled its market share, while the Chinese economies and Japan also registered an increase in market share. Overall Australia's share of the east Asia import market as a whole declined from 4 per cent in the early 1980s to 3.5 per cent by 1992. The implication of these outcomes is that we are failing to effectively integrate with the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sure, there is some effort. Sure, the Northern Territory government and others are putting a real practical edge to that linkage with Asia. But, when we look at the market share dimension, are we really holding our ground in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand? The truth of the matter is that we are being outwitted; competitors are gaining market share at our expense; and our market share is declining. That is why it is necessary that we see absolute performance benchmarking and real outcome from the programs of export assistance provided by the government, including, most notably, the export market development grants scheme&mdash;the subject of some provision with regard to the budgetary legislation before the House at this time. </PARA>

We reported, and reported favourably, on the election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would take this opportunity to inform the House of some of the conclusions reached by the Commonwealth Observer Group, because it is important to understand the context in which the South African election was conducted. Even in the best of circumstances, the deadlines set for the election were going to create enormous and monumental tasks for the Independent Electoral Commission that was set up to conduct the election and to deliver the goods. It was only set up in December 1993 and it had a very short time frame in which to operate. It was challenged even more so when changes were made to require separate ballot papers for the national and provincial elections, and later the participation of the Inkatha Freedom Party. There was no roll. People did not even know the size of the population. People were free to vote anywhere in the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against the context of those enormous logistical difficulties, it had to run a campaign. It had had no previous experience in voting. It had to conduct voter education programs, to introduce people who were unfamiliar with elections to the concept. It had to put in place arrangements to issue valid identity documents. It had to appoint staff who, in many cases, had no substantial administrative experience to represent the whole of the population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The campaign was one in which there were expected tensions. They were eased considerably as a result of the inclusion of the Inkatha Freedom Party. But, tragically, some bombings and shootings occurred during the time I was there. There were some concerns about the elections, concerns about the way in which the poll was conducted in particular places,  given the difficulties about which I have spoken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission was not able to provide proper security for all of the electoral materials that were important to the conduct of the campaign. Regulations and procedures changed so rapidly that a lot of procedures were improperly carried out, even in relation to the elections themselves. There were numerous reports of irregularities, and our report details those. There were problems in the counting of the ballot and the transport and storage of ballot papers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we have to judge the performance against the difficulties experienced in conducting this particular campaign. For the majority of South Africans, the election was more than the exercise of a democratic choice; it was a particularly unique opportunity for the first time for most of them to be able to do what we take so much for granted. And, of course, it meant the demise of the apartheid system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a news release dated 3 May 1994, we state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the final analysis, the elections represented a free and clear expression of the will of the South African people. The outcome was the result of a credible democratic process which was substantially fair.</PARA>
<PARA>We go on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not believe that abuses were widespread or had a determinative impact on the overall result. We are confident that the new South African Government will want to reinforce impartial and independent mechanisms for analysing these difficulties in preparing for the next elections. In nurturing the culture of democracy, there is much to say in favour of maintaining a mechanism for organising and conducting future elections which are perceived to be impartial and independent of government structures.</PARA>

But our particular complaint, resulting from a few days that we spent visiting Bosnia-Herzegovina, was that the United Nations took a peculiar approach to our visit&mdash;a visit about which the UN had been forewarned. In fact, there had been reasonably high level negotiations in Washington and New York prior to the departure of our international delegation to Frankfurt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the first instance, we were supposed to have flown from Wiesbaden to Sarajevo direct with the United States Air Force in one of its supply aircraft.

In Croatia we then had to negotiate with UNPROFOR to allow us to go to conduct our visit. That visit, I might add, was, in fact, at the behest of the government of Bosnia-Herzegovina. In fact, we were invited by the legitimate, elected government of that independent nation, which is recognised by the United Nations. </PARA>

We found ourselves in a continuous series of meetings negotiating in an attempt to get permission for more and more people to go. We had a party of around about 20 people overall. In the first instance, the UNPROFOR administration would only allow two to go. We had the somewhat unsavoury experience of sitting down and trying to decide who, of all the people who had travelled from all around the world to be part of what we considered to be a significant international delegation, would go to Bosnia-Herzegovina. This was at a time, I might add, when there was considerable international pressure, not the least from the Secretary-General of the United Nations but also from Bosnia-Herzegovina's government, to accept peace negotiations which would have led to partition and cantonisation&mdash;the very same result that had been rejected at the London conference the year before by a combination of the then Secretary-General of the United Nations and John Major, who at the time was chairing the conference on behalf of the European Community. So we had the situation where we were in Zagreb, Croatia, trying to ensure that we could travel to Sarajevo the next day.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a shame that this government has not developed an industry policy. If the government had an industry policy, I think it would fall under the title of slash and burn. Honourable members will recall that under the Whitlam regime we had an overnight instant cut to tariffs of 25 per cent across the board. A great number of companies disappeared into the sunset never to reappear and other major manufacturing companies in Australia never recovered from the Whitlam escapades. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor's approach to the problems generated by tariffs is simply to cut tariffs. Why do tariffs occur in the first place? They occur because some governments and industry thought that we needed a mixed economy, that we needed to base Australia's economic foundations on more than just commodities, although those commodities have provided the wealth of the nation. Some of the income from the commodities was diverted into tariffs to protect an emerging manufacturing sector in Australia, so that some industries on our own shores could, albeit with a small population, manufacture and supply a reasonable percentage of Australia's needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hawke and now Keating Labor governments have progressively reduced tariffs to industry. Unfortunately, with the exception of the automotive industry and minor concessions to the clothing, textiles and footwear industry, it has provided little cost relief in return. Instead of deregulating the labour market first, it deregulated the financial markets and the industry market by immediately cutting tariffs and leaving a cosseted, structured and more or less centralised labour market. This government, not understanding industry and the mentality of those scientists, technologists and engineers who might design and develop products that the Australian population might consume, has cut the foundation upon which they existed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that behind that tariff wall we built up some very inefficient manufacturing practices, rotten quality and very poor, if any, marketing techniques in terms of developing marketing for those products which we made, which we might have sold to the rest of the world.

If we do not, the day has almost passed when we will be able to survive as a mixed economic nation. We are faced with the growing tigers in South-East Asia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the sorts of entries which reflect the commitment that this government has had to ensuring that our industries are internationally competitive, that we have a commitment to developing good Australian ideas and a commitment to trading our way in the world. That is reflected by the Working Nation statement itself. It is interesting, I think, to draw attention to the success that we have had in the exporting area. Page 55 of Working Nation states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Services exports have sustained real growth rates of over 8 per cent on average from 1983 to 1993 . . . Export propensity in manufacturing rose from 14 per cent to 24 per cent between 1982-83 and 1992-93. Australian exports of elaborately transformed manufactured goods grew at an annual rate of 17.3 per cent from 1984 to 1992&mdash;an export growth performance which places us in the top league of countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development . . . In 1983, East Asian market economies accounted for 30 per cent of Australian manufactured exports. By 1992, these economies accounted for almost half these exports.</PARA>
<PARA>That reflects the success that we have had in trying to turn Australia into a modern, industrial trading nation.

The main budget allocation of $423 million is much the same this year as last year but, because of the reduction in a special grant of $50 million a year, which was instituted in 1989 for five years, the Chief Executive of the CSIRO, John Stocker, believes that there is an effective $15 million reduction.</PARA></TALK.START>

This is reminiscent of the old in-tourist approach to travelling around the Soviet Union. You could meet anyone you liked provided there was a KGB minder to eavesdrop on the conversation. That is the approach that this government adopts with the union members who are part of the CSIRO staff rightly protesting against these misdirected cuts. These staff members are doing the right thing by the nation in protesting against these cuts not by going on strike but by staging a work-in.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I echo some of the sentiments expressed by my colleague the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) and also some of the concerns of my constituents in the electorate of Parkes by commenting on the cuts the government is making to the CSIRO. It was not all that many years ago that the government was trumpeting terms like `the clever country'. I think the reality today is that any real chance of a recovery is being held back because we are being run by a dumb government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are seeing on projections that the CSIRO, which has already been cut back, will have about $20 million a year wiped off its budget over the next three years. In particular, the Institute of Animal Production and Processing and the Institute of Plant Production and Processing, two of the most vital divisions in the CSIRO, are going to take more than their fair share of these cuts. These two areas alone employ 47 per cent of CSIRO's staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On projections so far, there is going to be a net loss of 138 positions, including three research scientists, and to some extent 21 scientists. What alarms me just as much is that of the 27 research sites the CSIRO has, 10 are to be sold, including some which have been purchased wholly or in part by wool growers' levy funds. On top of this we are going to see some areas transferred. For example, the Division of Wool Technology at Ryde is apparently going to be moved to Geelong. From what has been said so far, we will lose possibly 90 per cent or more of the scientists there because they are refusing, understandably, to move to Geelong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will list some of the properties that the CSIRO has purchased with grants from wool funds. At Armidale, New South Wales, we have the Arding Field Station, 325 hectares; the Chiswick Field Station and Research Laboratory, 1,512 hectares; and the Longford Field Station, 974 hectares. At Prospect in Sydney we have the Ian Clunies Ross Animal Research Laboratory, 57 hectares; at Ryde, the Division of Wool Technology, 1 1/2 hectares; at Belmont in Geelong, Victoria, the Division of Wool Technology, 6.3 hectares; at Deniliquin, New South Wales, the Faulkner Memorial Field Station, 2,499 hectares; at O'Halloran Hill, South Australia, the Glenthorne Field Station, 75 hectares; and at Baker's Hill, Western Australia, the Yalanbee experimental station, 840 hectares. These were all purchased by wool levy funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the government that the wool industry has been particularly hard hit and it appears that at least half the cuts are going to fall on the divisions of wool technology, the divisions of animal production and the division of animal health. The losses are going to be particularly great. Rural research overall is going to suffer very much. Already since 1991-92 we have had a reduction of 400 staff in the CSIRO overall. Two hundred and forty-three of those 400 have fallen in the Institute of Animal Production and Processing and in the Institute of Plant Production and Processing, 61 per cent of the total retrenchments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is going to be a double whammy for rural industry. Its funds and resources are falling because rural R&amp;D organisations' contributions are falling off due to the fact that the quantity of wool in this country has fallen and the government contributions have fallen also. Aside from this we have had wool promotion funding by this government slashed from $20 million last year to zero and the exceptional circumstances funding for hard hit wool growers, such as in the electorate of Parkes, is to be terminated totally from 30 June this year. </PARA>

The CSIRO has released a set of proposals which are designed to position itself to provide long-term sustainable support for its animal, food and fibre industries. Under these proposals the CSIRO will maintain its research effort in the face of the effect of the rural industry downturn, particularly in the wool sector. It will be consolidating from 27 to 17 sites, cutting overheads and administrative costs and freeing resources for research. The CSIRO still devotes about 40 per cent of its budget to agricultural research. This exceeds the rural sector's share of the Australian economy and of Australia's exports and reflects the CSIRO's firm commitment to the rural sector.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons for a lot of the alleged concerns being expressed by opposition members is that there have been changing industry research priorities and we must have regard to the current downturn of the wool research funding.

<PARA>That is pretty stirring stuff when one considers that as politicians we should always remain responsible. Responsibility is an interesting concept in view of the many recent backflips of the senator's namesake and of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton). Assigning blame is the key in that senator's statement and, as we review the recent statements of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Industrial Relations, we can refer to it as well.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has doomed the white paper is the IR bill introduced last year. It is quite absurd one month to pass laws that act as a disincentive to employment and then introduce a white paper that is supposed to reduce unemployment the next. The white paper addresses symptoms, not the causes. The large amounts of money in this budget will be spent on training and are not a substitute for a sound industrial relations policy that promotes the mutual interest of employers and employees. When it comes to explaining the contribution industrial relations reform will make to reducing unemployment, it has nothing to offer but flaccid and exaggerated rhetoric. </PARA>

In that particular count, I did not include pig farmers, nor did I include sandwich shop owners. I should have because the recent sandwich shop fiasco was a good example of rhetoric gone crazy. A Labor industry minister asked an employee within his own business not to take wages until a profit was made. That is some sort of enterprise bargaining, I am sure, but it is totally opposite to government policy and so abhorrent to those on our side, for we are from business and would never be so cruel and ruthless as to treat our employees in such a manner.

What we have seen in the last 10 years are reforms out of the accord process, providing stability on wage outcomes in a very important atmosphere of cooperation with the trade union movement.

These business people think they are stepping down when they come into this parliament, but they step down to continue kicking the trade union movement.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of ILO conventions into Australia's industrial relations system further threatens employment in this country. The more obstacles that one puts in the place of employment and the more disadvantages one puts in front of employers, the more difficult it is for employers to run their own businesses, and the less likely they are to put on extra staff. It also upsets the federal balance in our constitutional situation. Australia, with one million people out of work, needs more real jobs. ILO conventions do not create jobs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He is very sensitive. He ought to be, considering the record of those opposite in industrial relations and their attitude in this place over the last 10 or 12 years and certainly long before that. The honourable member was a member of the former National Party government in his state. He was a member of the National Party, but he jumped to the Liberal Party, which has a similar policy on industrial relations&mdash;and its policies are always pretty crook. We all know that the honourable member was a Joh man from way back.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The industrial relations aspects of the budget are very important. They certainly have not received the media coverage that other areas of the budget have rightly received in the broader community. I welcome the opportunity this evening to make a few comments on the industrial relations aspects of the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget allocates a total of $356.5 million to the industrial relations portfolio in 1994-95, which incidentally represents a fall of just on 7.4 per cent. It seems to contradict the occasional comments from the opposition that the government is attempting to set up a giant industrial relations bureaucracy that is intent on crushing small business. Nothing could be further from the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the contrary, the industrial relations arm of the budget will provide some very real benefits for the business community. For example, funding of nearly $16 million will be provided for the work place reform and best practice program, which consists of the following two elements. Firstly, the best practice component will focus on small and medium-sized enterprises with the announcement in August of the successful applicants for initial project funding. Secondly, from 1 July, the workplace reform element will be refocused to promote the spread of enterprise bargaining. It will provide grants to enterprises seeking to include agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To ensure bargaining is an inclusive process, this program will offer assistance to those engaged in enterprise bargaining to deal with the needs of women and other disadvantaged groups. This is a very welcome initiative. Women, particularly young women, now make up a significant proportion of the work force, yet they are not equally represented on union executives, some notable exceptions notwithstanding. It also follows on the heels of the welcome appointment of a distinguished woman, Justice Deirdre O'Connor, as president of our new Industrial Relations Court. In relation to that issue, in yesterday's media we saw that the wages of women are still not keeping pace with those of men. That is an area that obviously needs a lot of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Some of the initiatives in the industrial relations portfolio share of the budget cover the Asia initiative. Funding of $200,000 in 1994-95 and $300,000 in later years will be provided to assist Asian economies with the development of sound industrial relations practices. This funding will be spent on issues such as occupational health and safety education programs, labour law and administration, collective bargaining, strengthening tripartisan arrangements dispute settlement, labour inspections, child labour and minimum wages laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1994-95, funding of $200,000 will be provided for Comcare Australia to assist in the implementation of nationally uniform occupational health and safety standards. There will be $334,000 provided for the Affirmative Action Agency to meet staffing costs associated with an increased workload. Of these funds, $100,000 will be to upgrade the agency's information and technology system, and $75,000 will be for a project officer to assist with programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another very important area&mdash;as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, from your experience on the committees that you and I are involved in, particularly in the Aboriginal affairs area&mdash;is that there are major problems for Aboriginal and Islander people, particularly women, across the board. I welcome those initiatives in the budget. There is also $2 million to be provided for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and registry to meet costs in implementing reforms associated with the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993. With the budget and the white paper, I think we can be very proud of what has happened in industrial relations. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today the House of Representatives heard an incredible story of attempted intervention by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) in an industrial relations issue that relates to a report by the OECD which, amongst other things, commented unfavourably&mdash;at least according to the ACTU&mdash;on Australia's industrial relations record. It is a sad and sorry record. This government has done nothing whatsoever to help accelerate the pace of change, to give us more flexibility in the labour market, to allow firms to negotiate directly with their employees, and to give us a system that allows high wages and not just the low wage outcomes that we have had for 11 years under Labor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the government's response today, denying the opposition the opportunity to fully debate this issue, in essence it was saying, `If you don't like the truth, just get someone else to write it.' That is the view of history the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) takes. He comes into this place and other places and constantly attempts to rewrite Australian history in order to suit the purposes of the Australian Labor Party. The note to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training relating to the OECD report, which we heard about earlier today, went on to say that there is a labour market note for Australia being prepared by the OECD which is still in draft form. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main policy issues raised in this Note are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.that restructuring of awards and introduction of enterprise-based bargaining are steps in the right direction, but progress has been slow;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the need for a more flexible wages structure which better relates pay to skill and provides incentives for skill formation;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the need to reduce the number of unions with which firms must negotiate to streamline work practices;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.that labour market regulation has been increased&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>not decreased&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.that income support incentives need to be examined . . . </PARA>
<PARA>These are just some among a number of initiatives that the OECD will consider in its report on Australia later this year. The minute advised the minister that, whatever approach he decided to take in order to deal with the OECD so that it came to heel to the ACTU's limited view of what our industrial relations system is like&mdash;not the view of ordinary men and women in the working places of Australia, but the view of the Labor bureaucrats:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there are a number of downside risks for the Australian Government:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the OECD report is likely to be critical of the speed of progress towards enterprise bargaining, and to give only restrained credit to the role of the Accord process as a facilitator for change.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the ACTU objected to. It has a view that the accord process has been manna from heaven for the industrial relations system in this country, not the impediment to progress which all of us in the real world know that it has been. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is a danger that other labour market policies will also be criticised.</PARA>
<PARA>The OECD may not take as fanciful and as positive a view of our labour market as does the ACTU and also, obviously, as does the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, who is a former President of the ACTU and now a member of the executive government in Australia. The point is that we have had report after report after report that criticises our industrial relations system. The government's own green paper, issued not more than three months ago, leading to the white paper on unemployment&mdash;not employment&mdash;criticised the pace of reform and said that Australia was lagging behind and we needed to free up the labour market to give industry and business a chance to employ people. That is what it is all about; that is why we want industry&mdash;we want employment for Australians in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Rarely has a minister heading a department got everybody so offside as has the present Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton). He has antagonised everyone with his latest industrial relations bill, barely two months old as it is. The unions are offside with it. The employers are offside with it. Already the ACCI has been to Geneva to protest to the ILO. The states are offside. We have Victoria and New South Wales, at least, with a High Court challenge. We even have caucus brawling over the proposed changes that it will have to make to this bill. At a time when we have 900,000 people in this country unemployed, including in excess of 300,000 long-term unemployed, with interest rates about to start edging up again between two per cent and four per cent over the next 18 months, we have this mess in this area that should be travelling smoothly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area of enterprise flexibility agreements is a classic case of where this government has botched things. We had the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), quite some time ago now, saying that by mid-1993&mdash;that is, last year&mdash;over 50 per cent of federal workers would be covered by an enterprise flexibility agreement. The situation today is that we have had only one EFA ratified by the Industrial Relations Commission. We have had only four applications before it. The three others have been stalled. The one that has been ratified, IOF Modular Offices, a small furniture manufacturing company in the ACT with about 20 employees, even had its enterprise flexibility agreement modified. It has now become a part-unionised site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other three was the WA Engineering Co. The union went in there and argued technicalities about the awards. That has been put on ice. Another one, Able Demolitions, which is a demolition contractor in Victoria, wanted an EFA without unions, although it was unionised. It is now in limbo because of industrial trouble with the building unions. The other one that went forward for consideration was an aluminium manufacturing site in Queensland. It wanted an EFA. The unions went in there. Now 25 per cent of the workers are unionised. Not only has this dismayed the employer; the site does not have its enterprise flexibility agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This provision whereby the unions can come in and look over the shoulders of the employers and mess up things is being demonstrated only too graphically in Australia today. The minister has to make changes in this area&mdash;not just in the area of unfair dismissals&mdash;if we are going to get proper enterprise agreements in this country. All it is doing is driving employers into other areas. They are setting up individual contracts with their workers. A classic case of this is CRA, the mining giant. On its site in the Pilbara iron ore fields in Western Australia, so far 1,400 have signed individual contracts with their employer to exclude the unions. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The expenditure as a whole for 1993-94 will be $180 million for the environment, $115 million for meteorology and $59 million-odd for the Antarctic, which I found a pretty amazing figure. Let us say, however, that it is appropriate. What then becomes amazing is that it is a third of the total expenditure on the environment&mdash;that is, leaving out expenditure on Landcare, which comes under another departmental heading. So we are spending $7 billion-odd on social welfare and $180 million in the whole of the mainland of Australia on the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fairly obvious that we do not have much time, so I will deal with three areas only. The first one is the Daintree rescue package, which hinges on a matching dollar for dollar commitment by the Queensland Government. It was a three-year program, it was about cooperative management agreements, it was about selective purchase of privately owned blocks and it was about the declaration of nature refuges, but no money has been budgeted by Queensland. So it looks as though this item has failed before it has commenced. I notice that in the Senate today the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, said he was looking at a new program on tree planting&mdash;another program that has not been implemented&mdash;with Ministers Crean and Collins, so obviously Queensland is being rather difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the subject of the national river health program, an amount of $10 million was allocated in December 1992 by the Prime Minister and set out to be expended, we all thought, this year&mdash;in the budget of last year, the current year. Suddenly, on Environment Day, there was an announcement that $6 million of that $10 million would be spent on the health of the river system in Australia and the other $4 million had not yet been allocated. Those are big programs, but of course they have not been implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased to see the accelerated drainage proposals for the Murchison-Echuca basin&mdash;an allocation of $6.2 million over three years&mdash;and for the Sunraysia&mdash;an allocation of $2.5 million over the same period. However, I believe that the environment area of this budget is like so many of the things that have happened in this area over the last few years&mdash;plenty of announcements, plenty of lead times, plenty of putting back the programs and a lot of failure. If we look at the individual areas within the environment portfolio and at the lack of success of the various Ministers, we find quite quickly that for much of this program it is simply a matter of eking out the expenditure, topping up a little bit here and there and trying to, if you like, deal with a matter that has been far too complicated for this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this government has been very successful at making glamorous noises about the environment but, in every area that you care to take in the corrective sense&mdash;that is, correcting the damage that we have done in the last 200 years&mdash;I think there is absolutely no doubt that this government has been a failure. You can see, as you go through the financial amounts, the dollar amounts that come out, that there is a dollar here and a dollar there, always late&mdash;in many cases it is simply to set up management plans&mdash;and very little of the money gets through. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

But many shadow ministers who come into this place thinking that they are doing the right thing by showing an interest in what is happening in the portfolio area that they have taken over control for the coalition parties often dispute the adequacy of the amount of moneys that are so allocated. I find that all very interesting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition went to the last election very much on the basis that government outlays were to be reduced, slashed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not dispute that the honourable member for Barker does understand the need for this government to be involved in rehabilitation of the environment. I take what he says tonight as being a true indication of the direction that he is coming from, but then he went on to talk about the need for additional funding, or disputed the amount of funding that is put up. It is time that the coalition indicated where it would go for additional funding or what other aspects of government enterprise or government outlays it would reduce to enable that to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps it is time, within the Australian community, to look at the funding of our environmental programs. To do that might require our looking at some alternative sources of funding. Of course, this budget does not go to that. But what I propose tonight in the context of the comments that have been made is this: let us have that debate; let us decide whether we can get a consensus of agreement across this chamber on some of the proposals that are often thrown up, which would increase the income available and which could then be targeted to increase funding in a number of the areas where this budget already allocates money. </PARA>

The fact that the responsibility for those wetlands is under that convention is again an interesting quirk of the federal system that we have because the wetlands rest within the control of the states and territories. The Commonwealth government is the signatory to the convention and is obliged to try to, through its role, organise our efforts, and it requires this cooperative effort. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring to the attention of honourable members the existence of an exciting initiative with respect to environmentally sustainable energy technology. There are also important implications for regional development. As members would be aware, Australian companies are beginning to seriously address the opportunities arising in the renewable energy sector. In the past, the low price of abundant energy in Australia has tended to restrain development of renewable energy industries as there has not obviously been the incentive to invest in these industries. Of course, solar energy is a proud exception to this rule, and the lucky combination of plenty of sun, long distances, remote communities and world-class scientists has seen some stunning Australian achievements and innovations in this field.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As governments, industry and the electorate at large continue to focus on environmental issues, this increased scrutiny is driving technological advances which improve renewable energy technologies. These improvements in performance reduce the cost differential between renewable and fossil fuel energy technologies. At the same time, more innovative solutions to meet energy supply requirements are being considered, and governments are being forced to confront the different regulatory and planning implications of these solutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the foreseeable future, renewable energy systems cannot nearly replace fossil fuel technologies for reasons of cost and practicalities, but an important niche market is developing which I strongly encourage Australian business to examine and enter. A case in point is biomass power generation. In this context, the term `biomass' refers to wood and wood waste, sugar cane residue, cotton waste, rice hulls, food crop residues and municipal waste. The process of gasification of this fuel produces a variety of combustible gases which can be used to produce electricity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the possibility for cogeneration at these sites; that is, producing electricity and using the waste heat to drive an additional industrial process. This could be the kiln drying of hardwood for furniture uses or growing vegetables out of season in a hothouse.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Due to the abundant supplies of suitable fuel available, biomass is potentially the largest source of renewable energy after hydro-electricity. In the United States, almost half of the country's renewable energy sources are based on biomass technologies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see that an Australian company is grasping the opportunity presented by biomass power generation to position itself firmly in the global market for this technology. The company is Treelectric Gasification Systems, based in New South Wales. This company has the rights to a new process to produce combustible gases from biomass. The technology involved is a significant improvement on past attempts to harness this resource. In fact, there are strong indications that this process will provide commercially viable energy generation, particularly at remote sites, wherever a suitable quantity of feed stock is available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Considerable interest in this process has already been shown by high profile companies, and I am pleased to note that Treelectric is focused on export opportunities to win itself a place in this niche market worldwide. The company has exactly the sort of dynamic, soundly based approach to developing innovative energy technologies which is required at this stage of the industry's development. In pursuing its market the company has been at pains to point out the implications of the project for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting regional development, which I am sure will be of interest to all members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the development of the national electricity grid is obviously essential and will have many valuable benefits for Australians, there is no doubt that small-scale power generators using local materials are the way of the future for remote or relatively isolated areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the United States over 1,000 rural electrical cooperatives form a vast network across the continent. These cooperatives are very active in the local community and serve as a focus for regional development. This involves encouraging business development but also helping the community with individual housing and social needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this way, the electricity cooperative pulls the community together and can develop the potential of the whole community. The result is something akin to a combination of a shire council and a chamber of commerce, but on a smaller scale. This means the focus of activity is proudly local and not diffused over a wide area, as sometimes may occur with the boundaries of shire councils. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The link holding the cooperatives together is simply that they belong to the community and serve the community's needs accordingly. This would be a welcome development in any community, and I look forward to the day when companies such as Treelectric have provided the critical energy technology to enhance the viability of such schemes in Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

It may surprise the honourable member for Gippsland but I too have in parts of my electorate organisations which are similarly working towards not the same thing as the honourable member for Gippsland has raised here tonight, quite correctly, but a hydro-power type arrangement also very suitable for small communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that most of the proposals for these types of energy generation schemes are somewhat lost in the thrust to sell them as suitable schemes in many overseas markets. This is regrettable, in the sense that there needs to be a sea change not just within this House&mdash;I recognise members see this&mdash;but within the Australian community in general. Some of these smaller locally established energy projects can work within many parts of Australia. I know there are one or two that already do that, but I still think the general acceptance is that these smaller locally orientated energy projects are appropriate for the developing countries rather than for a developed country to latch onto. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Rainbow Power Co, which operates out of Nimbin, has developed a very efficient hydro-pulse generator with an adaptor to change direct current to AC.

I know there is a general movement towards incorporating localised power schemes and generation schemes right across Australia. Be that as it may, there should be a greater awareness of the possibility of moving away from the large power schemes, the larger hydro-electric or coal-fired power stations, to having more of them being incorporated. While we are slowly moving towards that in our policies, there could be a greater and a faster shift. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I wish to raise the issue of the move towards the national standards for the environment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I studied the budget documents, I looked without much joy for the very effective community cultural, recreation and sporting grants program. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may recall the program as the infamous sports rorts program. You will recall that the House was presented with a report from the Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts which unanimously backed the intent of the program and the wish for it to continue. But, alas, this was not to be the case and this very effective program has been jettisoned from the history of parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a shame because the program was supported by both sides of the House and it was only the incompetence of the minister concerned&mdash;which lead her to resign in disgrace early this year&mdash;that has brought disrepute to this particular program. So the claims of pork-barrelling during the investigation may seem well founded, for, if the party of rhetoric were true to its values and wished to help the rapidly growing suburbs of our nation, it would have continued this program. But according to the budget papers, it has not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own electorate of Cowan suburbs like Marangaroo, Alexander Heights and Ballajura are fine examples of community motivated residents wishing to develop facilities for their own suburbs. It is truly a tragedy that the former member for Cowan ignored the importance of the principles of this fine program and made few representations to her own minister. An examination of records indicates a very low application rate, notwithstanding the very high amount of local groups within my area of Cowan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, it would probably not surprise you to know that the Cowan electorate prior to the last election did not receive any funding at all in the last round of funding for this particular program&mdash;a terrible slight upon the former member for Cowan. The electorate of Cowan is rapidly expanding and it comprises young families who struggle with poor or no recreational facilities. I have a meeting later this week with senior citizens, play groups and community groups to discuss this matter and their needs, which have grown too great for facilities built some 18 months ago by the state government. These young families require the quality of life their parents had and they are being discriminated against compared with other suburbs closer to the city which were established some years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The party of rhetoric, the Labor Party&mdash;the party proclaiming social justice&mdash;is really being seen in the cynical way it should be: a party that cares about only one thing, and that is the trappings of power and holding on to it. I encourage the members opposite, especially those in the chamber at the moment, to lobby the appropriate minister and to seek the re-establishment of the funding of this particular program. Perhaps, cynically, I could suggest that the government bring on an early election so that we may see the re-introduction of another program similar in its generosity yet much better managed than the whiteboard management of the previous minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we need in the fast growing communities is facilities that promote community spirit. Funding of such programs is the answer to these needs, and I ask the government to reconsider its approach to such needs. Continually ignoring new communities will not go unnoticed by those who live there and they will, I am sure, reflect their thoughts in the ballot box at the next election when they will be demanding greater representation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to the reconsideration of this particular funding program by the government. The greatness of our nation is shown not so much by the takers in our community as by the makers. This program really promotes that sort of concept. I encourage those opposite to speak to their minister and perhaps bring forward this particular program at the next budget. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I have returned to have a second go to speak on the community cultural recreation and sporting facilities program. The honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) has caused me a problem in that I do not want my comments to be taken as being in support of what he said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, I dissociate myself from his rhetoric about the former member for Cowan, the minister and a few others that he mentioned. I came into the chamber to express my disappointment that that program was, I think, a glaring omission from this year's budget. In any consideration of a future program of that ilk the Commonwealth should step back and reassess the areas in which it is best suited to have an involvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the parliament before last the Banking, Finance and Public Administration Committee undertook a couple of inquiries into sports funding. One of the recommendations put to government was that the Commonwealth government naturally had a role in the funding of sport at an elite level. I do not think there is a great deal of dispute about that. There may be an ongoing discussion about the balance between the funding for elite sports levels and the funding at other levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A suggestion contained in one of the committee's reports was the precursor to the program that the honourable member for Cowan has mentioned. I think it may have been envisaged by the committee that these projects should be more of a regional nature. It is a matter of trying to provide worthwhile community projects, but providing them at a level that is appropriate for Commonwealth involvement. I could give an example of the city of Whittlesea in my region. That city has put together an international athletics track. The funding for that work was under the local government capital works program out of One Nation. That municipality for the northern suburbs of Melbourne has put together an athletics facility that is quite a number of notches above what is just required by the local community. The Commonwealth could perhaps rethink the overall program and look at providing facilities at that level. I know it would be difficult to make definitions about the type of facility that the Commonwealth should be involved in. But we have this breathing space. There seems to be agreement across the chamber that the program was worthwhile. The debate should be seen as a bit more than a lobbying exercise. We have a chance to have a rethink about the nature of that program. I am on the record on a number of occasions as saying that I thought that that program was quite worth while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter I just want to briefly touch upon&mdash;I am not sure whether it is the light or the clock that is going to beat me&mdash;is the funding towards the Omega navigation station. I suppose I am of a generation that is quite intrigued to be coming into this place to speak on the merit of retaining an interest in Omega. During my university days it seemed to be one of those objects of protest because it had connotations of our unholy alliance with the United States government, but I am pleased that it now has a more peaceful operation through supporting our meteorological bureau and in giving worthwhile advice, especially to the smaller nations of our region.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. In addressing these estimates, I simply want to make some brief observations about the immigration program which was a major aspect of the commentary that was given in relation to the same estimates in another place. But I want to observe that it is always of great disappointment to me that in the Senate our colleagues have the opportunity, through the estimate committee system, to be able to devote a good deal of time to examining the way in which public funds are to be spent and to test matters of accountability. In this place we are limited to a mere five minutes. In the context of the size of the program and the large range of issues that ought to be covered, it is extraordinarily disappointing to me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to take up a number of points that were addressed in the Senate. One of the first matters raised was in relation to the disabled people's international conference to be held this year. But in the context of the discussion that was taking place, reference was made to health criteria and their application to people who might be entering Australia as visitors, as well as those who enter Australia permanently. It brought to light a point which I find considerably embarrassing&mdash;and I imagine that the government ought to find embarrassing&mdash;that the report of the House of Representatives committee in relation to health criteria in particular is still outstanding. I find it extraordinary that a report of such major consequence, which could lend considerable assistance to the government in dealing with a large number of difficult issues, remains outstanding, particularly as the chairman of the committee who dealt with that matter is one of the government's parliamentary secretaries in one of the departments that ought to be in concert with the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs ensuring that this matter can be dealt with promptly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not the first time I have raised this matter, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Dr Theophanous) has been known to stand up in high dudgeon&mdash;and I might get a second chance to have a go at him today, which is different from what has been the case before&mdash;to defend the record. But I think it is quite indefensible. If the parliamentary secretary is responsible for the delay, in his guise in the Department of Human Services and Health, perhaps he can explain that. But it is also particularly important to me that the government is so ambivalent these days about its position on immigration. I remind the House that it was the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who, not so long ago, said that in this recovery the complement to skill formation in the labour market was not going to come from immigration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In past periods of labour demand, immigration has been seen as an important ancillary element of meeting that demand, complementary to training, but the government seems to be abandoning this. One of the things that came out that was particularly important to me were the admissions in the Senate that we are now seeing a deterioration in the skill level of the migration program. I think it is particularly germane, at a time when the government is claiming that it is increasing skilled migration, that we have admissions on the record from departmental officials that there will be a lowering of the skilled intake. If the officials are looking for that, Mr McMahon might assist. I am referring to page 42. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is humane when one looks at the government's program which is predicated upon skilled immigration increasing, largely because of the accommodation of the 1 November onshore arrivals in the skilled intake&mdash;a total of 8,300 additional persons. The interesting aspect about those people is that the skill comes from the fact that, whether they were skilled or not, they have been allowed to engage in some employment in the time that they have been in Australia. But, obviously, they are not people who are enhancing the skill level of our immigration program. There are many aspects I would like to discuss but with this outrageous program it is not possible. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Initially, I would like to put on record my commendation of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs for the increased numbers of aid grants that will affect a large number of electorates like mine. An additional vote of $1.25 million will fund 25 of these grants around Australia. Already, as a recipient of a large number of new arrivals from non-English speaking backgrounds, my electorate has a significant number of these grants. That trend is strengthened by the presence of a number of departmental flats in North Auburn. It is a commendable decision to increase this program to ensure that the settlement needs of a large number of the community are met.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additionally, the vote of three-quarters of a million dollars in grants to the humanitarian area focuses on the reality that a number of the groups from which we are receiving people under this program are not those that conventionally have large numbers within Australia; they have no structures already in place, and they do not have large-scale communities with those kinds of support mechanisms. On both fronts the total vote of around $2 million will be very beneficial in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to hear the evidence of the Bosnian Foreign Minister who appeared before the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. He talked of the suffering in his country. There are 933,000 displaced persons within Bosnia and the number of displaced persons outside the area of the Former Republic of Yugoslavia is 1 1/4 million. This is relevant to my electorate because Bosnians have been a particular growth group coming into the electorate under the humanitarian program. The dimensions of the problem in the former Yugoslavia have been seen locally. Over the next four years $5.2 million will be allocated towards the mental health problems of those people who have suffered trauma and torture. That allocation is relevant to that particular part of the world. The government has been criticised for its failure to move on with mental health, but this allocation fits into the government's broad agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue involved in the broad migration intake concerns refugees and the question of how long they have to be here to qualify for the age pension, et cetera. There is  recognition that people under the refugee classification do not come here freely; they do not come here because cars are cheaper or social security benefits are higher; they just come here and, in those cases that are eventually found to be refugees, they do so to avoid suffering. So the government is to be commended on its agreement to abandon the current limitations and restrictions on when these persons receive benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to the humanitarian area, $.625 million is allocated to ensure better coordination of the delivery of government services for those people under humanitarian programs. This group lacks the structures of other groups. There might be efforts by the government to ensure equity in access to government facilities and to benefits but, to a large degree, these people have not been catered for by the government because of their previous non-presence in the community. This allocation ensures that they have more details about the actual facilities and, at the same time, ensures that they do not miss out on obvious benefits in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I commend the retention of a reasonable level of funding for migrant resource centres. There was concern in the last budget that there was a running down in the amount of money they had. Some of them were seemingly finding it very difficult to survive. They are vital to the provision of services to smaller communities, those that cannot receive funded grants or aid in their own right, and whilst there are none in my immediate electorate, in the western region there are a number that are fulfilling a vital need. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have spoken a number of times today on particular budget estimates. I did not have the time to comment earlier but, as this is being broadcast, it is the ideal time for me to say that it is a disgrace that, even though we are debating budget estimates today, we are allowed only five minutes to speak about such issues. It is not really for people like me on this side of parliament to stand up and complain about it, but to those who are at home listening to the broadcast, I say, `If you want responsibility in government, if you want responsibility in your politicians, rather than be cynical towards them, you should be demanding more from your local politicians and ensuring that they represent you to the best of their abilities.'</PARA></TALK.START>

I would like to take this opportunity to bring to the attention of this House the continuing concerns of local Vietnamese residents about overseas families and friends still resident in Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's immigration policy must reflect a number of criteria determined by the Australian community through the process of government. In addition to the very worthy goal of uniting families, one of the most important aspects of our immigration policy must be to provide a safe haven for people who face victimisation and persecution in their native countries. At present Australia is home to about 130,000 Vietnamese, many of whom have taken refuge here from the brutal and uncompromising regime of the socialist government in Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to use this opportunity to reiterate in the strongest possible terms my call on the Australian government to do more to end the continual and well-documented abuses of human rights in Vietnam. In addition to this, I strongly urge the government to do more to reunite the families of the Australian Vietnamese community with families still residing in Vietnam. In the years from 1991 to 1993, Australia allowed approximately 3,400 Vietnamese residents to enter Australia under its refugee, humanitarian and special assistance programs. These people are part of the 14,800 Vietnamese residents who have taken up permanent residency in Australia over the years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a recent question on notice I requested the government to pursue the Vietnamese government over its continued abuse of human rights in Vietnam, to ensure the freedom of numerous political prisoners presently being held in Vietnam and to ensure that at the very highest levels of government Australia would not compromise in its efforts with regard to human rights in Vietnam. In response to these questions I was informed that yes, the government would continue to pursue these interests. But I am asking the government to do more, much more, and to be more active in doing more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I receive many letters from local Vietnamese residents and organisations who tell tales of torment and torture by the Vietnamese government. Many, however, also offer strong advice to the government on its balance of economic and human rights issues, stressing a very prudent approach to the issues and stating that our regional stability depends heavily on the political and economic development of countries in the region, particularly Vietnam. Australia's immigration policy should always recognise the troublesome political climate facing our regional neighbours, in particular the abusive nature of regimes like that in Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Vietnamese community throughout Australia, particularly in Western Australia, has made a constructive contribution to Australia's ethnic diversity. Where possible it has adopted Australia warmly while preserving its cultural heritage and identity. I would like to bring to the attention of the House Dr Van Phat Nguyen, a resident in my own electorate, who recently stood for the local council and performed very well. Unfortunately, he did not get elected, but it goes to show that the Vietnamese community is beginning to take a stronger interest in the Australian community and is adding a lot of colour to our multicultural attitudes. In conclusion, I would encourage the government to further hasten its activity regarding immigration from Vietnam in order to facilitate the reunification of families of Vietnamese origin in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to make some further observations in relation to the immigration estimates, particularly to develop some of the arguments that I raised before about the nature of the immigration program. I adverted to the fact that the skill level was falling. The honourable member who spoke before me, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), mentioned that one of the reasons for the significant increase in the program this year has been that the government is now starting to bring into the program numbers of people who had, to all intents and purposes, been in Australia before; that is, the large number, in the main, of PRC nationals who came here as ostensibly bona fide students and stayed on after the Tiananmen Square massacre in circumstances in which we all recognise there was a need to be of assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But as the matter went on for a long period without resolution, and with continued arrivals in Australia of family members, we have had people here who have, as the government has admitted in Senate estimates hearings, been taking positions of employment. They are working part time and are now being accommodated within the program. They have distorted the program; they have done so significantly in relation to the program that the government is putting in place now. This has led to a situation in which the skill level is falling. As was also admitted in another place, the impact will be quite long term. The figures submitted by the deputy secretary of the department in terms of chain migration show from records of admissions that additional places number in the order of 70,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a significant matter, particularly when we consider that the program this year will have an increase from 34,000 to 36,500 in the preferential family stream. One of the things that worries me and obviously worries Senator McKiernan, who addressed the Senate estimates committees, is the extent to which the government does effectively test the bona fides of many of those people who access Australia through the preferential family stream.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the final comment is as opportunistic as one could get. To say that because there is a riot by a group of people dissatisfied with a government policy&mdash;in this case, with regard to the designation of people in Australia and the recognition of Macedonia&mdash;the minister or the government is responsible is inane. It could have been about any decisions. To say that in some way we should be over-concerned that people carry on in this way and that the government merits criticism for it is rather ridiculous. If it were about another subject matter, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) and those opposite would be screaming about the need for police action, new legislation, gaol sentences, et cetera. So to come here today and say that the government should be subjected to criticism because of the carry on in that particular situation is, as I say, fairly inane.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other aspects of the budget is the $3 1/4 million in the short term and the nearly half a million dollars over each of the next three years to increase respect for, knowledge of and interest in citizenship, and to lift its take-up levels. That is the subject of a current parliamentary inquiry. I think all of us would hope that we can find the reasons why some particular communities have a very low citizenship take-up level. A lot of the reasons why traditionally that was the case have been now overtaken by history and that is another area where the government should be commended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, I think the government should look at moving towards some manner in which citizenship can be tied to enrolment in this country. I take the opportunity to criticise the cut-backs in overtime over the last few years in the Australian Electoral Office. They have led to a situation where I would be surprised if half the people go home after citizenship functions and fill out those forms. Something has to be looked at to perhaps tie becoming a citizen to becoming enrolled at the same time. That should be taken on board in the broader inquiry. At the same time, I congratulate the government for doing something about lifting the profile of citizenship and encouraging more people to take it up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The MRCs, as I mentioned earlier, have maintained their funding, despite concerns when the last budget was announced. The government has given them the opportunity to be involved in NEIS labour markets and the small business sector in being sponsor bodies to come up with projects in that area. I think we are quite aware that this is inter-related with the lack of employment in a number of non-English speaking communities. The fact that some of these MRCs and other groups can come forward with proposals and thereby increase employment in what are really black spots in Australia's overall employment profile, is also a matter we should congratulate them on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, if there were any legitimate broad criticisms of the AMEP we would not be faced with the situation where all the complaints stem from one state. There is no real pattern of national concern with cut-backs in this area. It is, to some degree, a reflection of the administrative structure in the New South Wales system and perhaps the industrial skills of teachers in that field in making this an issue in one state alone. Any cut-backs in that area have to be seen in the wider context of the money that is going into English language skills for those people who have been here for decades and have had jobs, and who are now condemned to possible long-term unemployment because they lacked English skills when they were not really seen as a prerequisite. The government is actively increasing expenditure in that area. There has been a significant uplift. It has been maintained in this budget and to come along and quibble about what is specifically an AMEP is really losing sight of the main situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The parliament is debating tonight Appropriation Bill (No. 2) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill. Both of these bills are quite important to us. Jointly with the Appropriation Bill (No. 1), they appropriate moneys to fund the operation of government. Accordingly, I propose to deal with each of these bills individually. I also foreshadow that, on behalf of the coalition, I will move an amendment to Appropriation Bill (No. 2) during this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Appropriation Bill (No. 2) is a routine bill which is debated by the House every year as part of the normal budget process. The bill allocates $5 billion for certain capital purposes, including the construction of public works and buildings, the acquisition of sites and buildings, and the purchase of plant and equipment. In addition, funds are appropriated for grants to the states and territories, for certain loans and advances to government bodies, and for new policy measures where the legislation authorising expenditure on those measures has not yet been enacted. Included in this latter category are measures announced in the government's most recent mini-statement, Working Nation. A more expansive list of the purposes for which the money is appropriated is contained in schedules 1 and 2 of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Human Services and Health is the largest recipient of funds with a total appropriation of $1.4 billion. Grants to the states and territories for health services comprise most of the department's allocation. For example, $139 million has been given for the provision of general medical services, while $225 million is to be directed towards assistance for people with disabilities. The amount of $38 million is allocated to reduce waiting lists for elective surgery. With waiting lists of over 100,000 people, this amount will go only a very small way towards alleviating the pain of those who are on waiting lists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Communications and the Arts will receive $336 million in appropriations under this bill. The majority of these funds will be given to the Telstra Corporation as equity contributions. However, $61 million is allocated for the installation of radio and television transmitters, ancillary buildings and other equipment for national broadcasting. Interestingly, a figure of $2 million has been set aside for the Australia Festival in Washington. This seems to be rather a large amount for a festival and is, I presume, over and above the normal funding directed to our embassy in Washington. Exactly how this money will be spent and whether any benefit accrues from it deserves further scrutiny. Other purposes for which the appropriations are allocated include $81 million for new computers in the Department of Employment, Education and Training; $22 million for the construction of a new building for the Australian Geological Survey Organisation; $82 million for new labour market programs; and $78 million for new computer equipment in the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another measure which is to receive funds from this bill is the Aboriginal land acquisition fund. By way of background, the Aboriginal land acquisition fund was established as part of the government's response to the High Court's Mabo decision. A total of $1 billion will be paid into the fund over 10 years for land purchases by Aborigines who have been dispossessed of their land but who do not gain any benefit from the High Court's native title decision. According to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;and I caution the House not to place too much emphasis on this, given the Prime Minister's tendency to say one thing and do another&mdash;the land fund is to enable indigenous people to acquire land and manage it in a sustainable way. The land is to provide economic, social and cultural benefits for future indigenous generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1994-95 budget provides the first allocation to the fund of $200 million, which is provided for in this bill. This initial funding is to be followed by an annual appropriation of $124 million for the next nine years which will be maintained in real terms. The amount of $21.6 million of the allocation represents current ATSIC allocations for land acquisition and management, the responsibility for which will be transferred to the land fund from 1995-96. Funds in the land fund not used to purchase land will be invested so as to provide a capital base which will ensure that the fund becomes self-financing and operates independently of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is opposed to the establishment of the Aboriginal land acquisition fund for a number of very good and sound reasons. The first reason is that nowhere has the government demonstrated that the land fund will have any significant impact on the wellbeing of indigenous Australians. There are many pressing problems confronting the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, particularly those situated in the outback regions. Poor housing, education and health services are but three. In addition, there are a number of problems unique to these communities, including a lack of infrastructure, poor economic development and a lack of understanding of the indigenous culture. This fund will do nothing to address these problems.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In no way will it provide a better standard of living for the indigenous people living in these communities. In the same way, it will not encourage these communities to develop their culture or become self-supporting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason for the coalition's opposition is that the land fund simply duplicates other mechanisms which will do the same thing but which are already in place. The procedure which enables the purchase of land already exists at the state level. In addition, there is a facility available through ATSIC whereby Aboriginal people can be given land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the coalition, I question the need to establish yet another bureaucracy to do something which could quite easily be achieved using existing resources. The government's land fund represents a cynical attempt by the government to buy off yet another interest group. We have already seen it do this with environmental lobby groups, the sporting fraternity and women. Now it has targeted the Aboriginal community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the coalition does not believe that simply granting land will help the Aboriginal communities. It has not worked in the past and the government has not demonstrated how or why this proposal will be any different. Overall, the coalition believes that this money could be better spent to help Aboriginal communities overcome their more pressing problems in areas such as health, housing, education and unemployment. Accordingly, I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: "whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House expresses its opposition to the Government's decision to establish and allocate funds to the Aboriginal Land Fund and calls on the Government to direct more adequate funding towards aboriginal health, housing and education, and other social needs".</PARA>
<PARA>As I pointed out earlier, the funds appropriated by this bill total just over $5 billion. This is slightly lower than the appropriation sought in 1993-94, which was in the order of $5.2 billion. The fact that the appropriation sought has reduced is hardly a source of pride to this government. Indeed, given the size of the reduction it is largely irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is that we still have a budget deficit and this government is still in debt&mdash;indeed, heavily in debt. The government still has to borrow to finance its programs and its inefficient administration. Over the course of this year the government will borrow nearly $21 billion to fund its activities. This represents a slight increase on last year's borrowings, which were forecast to be $21.9 billion but will actually come in at around $19 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the 1994-95 borrowings $11.7 billion will be used to fund the budget deficit, $6.2 billion will be spent to redeem maturing treasury bonds, $104 million will redeem Australian savings bonds, $1.2 billion will be spent on maturities and possibly early calls of foreign currency debt and $1.1 billion will go on net payments associated with Commonwealth public trading enterprises superannuation. The government will fund the debt it will accumulate in 1994-95 through a further issue of treasury bonds, estimated to be worth $17 billion, treasury notes and treasury indexed bonds. This will add to existing Commonwealth government debt, which currently stands at $91 billion. This is up a massive 18.6 per cent on the $76.5 billion that the government had already raked up by the end of June 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the budget papers, Commonwealth debt will continue to rise, reaching an expected $104 billion in 1995. To put it into perspective, Commonwealth government debt equates to nearly 23 per cent of GDP, or one quarter of everything we produce. Not only is the level of government debt alarming; so too are the massive repayments which we, the taxpayers, are forced to make every year. The cost of servicing the Commonwealth debt&mdash;that is, the cost of interest payments&mdash;will soar by 22 per cent in 1994-95. Repayments will rise from $6.6 billion in 1993-94 to $8.4 billion in 1994-95. But it does not stop there&mdash;interest payments on public debt will be over $10 billion in 1997-98 based on our current debt levels. Put another way, interest payments currently amount to seven per cent of total Commonwealth spending&mdash;up from 5.7 per cent in 1993-94. This is more than the government spends on housing, industry assistance, science and research, labour market programs or culture and recreation. It is a only marginally less than that spent on defence and education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bear in mind that I am only talking about interest payments; the figures I have quoted do not begin to make an inroad into reducing the principal. Also bear in mind that they relate to current debt only. We can be sure that debt will continue to rise under this government as it continues to run up budget deficits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's massive government debt typifies the problem with Labor's approach to government. Rather than using borrowings as a means of finance as a last resort, this government is content to leave the hard decisions and use borrowings as a primary source of funds. It is happy to spend and buy its way into office, but without taking the responsibility that goes with it. It simply puts all its promises on Bankcard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you or I, or anyone else in the community for that matter, ran our household or business in the same way as the government does, we would be broke. Our bank manager</PARA>
<PARA>would not keep giving us the money. Rather, any normal person or business in this position would be told to go and review its budget and look at ways of reining in expenditure. But not this government. It has no intention of tightening its belt. It has no intention of tackling the large and cumbersome bureaucracy, of stamping out problems in program administration or undertaking the multitude of other reforms that should be put in place. Rather, it seems content to leave a legacy of massive and spiralling debt to the future generations of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has long been concerned about this approach. We have been seen as slash and burn merchants, but that is not our approach to this particular problem. We say that the economy could be better managed and this government is not a very good economic manager. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned earlier the $2 million allocated in the appropriation bill for the Australia Festival in Washington. This should be looked at as a matter of urgency. Why do we need a festival in Washington? Do we get any trade benefits out of it? If so, it should be funded from the existing trade or Austrade budget. If it is that important, why does the embassy not fund the festival? These are all very important questions. Similarly, grants to trade unions should be scrapped. They are simply a payback to unions for the support they have given Labor and the Labor Party during election periods and as such are a blatant abuse of the taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overseas travel and domestic junkets for bureaucrats should be abolished. At the very least, travel should be curbed through more stringent scrutiny of the benefits that will accrue to the community from the particular trip. As a demonstration of the magnitude of such travel and indeed the potential for savings, officers of the Department of Industry, Technology and Science spent nearly $1 million on overseas travel in 1993-94. Office furnishings too should be subject to stricter rules. The Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development spent $1.6 million on furnishings and office equipment in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many areas where expenditure can be pruned without compromising the role of government. The resultant savings would reduce the burden on the taxpayer. And, make no mistake, it is the responsibility of any good government to ensure that it provides to the community the best service in the most cost-effective manner. As I said earlier, the coalition will not oppose Appropriation Bill (No. 2), however we have moved a second reading amendment formally expressing our opposition to the Aboriginal land fund, especially in light of the many other pressing social issues facing Aboriginal communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second bill before the House, the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1993-94, appropriates funds to meet the current and capital costs of running the parliament&mdash;$127 million has been appropriated for this purpose, up $1.1 million on the 1993-94 budget. Having said that, I should point out to the House that actual expenditure for 1993-94 will come in under budget at $123.9 million. The reduction comes largely from running costs being lower than expected. In the House of Representatives, for example, running costs for 1993-94 are in the order of $22 million, somewhat lower than the $22.5 million allocated. Similarly, running costs of the Joint House Department are nearly $2 million lower than budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that we are debating the management of this building, it is appropriate for me to make some comments on the recent Auditor-General's report on the Joint House Department. The Joint House Department is one of five departments which service the parliament and maintain the building. Specifically, the Joint House Department has responsibility for engineering and maintenance services of both the building and surrounding grounds; food and beverage services for members, senators and building occupants; cleaning and housekeeping; and public relations activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The audit office expressed its concern about the economies of the Joint House Department's operations. While there was no obvious evidence of waste, the audit office noted that the Joint House Department has set very high service standards and that these carry considerable costs. It formed the view that this cost was growing and that perhaps it did not represent good value for money. Accordingly, the Auditor-General noted that there was scope for the Joint House Department to gain efficiencies in service delivery by reviewing the value for money side of its operations. The Auditor-General said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This does not mean compromising the quality of service delivery, but the Joint House Department should not discount options because they do not meet the current high standards the Department operates within.</PARA>
<PARA>The audit office also expressed concern about the gardening and landscaping role of the Joint House Department. Specifically, it noted that the Joint House Department has not considered alternatives, such as providing the service in-house. In effect, the Auditor-General is saying that the Joint House Department should give consideration to contracting out some or all of the gardening services. At the very least, investigation of this option would give the Joint House Department some criteria against which to measure its own costs and benchmark its gardening services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In making these comments, the Auditor-General has implied that the current means of managing the gardens is not the most effective or cost efficient. It is the responsibility of the Joint House Department and, through it, the Presiding Officers to ensure that taxpayers gain value for money. Costs incurred in maintaining this building must be as low as possible while at the same time ensuring that the building be maintained in an appropriate manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sorts of measures being advocated by the Auditor-General would result in some savings to taxpayers without compromising the operations of the building or the level of service provided to the occupants. Accordingly, I look forward to seeing their implementation reflected in a lower appropriation for the parliamentary departments in the 1995-96 financial year. Otherwise, the coalition does not oppose this bill. </PARA>

The issue involves the present situation of Aboriginal health, how money is desperately needed in that area and the consequence of money appropriated for the land fund.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to go into the history of what the government has been doing in this area. Earlier this year, we were subjected to one of the typical grandstanding efforts on Aboriginal health by the now departed&mdash;not from this world but from the other place&mdash;ex-Senator Graham Richardson. It was almost a reliving of the environment when we saw the senator out there&mdash;instead of with the Greens, the trees and everything else&mdash;with a group of Aboriginal people showing to the world, and to Australia in general, the state of their health. It was not a good picture with Graham Richardson in the middle saying, `This is the state of health of Aboriginal people in Australia and we should be ashamed.' He was quite right. We should be ashamed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ex-Senator then raised the hopes of Aboriginal communities. Having gained a lot of publicity with his trip to the outback, he then said he would be approaching the government and asking for $1 billion for Aboriginal health. The community, knowing the reputation of ex-Senator Richardson, thought that he might have a very good chance of obtaining that $1 billion. However, when his submission went to cabinet, he had reduced his request slightly to $800 million, which was still a considerable sum. Ex-Senator Richardson went with all the credibility he had and said that he would go to cabinet and obtain $800 million for Aboriginal health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, despite the declared commitment of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to raising the standard of Aboriginal health and the standard of Aboriginal communities generally in their infrastructure, this $800 million seems to have disappeared, along&mdash;it seems&mdash;with ex-Senator Richardson. When ex-Senator Richardson departed from the other place, the health portfolio fell to the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence). Here it becomes `curiouser and curiouser' because, although the honourable member admitted she had not got quite what ex-Senator Richardson had promised to Aboriginal communities, she did claim that she had done rather well in getting $500 million in new funds for Aboriginal health, specifically to go towards the national Aboriginal health strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we mean when we say we are going to put $500 million in new funds into a project? I think everybody understands it to mean that the project&mdash;the health strategy with all the health service workers, the doctors and the clinics&mdash;will go on as it is with $500 million in new funds. That is what the Aboriginal communities believed and, hearing the budget speech, I believe it is what this parliament believed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, when we look at how the funds have been allocated, we find that this is not the case at all. This $499 million is, in the vernacular, a take. Access Economics was so intrigued that it has produced a paper in which it has tried to follow what has happened with this funding. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry. The Minister for Administrative Services, who is at the table, made a comment and I did not understand its relevance. If he would like to repeat it, I might be able to reply. Access Economics tried to find out where this $500 million extra funding was, and found that it was very difficult. Finally, it did an analysis and, based on the current funding to the national Aboriginal health strategy, worked out that the funding this year was $70.1 million. If funding were to be continued at that rate for the next five years, this $500 million would become $414 million, which would be necessary simply for the continuation of the present programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what happened to our $499 million? It seems to have disappeared into the same program in which it always was. The difference is about $85 million, which is not very much. So much is the commitment of this government to Aboriginal health that it has perpetuated what I think could be described only as a con on the Aboriginal community. I would like to read from what Access Economics says, because I do not think I could put it any better myself:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Aboriginal Health Strategy . . . was to have expired in June 1995&mdash;the money stopped then.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a quote from the new Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), justifying what she had done in this Aboriginal health strategy. She was still claiming that it was new money. But to claim that this was new money she had to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Aboriginal Health Strategy . . . was to have expired in June 1995&mdash;the money stopped then.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now there's new money to keep it going.</PARA>
<PARA>Access Economics had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does this mean then, that save for the new Budget commitment, as at June 1995 all the people working in Aboriginal health would be sacked, that Aboriginal health services would be closed, that all works on water supplies, sanitation, housing, etc would cease and, perhaps, that Aboriginal people would no longer get sick? Obviously not.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on&mdash;and I do not think I could do much better than this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only point about the commitment is that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">it had not been previously announced</EMPHASIS> (at least in a budget context). Accordingly, there was no provision in the forward estimates of expenditure. These are facts, but facts of no consequence. The procedure of reannouncing existing programs as if they were new programs is a procedure of crying wolf. It is a procedure of budgetary illusion.</PARA>
<PARA>It is more than that; it is a procedure of misleading the Australian public and, worse than that, it is a procedure of misleading the Aboriginal community. I question the sincerity of the Minister for Human Services and Health in this matter. I can put it down to one of two things: either she was deliberately misleading the Australian public or she had been misled about what this funding meant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister does have an excuse: she is new in the job and perhaps she did not have a good idea of what was going on. But I say to the government that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) has no excuse. He is well aware of where money goes, yet he too put his name to a press release which claimed that this was new funding, and I believe that `new' in the press release was in italics. It has been revealed as no such thing, although we do acknowledge there has been a slight increase in the funding. So much for the integrity of this minister, who I believe prides himself on his integrity in this matter.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week the federal Race Discrimination Commissioner, Irene Moss, released a report called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Water: a report on the provision of water and sanitation in remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities</EMPHASIS>. That report reveals what is going on in these communities&mdash;an enormous waste of money. Infrastructure is put there that does not work. Sophisticated types of infrastructure are put in communities and are then not backed up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that the minister at the table is laughing. I hope he is laughing at something other than the breakdown of the infrastructure. He is not responsible for this portfolio. It is a general finance portfolio, so he could be excused for not knowing very much about it. I point out to him that this report found that 34 per cent of these remote Aboriginal communities did not have water quality that reached the standard of the NHMRC. That is really a condemnation of what has happened to these communities. It demonstrates the failure of this government to provide adequately for those communities. The report also found that 46 per cent of these communities would not have adequate water in the next six years. These are enormous problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go into the health problems of the Aboriginal communities because I think we all know what those problems are. Those problems are based very much on these public health measures. The great advances in human health did not come with the medicine and technology so much as it did with the changes in public health measures, the access to clean, pure water, the access to sanitation. These are the very things that are being denied those communities. The con that has occurred on the national Aboriginal health strategy is a tragedy. The majority of the money allocated to the strategy goes to providing infrastructure&mdash;environmental health infrastructure, water, sanitation and housing. Those are the fundamentals of living that these communities need if the health of the children is going to be protected.

<PARA>This bill is a machinery financing measure to enable certain defence expenditures to be met from the loan fund rather than from consolidated revenue and to supplement the moneys available to the consolidated revenue fund. Legally, expenditure from the consolidated revenue fund cannot exceed the moneys available to the fund. Successive governments have adopted the practice of introducing a loan bill to authorise the issue of moneys from the loan fund to meet expenditures that have been appropriated by the parliament, but for which insufficient funds are available in the consolidated revenue fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this bill is to make provision for the financing of the prospective deficit in the consolidated revenue fund. The budget deficit of $11.7 billion for 1994-95 gives rise to a prospective deficit in the consolidated revenue fund of about $18.9 billion. The difference between the two deficits arises because appropriations from that fund include various items which are functionally classified as financing transactions rather than outlays, and thus do not affect the budget outcome. These items include payments to the national debt sinking fund to redeem or repurchase Commonwealth securities and superannuation payments made by the Commonwealth on behalf of public trading enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides authority for the loan fund to meet defence expenditures incurred in 1994-95 after the passage of the bill that would otherwise have been met from the consolidated revenue fund and, if necessary, to supplement the consolidated revenue fund so that it can meet its other commitments. The bill also provides the authority to raise loans to cover these payments from the loan fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Except for loan raising expenses, which are currently estimated at $14.7 million for 1994-95, the bill does not authorise expenditures additional to those already approved by, or currently before, the parliament. I emphasise that the bill does not in any way impinge on the prerogative of the parliament to appropriate moneys, but simply provides the means to finance expenditures previously approved and appropriated by the parliament. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last 12 months the government has made a great deal of its deficit reduction program. It has a plan to reduce the budget deficit to less than one per cent of GDP by 1996-97 and it holds this up as an example of its commitment to responsible financial management. The government has set itself a moderate target, and it knows it&mdash;and the financial markets know it as well. Should the government achieve its deficit reduction target it will be quick to say that it said it could do it and it has delivered the goods; it has brought home the bacon, so to speak. But that is the way this government works. It ruins things and then pats itself on the back when it goes through an ill-conceived attempts to fix them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's dire long-term unemployment problem is a perfect example of this Labor government in action. Having created the problem through its use of monetary policy and having put one million people on the dole queues, this government has set about solving the problem and patting itself on the back for each failed attempt along the way. First, we had the One Nation statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;a good old pump priming exercise that is now held up as a model of ill-conceived government policy. It was never going to work and it never did, end of story. The Prime Minister's next attempt was the Investing in the Nation statement. The title of that document speaks for itself: Investing in the Nation failed to lift investment one iota. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course the most recent attempt, Working Nation, is not only the most grandiose but also the most desperate and foolish attempt to deal with the problem. The government's answer to the problem of massive, chronic, long-term unemployment is training programs and case management&mdash;no jobs, but case management. The Prime Minister would have us believe that Working Nation is Labor to its bootstraps. It is a statement to that effect, but it will quickly fail the test of time and be revealed as nothing more than $6.5 billion in ill-conceived government spending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget deficit this year is expected to be $13.6 billion or 3.2 per cent of GDP. In his budget speech the Treasurer (Mr Willis) was only too pleased to tell us that this is some $2.4 billion lower than the forecast in last year's budget. So what does it mean? The budget deficit is $13.6 billion. It is quite simple: this year the government is spending $13.6 billion more than it collected in taxes and other revenues. Total government spending is $114.5 billion, while total revenue is $100.9 billion. The difference between spending and revenue is the deficit; in other words, there is red ink all over the bottom line. But that was Mr Dawkins's effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has the new Treasurer proposed in his first budget? Do not let the dour delivery of the Treasurer fool you. There are some extraordinary forecasts in the budget. Let us start with the deficit. The Treasurer is pleased with his efforts here because he has the deficit down from $13.6 billion this year to $11.7 billion next year. This means that the budget deficit will fall from 3.2 per cent of GDP to 2.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How has the Treasurer achieved this? How has he got the deficit down? We might expect the government to embark on some fiscal restraint to bring the deficit down, but the Treasurer has delivered it another way. He has done it by increasing government spending by $6.1 billion next year and, while the revenue that the government collects will rise by almost $8 billion, the Treasurer's plan to get the deficit down is to spend more but collect even more than that in taxes. What a plan!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer has made a great deal of the fact that this first budget does not include any tax increases. He can only claim this because the tax increases that take effect in 1994-95 were announced in the previous budget. So, while there are no tax increases, the tax take for 1994-95 will rise from $94.2 billion to $103.3 billion. There are no new taxes, but we will all be paying an extra $9.2 billion in taxes next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By 1996-97 the government will be spending $131.6 billion and collecting some $126.8 billion in taxes and other revenue. The resulting deficit of $4.8 billion will achieve the government's aim of bringing the deficit down to less than one per cent of GDP. This plan really is quite extraordinary. To bring the deficit down, the government will increase spending by 3.1 per cent this year and 3.2 per cent next year, while increasing the tax grab by 5.6, 5.5 and 4.3 per cent in real terms over the next three years. To achieve this target, let us not forget that the government has thrown out the second round of tax cuts which was promised before the last election. These were tax cuts that were enshrined in law, l-a-w, by the Prime Minister. But the book fiddling does not stop there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has also had to embark on a new round of asset sales to fund its recurring expenditure. While many of these sales have been on the coalition's policy book for some time, the difference is that we would not use the proceeds of asset sales to fund ongoing expenses. We would ensure that the funds were used constructively to build a stronger economic structure. But this is another thing that the Labor government is not much interested in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While government spending is blowing out, none of it is going into productive investment in Australia's future. While the public sector investment in infrastructure accounted for 6.5 per cent of GDP in 1984-85, the government has run it down to 5.1 per cent in 1992-93. Our spending on public infrastructure is now at its lowest level for some 30 years. Delaying expenditure on public infrastructure only creates forward obligations for that expenditure. The Labor government will saddle us and the next generation with large levels of public debt as well as a range of expenditure commitments to boot. This is not responsible financial management. </PARA>

<PARA>The government can quite rightly be accused of ruining the economic future of this country. Not only has it put a million people out of work; it is running our public infrastructure into the ground with its grand plan to reduce the deficit to one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, at some point, all of this has to be repaid. The current government is simply imposing spending commitments on future governments. It is a shame that the government has chosen not to examine its account with a little more care. We do not have to dig very deep at all to find grotesque examples of wasteful government spending and mismanagement. We have had the sports rorts; we have had the Conroy report revealing an inefficient Customs Service; and we have had the statements entitled One Nation, Investing in the Nation and Working Nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one that came to light last week, through the coalition's Waste Watch Committee, was that staff from Purchasing Australia at the Department of Administrative Services have spent almost $6,000 on golf balls in the last two years. An amount of $6,000 might not be considered a great deal in terms of the $100 billion-plus that the government spends each year. But, if we give $6,000 to a struggling unemployed person, it would make a huge difference to that person. I think I would prefer the $6,000 to be spent on the unemployed rather than on bureaucrats buying golf balls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example is the millions of dollars that are squandered each year by our bureaucrats in hospitality expenses. I have a file in my office that details the hospitality expenses for the Customs Service over the last two years. It makes extraordinary reading: a $2,500 lunch here, a $2,500 dinner there. It is not their money, so why should they care? They eat well&mdash;six bottles of Rosemount Chardonnay with lunch of lobsters, prawns, barramundi. Our bureaucrats like fish; they like eating well. But it does not make sound financial management for bureaucrats to be eating so well when it is such a struggle for so many families to put three meals a day on the table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example was raised by Helen Hughes last week concerning the export market development grants. Professor Hughes believes that the EMDG scheme does next to nothing to help Australian exporters, but the program is kept alive and is promoted heavily by a network of former bureaucrats who now act as consultants to companies trying to maintain the EMDG system.

<PARA>Waste and bad management&mdash;that is the hallmark of this Labor government. But let me return to my original discussion on debt. As we know, the government plans to reduce the budget deficit to one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. So what is it intending to do to make smaller losses rather than bigger ones in coming years? What does this do to the actual level of Commonwealth debt? Each year the government records a deficit, the level of Commonwealth debt rises. So in 1990, the level of the Commonwealth's own debt, after swap transactions, was around $30 billion, but by 1995 the level of debt will be in the vicinity of $95 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total level of Australia's foreign debt fell in the March quarter to 38.6 per cent of GDP, coming off its peak of 41.6 per cent in the June and September quarters of 1993. This was largely due to the rising value of our dollar and rising direct foreign investment. But, while the total level of our foreign debt is falling, the government is increasing its foreign debt. Commonwealth and Reserve Bank foreign borrowing in the March quarter of this year was 25.2 per cent higher than it was 12 months ago. This is the future that the Keating government is carving out for us. At a time when it should be consolidating our financial position, the government has chosen to blow it out a little more. The government does not set a good example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could not let a discussion on the 1994-95 budget pass without making reference to the figure that has attracted the most attention&mdash;the 14.5 per cent investment growth forecast. The government thinks it can sustain investment growth at 14.5 per cent in the coming years with plant and equipment investment increasing by 18.5 per cent. The Treasurer has had to do some creative accounting to achieve this deficit reduction target, which is nothing more fanciful than the investment forecast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government claims that such figures were recorded through the latter 1980s, so its forecasts are not without precedent. But the investment growth that took place in the 1980s came more from investment in buildings and structures than investment in plant and equipment and that is something the government has failed to acknowledge. The government's management of the recovery has been so poor that we now find ourselves in a situation where we are damned if the investment comes and we are damned if it does not. Terry McCrann says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If investment does not pick up into the strengthening recovery, we will run into capacity crisis and rising inflationary pressures and a blowout in the current account deficit 1986 and 1989 style.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If investment does pick up . . . we will run into an interest rate crunch as the Government's need to borrow $23 billion clashes with business needs to fund $44 billion of investment. With the subsequent combination of a soaring dollar and rising interest rates a killer for the recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And underscored by the continued long-term trend in the household savings ratio. With business and government borrowing rising sharply, that can only be balanced by a huge rise in the current account deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So what on earth is the Reserve going to do&mdash;and when? Will it sit back and allow an unsustainable speculative boom to go roaring away? Or will it hike rates and send the dollar soaring anyway?</PARA>
<PARA>Few commentators have taken any relief in the economic growth that we are now experiencing. We are poorly placed as we come out of this recession. The government has failed to lift business investment. If it comes in waves, we will now pay the price. If it does not come, we will pay it anyway. This is the Labor government's style of economic management. It should realise that wild oscillations in economic policy will lead to wild oscillations in the economy. The Prime Minister introduced the worst recession since the Great Depression with his lack of understanding of monetary policy. We are now in the same position again where the government refuses to exercise fiscal restraint and interest rates can only go one way&mdash;clearing the way for our next downturn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have emerged from the recession, the government has demonstrated a distinct lack of commitment to responsible economic management. There are still 900,000 people on the dole queues and business investment is still to come through. The government has opted out on micro-economic reform. It is little wonder that offshore investment by Australian companies almost quadrupled last year while domestic investment waned. The government is not committed to reforming our economic landscape and it is not committed to sensible economic management. The government is already demonstrating that it cannot sensibly manage the recovery that is now occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policies it is putting in place, or not putting in place as the case may be, are ensuring that we are locked into another downturn in another couple of years time. If business investment does not come through in the waves that the government predicts and if it cannot find jobs for the unemployed, instead of training programs, it will have only itself to blame. Boom-bust economies is what the Prime Minister will be remembered for and nothing more&mdash;just overstimulating the economy and then overreacting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a surprise that the business magazine that voted him the world's best Treasurer went broke. Australian businesses and Australian people are sick of Labor's style of economic management. A coalition government will deliver reform to the economy, will create the conditions for sustainable economic growth and will promote economic stability. In short, we will be responsible financial managers of the Australian economy. I suspect that the deficit reduction target will be reached in 1996-97, but it will be a coalition government at the controls. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The budget this year was the first to be brought down in May and the first to be delivered by the now Treasurer (Mr Willis). It has interesting, if not startling, consequences for our Commonwealth borrowing requirements and the Loan Bill. Apart from the just mentioned distinguishing aspects, the budget was a continuation of Labor's fiscal incompetence. This budget was not particularly earth shattering and it did not, at first glance anyway, appear to be politically risky for the government. The budget provided the financial framework that detailed, in terms of Labor's rhetoric, how the white paper on employment and growth is to be funded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, the budget reflected a steady as she goes policy direction that built upon the tax increases of the 1993-94 budget and that predicted economic growth of 4.5 per cent over the next 12 months. All of this, as I have already indicated, has implications for the Loan Bill and the borrowing requirements of the Commonwealth. At first glance, this debt, which will arise out of this year's budget, is not as easy to criticise as last year's because the tax increases in the budget are implemented by stealth rather than by openly upping the taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bracket creep is an easy way for governments to increase income and other taxes, especially when they do not have the courage to raise taxes by legislative means. You will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that Labor criticised previous coalition governments for the impact of bracket creep on the total tax take. But in its decade or more in power Labor has done absolutely nothing to reverse that impact, and neither will it. Though the budget and the borrowing consequences of the budget appear to be politically sound, each will result in severe damage to our economy in the long run. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several reasons why this budget will impact negatively on our national economic prospects and why the budget projections are unlikely to be met. Included in the reasons are the size of the budget deficit, the way the proceeds of privatising government assets are being spent and the figures on which the budget is based. All of these have implications for the Loan Bill. The size of the budget deficit, which is projected to be $11.7 billion in the coming year, is an example of first-rate economic vandalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That deficit needs to be reined in. If it is not, there is a strong likelihood that interest rates will rise in the next 18 months as the federal government's call on national savings deprives the private sector of necessary investment funds. It is axiomatic that if the government raids the available but very limited savings&mdash;the historically low savings&mdash;in Australia to shore up its needs in deficit spending the private sector will be deprived of an equivalent amount of borrowings. So we see the dog chasing its tail, as it were. The end result of the government depriving the private sector of possible sources of capital, whether equity or borrowings, is a scarcity of funds which will flow through and feed higher interest rates over the coming months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In question time today the coalition mentioned a number of sources which estimate that interest rates will increase by up to three per cent within 18 months. If ever there were a risk that Labor could put our economic recovery in danger, it would be demonstrated by those misgivings and those rather foreboding estimates by a coalition&mdash;not this coalition&mdash;of very responsible bodies and entities in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget risks again locking Australia into the boom-bust economic cycle. Don Mercer of the ANZ put this budget in context when he was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> of 28-29 May as saying that Australia is `back on the path of boom and bust' and:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Failure to seize the opportunity of strong economic growth to cut the budget deficit more rapidly is going to leave Australia with higher domestic and external debt than is necessary or desirable. Put simply, most of the gains from a stronger economic outlook&mdash;the so-called growth dividend&mdash;are not being used to wind back the deficit and increase saving but will be spent.</PARA>
<PARA>The debt has to be financed whether by public or by private borrowings. We all know the dire state of savings in Australia so it is reasonable to assume there will be a mix of domestic and foreign borrowings. But however the money is raised the private sector will be tail end Charlie once again because it will have to take second place to the gilt-edged security which the Commonwealth will offer, and no doubt the Commonwealth securities will in due course reflect increases in interest rates to which I have already alluded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be made clear that no matter how desirable it is for governments to balance their budgets or to have a surplus there are times when economic fluctuations will force a government to run deficits. This is definitely true during a recessionary period. The ideal scenario is for a government to run modest deficits in periods of recession and surpluses in periods of economic growth, with the longer term&mdash;say, 10 years&mdash;net being a near-balanced budgetary position, preferably a surplus. I still maintain that the current budget deficit projections for 1994-95, and for 1995-96, are too high&mdash;the projection for 1995-96 is a deficit of about $5.5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even by the government's own estimates in the 1992 One Nation economic statement, the projected deficit is too high. In One Nation Prime Minister Keating gave an undertaking that the Commonwealth's budget deficit for 1994-95 would be less than $1 billion and that a surplus of $2 billion would be achieved in 1995-96. It is something of an old chestnut, almost, to say that the government has failed to meet these targets, but it is also true that it probably had no intention of meeting these targets, so how can we believe that this government will meet the revised estimates? Unfortunately for Australia I doubt that it can. Labor's past inept management of fiscal policy is a very good indication that it will not meet the deficit targets, and is especially the case with an election to be held within the next two years. For the government to meet the deficit of $11.7 billion the economy must achieve economic growth of 4.5 per cent this year, then average almost five per cent for the rest of the decade, and have a sharp increase in business investment of up to 14.5 per cent in this financial year, 1994-95, and an estimated 20.25 per cent in 1995-96. That is plainly ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government also relies on assets sales, the transfer of state debt payments and Reserve Bank profits. Assets sales alone account for almost $3 billion of government revenue in 1994-95, which will mainly come from the sale of its 75 per cent stake in Qantas. Other assets to be sold include Aerospace Technologies of Australia and part of the shipping company ANL&mdash;and we know what a hurdle, politically speaking, the Labor Party has to get over with its members. Whilst Labor budgeted for it, it still does not have the agreement in policy terms of its own members. It is not certain that the government will be able to meet the timetable for asset sales, and there is no guarantee that the government will receive its asking price in each or any instance of its projected asset sales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Problems with asset sales have the potential to blow out the deficit. It is as simple as that. If the economy fails to grow at 4.5 per cent, the result will be a reduced level of tax receipts and also an increase in the deficit. Looking at the record of Labor in government, I seriously doubt that the required asset sales will be achieved in the coming financial year. I hope in one way that they are achieved. Without asset sales and dividends from government business enterprises the deficit is actually close to $18 billion. This poses a dilemma because the government cannot sell assets year in and year out. There is only a limited quantity of assets that Labor can sell off. Sometime in the near future a Commonwealth government will have to tackle the underlying structural weaknesses of the federal fiscal position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the coalition believe that the proceeds of all asset sales should go to the repayment of debt and should not fund recurrent expenditure, as is happening today. The situation we are in is akin to a person borrowing $100,000 from a bank and spending it on holidays and parties, and generally living it up. In those circumstances, the debt still exists but there is nothing to show for it. If the government is going to sell Australia's assets, should we not see something for that? A reduction in debt and a resultant reduction in the cost of servicing our debt would free up expenditure for important national investment in infrastructure, which, incidentally, is at an historical low, or perhaps to reduce taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The training schemes as outlined by Labor will do nothing to relieve the plight of the long-term unemployed unless there are jobs available after completing training. If there are no jobs&mdash;I suspect there will not be&mdash;Labor is undertaking a dangerous, cynical exercise that will give false hope to many people and be analogous to pouring money down the drain. There will be nothing to show for this extra expenditure on training except for a highly agitated group of long-term unemployed and, of course, the subsequent increased debt and borrowing. Besides, how many employers will take on trainees given the now-under-review unfair dismissal provisions in the Industrial Relations Act brought forward by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton)?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date, the government has shown little inclination to balance the books by reducing its own outlays. That is another point of criticism. Reducing the funding levels to the states has been the government's preferred and virtually only method of reducing its outlays. Since 1982-83, grants to the states have declined in real terms by 1.7 per cent while Commonwealth own-purpose outlays have increased by 35.5 per cent. There we have it: the golden rule once again. He who has the gold rules and the Commonwealth has the gold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1994-95 budget projects increased total grants of 8.4 per cent to the states from 1993-94 to 1997-98. That is, however, not a real increase in funding, even if it comes about, because inflation will average greater than two per cent in each year. State funding compares with the 34.4 per cent increase in revenue the Commonwealth will receive over an identical period. So much for the government's vaunted but spuriously claimed belt tightening. If the federal government wants the states to carry the cost of micro-economic reform, it will need to increase state funding in real terms and the Commonwealth will also need to carry more of the burden of fiscal restraint. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see the government adopting some elements of Fightback in its recent white paper. The concept of a training wage is a necessary measure to give unemployed people the opportunity to gain skills and, hopefully, get a job. Labor continually fails to recognise that job growth will only occur if the macro-economic settings are correct and micro-economic reform is actually implemented. The government's budget strategy seems to merely throw money at the unemployment problem but fails to provide the incentive for the private sector to expand, increase investment and ultimately employ more Australians. After all, it is only in the private sector that real and sustainable employment can be generated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One wasteful aspect of public administration that the government fails to combat is the duplication of regulation and service provision. Commonwealth-state duplication has been an ongoing feature of public sector wastage; however, the problem has become worse in the last 25 years as the Whitlam and current Labor governments have sought to increase power at the centre. This is in direct conflict with the very purpose of a federation, where there is a proper division of powers to reflect the traditions and requirements of the modern state. To have two, and sometimes three in our case, levels of government providing the same or very similar services can only result in duplication, or obviously triplication by definition, and a resultant waste of our resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our aim in Australia should be to provide the public with quality government at the lowest possible cost. Our current level of duplication does not and will not allow that to occur and, quite frankly, penalises the community through higher taxes and unnecessary confusion. This confusion gets back to the lack of knowledge of which government is really responsible for the provision of particular services. We all, as individual representatives, encounter that confusion in our electorate offices day by day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely necessary for the federal government to voluntarily apply shackles to its own ever-expanding activities and set clear parameters within which it will legislate. This may involve leaving many functions in which the Commonwealth now dabbles to the states. It also more than suggests the need for the states to give the Commonwealth powers to legislate on some agreed national issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Commonwealth is to seriously cut back on recurrent expenditure, it should seriously examine the issue of federal-state duplication. Too many public servants are employed by Commonwealth departments and agencies to develop policies and guidelines for the spending of grants by the states. Even more are employed to simply monitor how the states spend the money they get from the Commonwealth, by way of grants or otherwise. The states obviously have their own bureaucracies that develop policy to suit the needs of their own states and that is the way it should be, I think. Who can say that state governments do not know best what their populations want and what is in their best interests? The government which is closest to the people knows best what the people want. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Obviously, the effect will be to reduce the present rate from 12 per cent to 11 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill amends three acts: the Sales Tax (Customs) (Wine&mdash;Deficit Reduction) Act 1993, the Sales Tax (Excise) (Wine&mdash;Deficit Reduction) Act 1993 and the Sales Tax (General) (Wine&mdash;Deficit Reduction) Act 1993. Are the titles of those acts not a nonsense, since each has deficit reduction in its title but each involves an increase or an imposition of a new tax? The language used by this government to obfuscate, confuse and conceal the real effect of its legislation is bordering on childish. We have examples of that arising out of last year's budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These three acts, rather than one, were initially required because of the constitutional issues raised at the time by the Senate involving a tax on wine. That tax was imposed for the first time in last year's budget and represented a betrayal of the electorate in the wake of the 1993 general election. The future increases that were then passed&mdash;I remind the House that they were in that legislation&mdash;as part of the 1993-94 budget measures for commencement on 1 July 1995 and 1 July 1996 will also be removed. So there we have it&mdash;a Labor government apparently seeking partial absolution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were opposed to the original bills as passed by both houses last year. As a result, we naturally do not oppose the measure before us, because it proposes an effective reduction of an offensive and counterproductive tax. Reduced tax rates on low alcohol wine and similar products should be encouraged as a general rule, but so should lower tax levels overall. Under the existing law, low-alcohol beverages&mdash;wine, cider, beverages similar to wine and cider, such as wine coolers, mead, perry, sake and other similar fermented beverages&mdash;are included, all of which are sourced from Australia or overseas and are taxed presently at the rate of 12 per cent. I stumbled when I read `sake', but I guess that is part of our deal with Japan. I hope Japan reciprocates by perhaps dropping the barriers it puts on our exports of rice, beef and other produce commodities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that goods are taken to be low in alcohol if they contain no more than 1.15 per cent by volume of alcohol. From 1 July 1994, the rate on low alcohol wine, cider and similar beverages was to rise to 14 per cent, with a further rise of 16 per cent on transactions on or after 1 July 1995. The sales tax wine deficit reduction acts of 1993 were introduced to put in place the government's 1993-94 budget impositions on wine, cider and similar beverages. Apparently, the three acts were required to overcome Senate opposition to the original budget proposal. In the event, both the Australian Democrats and an unrepresentative few in the wine industry took the easy way out and did the most curious of deals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That aside, each of the wine deficit reduction acts modifies the effect of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1992 in so far as that act deals with sales tax imposed by the corresponding sales tax exemption act. This bill will amend each of those acts to remove the overall effect of the 1993-94 budget impositions on low alcohol wine, cider and similar beverages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wholesale sales tax will increase by one per cent on and from 1 July 1995, and the rate on low alcohol wine, cider and similar beverages will also increase by one percentage point to 12 per cent on and from 1 July 1995. So it is only a temporary respite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial impact of this bill will be a loss to Commonwealth revenue of an ill-gotten $0.4 million in 1994-95, $0.5 million in 1995-96 and $0.6 million in 1996-97 and the ensuing financial year. Overall, the amount of Commonwealth revenue that is forgone from this bill might be said to be negligible. To the extent that that is the case, it is a change for the better that the sales tax on low alcohol wine and similar products will be cut. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consumption of these low alcohol products and light beers should be encouraged ahead of full strength alcoholic drinks. I believe that most honourable members are aware or have some idea of the total costs of excessive alcohol consumption. A study entitled `Estimating the economic costs of drug abuse in Australia' by David Collins and Helen Lapsley was published in 1991. Amongst other things, it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Alcohol consumption represents estimated expenditure on alcohol by abusers, net of taxes and subsidies, estimated to be $1,651 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This represents the resources which would have been released to the community in 1988 had there been no abuse of alcohol.</PARA>
<PARA>The net health care costs in 1988 totalled a claimed $581 million, with the largest component being an extra operating cost to the hospital system of $388 million. With the spiralling costs of health care, I suppose these alcohol related costs would now be much higher&mdash;that is, if the escalated costs are to be believed or are in any way near accurate. The costs may not only translate into increased budgetary outlays for the hospital system but also impact on the number of people killed in car accidents, the increased level of risk in the workplace and the catastrophic level of family breakdowns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of road accidents in 1988 where alcohol was said to be a major cause was a claimed $212.2 million. I am sure it is a truism that too many of us still drink and drive having little regard to the wellbeing of other road users and pedestrians. The human death toll is the worst aspect of this irresponsible behaviour, although there is also the cost to the community of the extra hospital beds needed and the clearing up of accident sites. Then there is the untold damage done to the relatives of victims&mdash;and no price can be put on that. The value of lost production due to alcohol in 1988 was an estimated $801.2 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The workplace is an area where occupational health and safety issues are made worse by those who drink on the job or who come to work a little under the weather after a heavy night before. In many cases, such workers are a danger to themselves and others. Perhaps they should be sent home when they pose a danger to other workers. But we know that the industrial relations laws overseen by this government and some state governments make that a practical impossibility on occasions. This is especially so in industries such as construction, where the workplace has obvious and, I can assure the House from personal experience, sometimes not so obvious dangers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As many honourable members well know, we all like an occasional drink. But there is a need for governments to try to reduce excessive alcohol abuse without resorting to the excesses pursued by the anti-tobacco zealots. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned previously, the coalition is more than happy to see Labor reduce at least one tax, albeit minimally. However, Labor's tax record is not a good one. It is not one of which it can be very proud. Indeed, its record is one of deceit. Prior to the last election, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) promised the Australian people that there would be no tax increases if his government were re-elected. That is a matter of history. It is not disputed that the 1993-94 budget simply demonstrates the deceit to which I have referred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As you will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, Labor used that budget as a means of increasing a whole raft of taxes and breaking promises too numerous to recall. The budget increased the price of petrol by 3c per litre on 18 August 1993, a further 2c per litre on leaded petrol from 1 January 1994 and a further 2c per litre on leaded petrol on 1 August 1994. All that has implications for the Loan Bill and Commonwealth borrowings. Obviously, tax increases have the effect of reducing it. They can be measured against the prospective and probably more desirable reductions in expenditure that would achieve the same end without further impositions on the Australian population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall that, in those days, the government used the imagery of small children to justify its tax grab through the petrol pump. One cannot sink much lower than that. It was not even used in an election context. By any standards, it was a pathetic ploy that only served to heighten to new extremes Labor's cynicism towards government, claimed on the part of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After all, Labor is always talking about social justice and looking after the poor. What was fair about hitting the poor at the petrol bowser while dishing out money to the wealthy? What was just or fair about slashing the value of older cars owned by low income earners while reducing the price of luxury cars? We all know that Labor's support of social justice is a sham. Labor's social justice catch calls would do Goebbels proud. Labor screws the less well off but convinces them that it is really looking after their best interests. That is like Goebbels if ever there were an example. Labor is only interested in vote catchers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The 1993-94 budget also introduced a tax on long service leave. This is an insidious tax that retrospectively impacts on all accumulated long service leave. Sales tax on wine was increased by 55 per cent, which is the reason for this bill now before us. The government, in its rush to gain extra revenue, never thought to limit the increase in sales tax on low-alcohol wine, despite the enjoiners of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) and others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other tax rises include the tax imposed on credit unions and the new tax on frequent flyer schemes. There is the famous government backdown on tax cuts that is up there with George Bush's `read my lips, no new taxes' comment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Remember those tax cuts that were l-a-w? If we believe this mob, they have now been deferred until 1988. But we will never see them.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year's budget increases the overall tax take. The tax increases in this budget are implemented by stealth rather than openly upping tax rates. Bracket creep is an easy way for governments to increase income taxes, especially when they do not have the courage to raise taxes by legislative means. Labor criticised the previous Liberal government for the impact of bracket creep on the total tax take, but Labor, in its decade or more in power, has done nothing to redress the situation, and nor will it. Labor's record is a debacle. This is the case even before examining the complexity of the tax system, the high cost of compliance and the frequency of legislative change, all of which the Assistant Treasurer can claim credit for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We do not oppose this bill because it confers a benefit. Of course we will not, given the rapacious approach of this government towards taxation generally. I will dwell momentarily on this bill, which is under the guillotine until 10.30 p.m. It is a measure which we do not, and never did, oppose. If the government was of a mind to and followed its own rhetoric, it could have been referred to the Main Committee. Be that as it may, it was not a measure which was required or deserved to be under the guillotine.

Consequently, the bill before the House is designed to address those unintended consequences.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Curtin has said, the proposal in the 1993 budget was a very simple one. It was devastating from the point of view of my electorate. The proposal was to take wine, which was then taxed at 20 per cent, and lift its tax rate to 31 per cent. This proposal was opposed by the industry and by the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a successful industry that had built up its overseas sales program dramatically. In export terms it had gone from an almost insignificant export base to an export base of 80 million litres each year. It had a target, which it may very well realise, of producing in excess of $1 billion in export income by the year 2000. This was the industry, looking so successful, that attracted a new tax regime from this government. Frankly, what the wine industry has seen while this government has been in power has been a dramatic change in its fortunes. It is not particularly to the government's credit, but I must recognise that while this government has been in office the wine industry has seen this dramatic change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I first came into this parliament and the Hawke government then came into power, the wine industry was in all sorts of trouble. It entertained and was involved in a vine pull scheme in the years 1984 and 1985. So desperate was the outlook for wine grape growing in Australia that the government saw the only way out for primary producers being the government's participation in some sort of vine pull scheme. The government, appropriately, intervened at that stage. It is incredible that in less than a decade we have seen this dramatic turnaround in the fortunes of the wine industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fair to say that the wine industry can now claim to be largely independent of government support. There is very little government involvement in the industry. There is some assistance with research and development. There is no protection from imports. There are no tariff walls currently preventing the importation of wine products into Australia. This is an industry which is labour intensive. It dramatically value adds. It has become the benchmark for a number of other industries that the government is seeking to encourage. It is fair to say that while the ALP has been in power the wine industry in Australia has seen a dramatic recovery, although I would hasten to add that I do not think the government can solely claim the credit for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My criticism was that in the last budget the industry, being seen to have taken the first tentative steps to a positive recovery, then found itself saddled with a substantial tax. It was saddled with a proposal to raise the base tax on wine from 20 per cent to 31 per cent&mdash;an effective hike of 55 per cent. For that reason, as everyone in this House is aware, the industry and the coalition joined forces and said that they would frustrate the government's budget process because they felt that this sort of impost on the wine industry was unfair. Ultimately the industry capitulated. The government put to it a package that suggested that the industry would progressively be taxed at a tax rate that would increase from 21 per cent to 26 per cent. The government agreed to an inquiry into the industry in the interim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is about the way in which a fledgling industry associated with the wine industry was caught up in that government proposal. While the honourable member for Curtin made much of the increase in sales tax from 20 per cent to 31 per cent, even more dramatic was the proposal to raise the tax on low-alcohol wine from 10 per cent to 21 per cent, which effectively was over a 100 per cent tax slug on the low alcohol wine industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was good reason to be indignant about that. Here was an industry offering an alternative to alcoholic beverages for those who for one reason or another find it difficult to responsibly use alcoholic beverages. This industry was saddled&mdash;it may have been unintended&mdash;with a tax hike of over 100 per cent. The industry caught in this was the industry producing alcoholic beverages with an alcoholic content of under 1.15 per cent. In my electorate, one of the largest producers of low alcohol wine is a winery known as Chateau Yaldara. The product it has specialised in is a de-alcoholised wine, the alcohol content of which is well below 1.15 per cent. In fact, the average alcohol content is probably 0.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This de-alcoholised wine is produced by a vacuum process. With the use of a vacuum, the alcoholic spirit is taken off and the alcohol content of the wine is reduced to 0.5 per cent, as I have said. This is an alcohol level that is all but insignificant. But this product was being treated by the government as if it were an alcoholic beverage of closer to 1.15 per cent. Chateau Yaldara found that its dramatically low-alcohol product was disadvantaged in shelf price terms compared with its competitors. Chateau Yaldara pointed out to me that it was seen as being competition for the wine industry but, in reality, its major competitors were non-alcoholic beverages, such as grape juice, which trade under brand names such as Grapella. Chateau Yaldara was facing a real shelf price differential simply because of this budget decision. As a result, its market share was lost because its product was seen as being priced out of the market relative to its major competitors, which were low-alcohol or non-alcoholic drinks principally of pure fruit content. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of this was done for what was effectively negligible budgetary impact. To be fair, I must acknowledge that, having approached the office of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) on a number of occasions and having earlier this year put a question without notice on this issue to the then recently appointed Treasurer, the Treasurer did respond. I believe that part of what we are currently dealing with tonight is a result of the Treasurer's response to my question. I regret that the question was necessary and I regret the unintended consequences that occurred, but I acknowledge that the Treasurer was at least gracious enough to recognise the inconsistency in what the government was proposing. In the interests of tax equity, the Assistant Treasurer has introduced this legislation which largely addresses that inequity. In that sense, I welcome it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I have the opportunity to deal with this question of beverage inequity, I would also like to point out to the Assistant Treasurer, while he is here tonight, that one of the other areas of major tax inequity currently affecting horticultural and viticultural products has also been taken up by the government but has not been acted on legislatively. I refer to the inequity that currently occurs with respect to the way fruit juice is taxed in Australia. I trust that the Assistant Treasurer is aware of the proposal from one of his own colleagues, Senator Nick Sherry, who is chairman of the horticulture task force. He recommended that pure fruit juice in Australia ought to be treated as tax exempt. That was meant to be a particular handout to the fruit industry. It was recognition of the fact that under GATT the current arrangement which exists for the fruit juice industry, which allows those Australian producers who produce a product containing at least 25 per cent Australian juice to have a tax reduced regime, will be lost because that proposal is seen as GATT unfriendly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sherry has recommended that, in order to compensate for that, the government ought to consider making pure fruit juice products tax exempt. I would like to commend that to the Assistant Treasurer. It does have a real sense of equity about it. Pure milk, which is a beverage that is unadulterated and that has no flavouring added, is tax exempt. I fail to see why one who squeezes a pure food product out of fruit should be disadvantaged compared with someone who squeezes a pure food product out of an udder. It would seem to me that the two tasks are much the same. What is being produced is a pure food product. It would be appropriate for the government, in the interests of tax equity and in the interests of recognising the disadvantage that will be suffered under the GATT negotiations, to act on this in the same spirit as it has acted in the interests of the low-alcohol wine industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My address this evening is about environmental education at Glengarry Primary School in my electorate. Education about the environment, in the environment and for the environment is becoming important in our community. Responsible management of our environment is also becoming increasingly important to the planning of industries and the work of governments. Recognising this, the Glengarry Primary School community has encouraged the development of a comprehensive environmental education program at its school.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Glengarry Primary School has received state and national recognition for the excellence of its environmental education program. The school has won several awards for its work, including the Education Department Innovations Award of $2,500; the Energy Management Award of $5,000 from the government of Western Australia; the Earthworm Award; the John Tonkin Greening WA Award; the Grouping Greenies Award from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Family Circle</EMPHASIS>; and the Uncle Toby's Landcare Award. The school was also a finalist in the Young Achievers Award. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The school has also received other forms of recognition. Television reports and documentaries, such as on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>, have focused on the exemplary nature of the school's environmental program. The school was featured at the national Recycle 93 conference. It also attracted the attention of environmental educators and community groups from other states and overseas. Locally, the school has strong links to local government and assists a range of schools and organisations with their environmental programs.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Glengarry Primary School community now invites key industries, government agencies, community groups and other organisations to join with it in widening the support for environmental education across the school system and the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the Glengarry Environment Centre. To support the progressive nature of the school's programs and to further encourage innovation, the school environment committee, the HOPE group, has decided to establish an environment education centre on the Glengarry Primary School site. The goal or mission of the centre will be to develop Glengarry Primary School as a key centre for best practice in environmental education, responding to the needs of its students and community, while assisting other schools, other agencies, industry and community organisations with environmental education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To achieve this goal, the Glengarry Environment Centre will develop more effective ways to educate young people to work as responsible and informed citizens capable of developing and improving their environment. It will demonstrate environmental projects that other schools can use as models for environmental education. It will demonstrate and apply environmentally friendly technologies. It will provide direct support to teachers in other schools in the development of environmentally based teaching programs, learning experiences based on special projects and school environmental policy. It will assist other agencies and organisations in the development of relevant education materials; for example, those based on landcare, energy conservation, wetland rehabilitation, recycling, safe environmental practices and environmental monitoring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Glengarry Environment Centre will provide in-service courses for teachers, often in collaboration with other organisations. It will assist other agencies and organisations to provide special environmental education experiences for students; for example, those based on environmental camps, excursions and competitions. It will facilitate the distribution of information about environmental projects and programs to schools and the community. It will support and lead networks of environmental educators. It will display evidence of student achievements and important environmental information. It will also encourage appropriate research by tertiary educators concerning environmental education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The centre will be staffed by a person experienced in environmental education, and this position hopefully will be funded and sponsored by the education department of Western Australia. The centre will be constructed according to solar passive design principles and will have multi-functional work, display and storage areas. The day-to-day operation of the centre will be managed by the education department, through the principal, with guidance from a management advisory group. The advisory group is likely to consist of representatives from the school community, the HOPE group; sponsors; teachers; and the education department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to thank Mr Alan Lloyd, a very well-known local environmental activist in my electorate, for providing me with this information about the Glengarry Environment Centre. I am well aware of the tremendous input that Glengarry Primary School makes to student environment education. I commend this project to the parliament and my local community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member opposite said, `Don't we all?' Over the last year or so we have heard a lot about the Child Support Agency through the comprehensive first report of the inquiry into the operation of the Family Law Act conducted by the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues; through the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), the chairman of that inquiry into the Child Support Agency; the child support inquiry hotline; and, as has been said earlier, through the numerous complaints and inquiries that all of our electorate offices receive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier today a very scathing report from the Australian National Audit Office was tabled in this place, and yet again it reported on the management and operations of the Child Support Agency. It found very serious deficiencies, unacceptable delays in dealing with client phone calls and letters, unsatisfactory management of debtors and ineffective tracing of the defaulting debtors and variations in branch procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report made recommendations that undoubtedly will be looked at by members and committees of this House. It talked about the need to improve recording and reporting, corporate planning, performance monitoring and reporting, staff training, and the development of resource management. The report went on to say that the Child Support Agency has accepted the majority of the Australian National Audit Office recommendations and acknowledges the value of feedback on its performance. However, the Child Support Agency claims that the lack of staff resources is retarding the implementation of some of the recommendations of the Australian National Audit Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a new initiative being started in Queensland which will get under way in the Toowoomba area next week. The Deputy Child Support Registrar in Brisbane, Bill Mulherin, and his staff will be starting a help and awareness project.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) The number is unknown. Applications to Australian Hearing Services (AHS) do not distinguish between full and part pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) At the time Commonwealth fringe benefits were made available to part pensioners (1 April 1993), the Government estimated that 38,000 part pensioners would apply to AHS for services over two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) $3.5m in 1992-93; $8.2m in 1993-94.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) A revised estimate of the cost of services provided to part pensioners is not available (see (a)). However, the estimated cost of services to be provided by AHS contractors in 1993-94 has been revised to $31m. This is attributed to high levels of demand from pensioners, due in some measure to the attractiveness of programmable hearing aids provided by AHS, a greater take-up rate of concessions, and higher than anticipated contractor prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(e) This cost cannot be established in the absence of numbers of part pensioners applying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(f) The average waiting time at AHS hearing centres in April was 6 weeks. Records of contractors' waiting times are not available to the Government, although AHS has not received any complaints from clients about lengthy times for services.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) &amp; (2) The CAA has advised that to operate commercially in Australia, other than on a temporary basis, a foreign pilot must obtain an Australian Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL) or Air Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL). To achieve this, an applicant must pass the appropriate Air Law theory examination and flight test. Applicants for the ATPL are also required to hold an Australian command multi engine instrument rating which would involve an additional theory exam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once the licence is issued and the CAA's computer records are updated, there is no way of distinguishing those pilots who previously held overseas qualifications from those that were products of the Australian licensing system. In other words, once they are issued with the Australian licence, they are no longer considered `foreign pilots' per se.</PARA>
