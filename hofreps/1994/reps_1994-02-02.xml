<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before my comments were interrupted last evening, I indicated that I would return to a number of the points raised by speakers on both sides on the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Bill. A large thrust of the comments of the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), dealt with why we might not simply be better placed picking up state laws. The question asked was whether it would not be easier for state police, who are responsible for policing federal laws, to also be subject to the provisions of the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has acted as it has to codify federal law for precisely the same reason it acted as it did some time ago to codify those laws relating to interviews for federal offences. It is anxious to avoid injustice, whereby those who are accused of federal offences are treated differently in different jurisdictions. That, of course, was the fundamental principle underlying the whole approach taken by the Gibbs committee and is reflected in the detention before charge recommendations which we enacted some time ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, we are not prepared to accept the lowest common denominator approach. We are not prepared to accept provisions which have been roundly criticised in relation to civil liberties in a number of states in relation to their procedures. We think it far better to codify the law and to protect the interests of individuals, subject to law enforcement, by making sure that we have a well researched and well thought out Commonwealth code that applies across the board to all who are subject to Commonwealth offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are provisions that can apply if difficulties arise. State police have been trained very successfully in the part 1C requirements and have been successfully using them for two years. State police are familiar, as they have had to become over a long period, with the differences between state and federal laws on drug law enforcement where, depending on the facts of the case, they have had the option of using powers under section 10 of the Customs Act or state law. The police are not as ignorant of these differences as the honourable member for Tangney suggests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, any national policing enforcement agency, such as the Australian Federal Police, has to be able to transfer its personnel and resources from state to state. Its personnel are confronted with training and mobility problems if they have to deal with different procedural laws in different jurisdictions. The federal government has recognised its prime responsibility is to ensure that the Federal Police operates efficiently and under a clear and uniform scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other point that the shadow Attorney-General raised was on proposed new section 3ZV, which deals with forensic samples. That provision provides that, for this purpose, the Commonwealth will continue to rely on state law. This is only because I am still waiting on the results of an attempt by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General to settle on an agreed national approach in relation to forensic samples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated on page 5 of the second reading speech, this arrangement is for bridging purposes. I expect that I will soon be in a position to present a bill on that subject. I think it is the responsibility of the federal parliament to tackle such fundamental issues, rather than hiding behind state laws, which in some cases may be quite unacceptable. In that regard I instance the very strong criticisms that have been made by a number of commentators in relation to recent Victorian provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I can turn to the contribution from the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), he commenced by indicating that on a personal basis he would wish that the matter be referred to the House of Representatives standing committee as he had not yet had the opportunity to peruse the bill and to consider its contents. The submission might be honest but certainly it is novel. This legislation has been 18 years in the gestation. It arose out of the Gibbs committee report, which has been public for a substantial period. The Gibbs committee report was the subject of extensive submissions by law societies throughout Australia and was probably one of the most widely canvassed pieces of preparatory work for legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the bill was first in caucus committee's hands in November of 1992, some 12 months ago. Its actual passage through caucus was on 26 October 1993, which preceded the much canvassed overseas trip of the honourable member for Banks. Since then, there has been 2 1/2 months during which this bill has been available for comment. Some of those in the community concerned about this matter, principally Mr Sides and others, have taken the opportunity to write to the government to express their views on some of the clauses. Where that has been done, there has been an extensive correspondence between me and those who have made the submissions. Indeed, the government has responded positively and, in the committee stage, will put forward some amendments which have originated out of that correspondence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Practice at the New South Wales bar may have changed since the time I was briefly there, but I would have thought that on a most important matter such as this, which the honourable member for Banks has indicated is perhaps the most basic and fundamental of legislation, a barrister who received a brief so well notified in advance and who then came before a tribunal saying that a further adjournment was required before one could read it or make submissions on its merits might find it difficult to get too much sympathy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reject entirely any inference or implication that the Attorney-General's Department or I, as Minister for Justice, have a mentality that is all one-way, eroding individuals' rights in favour of securing convictions. Indeed, the very provisions that I referred to earlier, part 1C of the Crimes Act, reflect a very strong determination to move to ensure that abuses of civil rights are prevented from occurring under federal law enforcement. I think everybody who has been concerned about police-citizen relations would say that one of the most odious of alleged abuses is that of verballing. The present requirements to videotape confessional materials and to limit the time in which people are subject to interview have been enormously positive in ensuring that the appearance of propriety and the actuality of propriety coincide. This government has been acutely interested in ensuring the protection of civil liberties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I defer to no-one in my record as a person who has worked for Aboriginal legal services and various other organisations on the ground in relation to those who are subject most to the sharp edge of law enforcement in my commitment to civil liberties. I do not think the implication was directly made, but nonetheless there may have been some who thought that there was an inference that this government has less than a full commitment to civil liberties. I reject that entirely on behalf of myself, the Attorney-General and the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the few minutes that remain I turn to the comments made by other speakers in the debate. With no offence to them, I will not mention them each by name because many of the matters they raised canvassed or traversed similar ground. There was reference to clause 3E(2), which provides that a search warrant may be issued to search people. The important point about clause 3E(2) is that it provides for judicial supervision and recognises the facts of criminal behaviour&mdash;that criminals are mobile. The main thing about the warrant is that it is judicially supervised, no way arbitrarily, and is fundamentally no different from a search warrant of premises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extension of the search warrant to cover the search of persons on the premises is supported by strict requirements on the issuing officer at proposed subparagraphs 3E(5) and 3E(6) to state in the warrant the grounds for the search&mdash;such as the concealment of evidence or the use of the thing to commit an offence  which is the subject of the search&mdash;and the kind of search authorised. Under clause 3E(4) there is also a requirement to state the description of the premises and the times at which the warrant may be executed. Again, that makes the matter entirely the subject of judicial supervision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are criticisms about clause 3E(4)(d) in relation to the naming of persons to be responsible for executing warrants. It was decided in the legislation that only one person should be responsible for the warrant; that is, a named person. But the definition of the executing officer provides that the police may change the named person. That sheets home the responsibility to the named person so that there can be no defence that he thought another person was taking responsibility. I think that is a very important provision and is entirely consistent with the government's defence of civil liberties, and to ensure that where the execution of a warrant in these circumstances is carried out the person who does take charge of the operation cannot evade responsibility for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were also some comments made in relation to the matter of name and address. Certainly, I think there is no doubt in the community that, in practice, this does occur. The Law Reform Commission in its earlier report many years ago pointed out that there was a need for the police to be able to exercise the right to ask witnesses, and those who are suspected of engagement in some crime, of their name and address to help the police to investigate a matter and to locate people, thus reducing time and costs. But, more than that, the Australian Law Reform Commission pointed out that in practice this power is exercised often abusively. Because the police know they have to exercise that power, they in fact arrest people or do things which are not necessarily strictly permitted by the legal framework in order to exercise a right which all of us concede should be exercised and which, in broad terms, the general community concedes to the police. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what we have done in this provision is to square up practice with law and to surround it with appropriate safeguards and guarantees for the personal rights of the individual. It is far better to establish legal controls over justifiable use of police powers than to turn a blind eye to abuse because the controls have not been formally recognised by the common law or because there may be some potential for misuse. It is entirely consistent, also, with the principle that underlies the legislation that greater emphasis should be placed by proceeding by way of summons as distinct from arrest. Unnecessary arrest is to be avoided. Part of that of course is that a person who might otherwise be arrested will be asked for his or her name and address and then proceeded against summarily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other points were raised in this debate. I will only have time to raise quickly the last of those points, in relation to arrest without warrant to arrest. There is nothing new about this provision except that we have provided for greater certainty by defining the exact circumstances as to when such arrest should occur. The police have always been able to enter premises without a warrant where it is absolutely necessary, such as when in pursuit of a person whom they need to arrest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Previously, this power has depended largely on the common law, which is well described in the New South Wales Supreme Court case Lippl v. Hines, at page 620 18 New South Wales Law Reports No. 620 (1989). In that case at page 630 Mr Justice Hope lamented that there was no statute which deals with these matters in a comprehensive way and the resolution of the position under general law imposed no little difficulty. The bill does precisely that. It spells out in clause 3ZA the limited circumstances in which the power can be exercised. I believe it is entirely consistent with the commitment of this government to codify the law to protect civil liberties of the individual and to ensure that it responds constructively to the Gibbs committee and the work of the Australian Law Reform Commission. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>The amendments are quite brief in scope. I table the supplementary explanatory memorandum which sets out the amendments and the reasons why they have been moved. There are two provisions that are included, one of which has been dealt with following correspondence discussed in the second reading speech between Mr Sides and myself. It deals with the question of when a police officer is not executing a warrant but exercising the powers of entry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill had provided that where police officers in the execution of a warrant came to the door of a household they had to announce their presence unless there were certain limited circumstances whereby their own safety or the safety of those inside was thought to be at jeopardy. However, by omission that provision had not been included in those circumstances where entry without a warrant was facilitated by this bill. This amendment tidies up an omission, which was also made in the recommendations to us by the former chief justice Sir Harry Gibbs in his bill, to ensure that there is a consistency of approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is again consistent with the government trying to avoid the sort of instances that arose in the Gundy case such as where without notice a door is broken down, the police enter a house, the inhabitants are naturally frightened and possibly likely to panic and do untoward things, and where violence is potentially aggravated. The bill does provide for appropriate exceptions so that police are not placed in jeopardy or in any harm's way. As the committee would expect, the exceptions are common sense ones and protect the interests of both those who are involved in the enforcement of the law and those who are its potential victims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other provision is to enable the police to exercise the powers in this bill where other Commonwealth legislation also provides for enforcement mechanisms. The shadow Attorney-General in his comments earlier pointed out that there are different enforcement mechanisms provided for under other Commonwealth law. This, I believe, will eventually become a codification of the way in which the Commonwealth will proceed. But, whatever the case, we want to make sure that the police have available to them the measures under this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than being a lowest common denominator, this really is, I think, a high watermark or a highest common denominator. But, of course, by its application and practice I think it will benchmark new standards which will become applicable to the investigation of offences across the board, at both a Commonwealth and state level. One certainly hopes that is the effect of it. With those brief remarks, I commend the government amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea was signed by Australia on 10 December 1982. Negotiation of the convention involved extraordinary time and effort. Negotiations took place over a period of nine years and involved approximately 160 countries. The convention is very broad in scope and virtually codifies human use of the oceans. It contains provisions governing the limits of national jurisdiction over ocean space, access to the seas, navigation, protection and preservation of the marine environment, exploitation of living resources and conservation, scientific research, seabed mining and other exploitation of non-living resources and the settlement of disputes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has not yet ratified the convention. The government has stated that consultations are taking place with a view to overcoming difficulties that have arisen in relation to the convention provisions dealing with deep seabed mining. If those difficulties can be overcome, the government says that it will be in a position to give serious consideration to ratifying the convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any event, the convention is likely to enter into force in the near future. There have been 59 ratifications to date and 60 ratifications are required for the convention to enter into force. Additionally, many of the obligations contained in the convention are the subject of such widespread usage and practice by the international community that they have formed part of customary international law and are binding on Australia irrespective of the force of the convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In anticipation of ratification and in recognition of potential existing obligations, this bill seeks to give effect in Australian law to those provisions of the convention dealing with maritime zones. Specifically, it seeks to implement parts II, V and VI of the convention which deal respectively with the territorial sea and contiguous zone, the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins), in his second reading speech on this bill, has outlined the effect that the bill will have in relation to these matters. In short, the determination of the territorial sea is not to be inconsistent with the requirements laid down in the convention. The current adoption in Australia of a 12 nautical mile territorial sea accords with the limit prescribed by the convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A contiguous zone of no greater than 24 nautical miles from the territorial sea baselines is provided for in the bill. Within that zone Australia will be able to exercise rights of control in relation to breaches of laws committed on Australian territory or on its territorial sea. The bill provides for a 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone which allows, amongst other things, sovereign and other rights over both living and non-living resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill standardises the definition of the continental shelf in terms of the convention. At minimum, the continental shelf is deemed to extend 200 nautical miles. Where the physical configuration of the shelf allows, in certain instances that distance may be extended but with maximum limits being applicable. The bill makes consequential amendments to a number of other acts, principally incorporating reference to the convention and deleting reference to the 1958 Geneva conventions on territorial sea and the continental shelf which previously governed maritime zones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill incorporates as a schedule the full text of parts II, V and VI of the convention. This serves to emphasise the importance of the principles contained in the convention in the subsequent application and interpretation of the legislation. Successive Australian governments approached the United Nations conferences on the law of the sea, which resulted in the 1982 convention, in a bipartisan spirit. It was considered that as Australia is an island continent with extensive offshore areas and heavily dependent on international trade, it had a vital interest in the issues before the conferences on the law of the sea. In 1981 it was stated that it was an objective of the coalition government that the international law of the sea should be cleared of the doubts and uncertainties regarded as existing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a speech to this House in 1981, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Street, stated that to this end successive governments of Australia, on both sides of politics, had taken the view that Australia's substantial interests in the law of the sea would best be protected by the early adoption of a comprehensive and widely accepted convention. The passage of this bill, in enshrining into Australian law major aspects of the convention, is a major step from Australia's perspective&mdash;and subject to my comments to follow&mdash;in ensuring clarity and uniformity in the international laws governing the use of our oceans. For that reason, the coalition does not oppose this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do wish, however, to make comments on three specific matters. The first concerns undertakings given by the government when this bill was debated in the Senate. The second concerns the position of the states and the offshore constitutional settlement. The third raises a question that Australia may technically be breaching obligations at international law when this bill is passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the first matter, I wish to place on the record and clarify what may appear to be undertakings and commitments given in the Senate by the government in response to assurances sought by Senators Coulter and Chamarette. The concerns raised by Senators Coulter and Chamarette arise from articles 61 to 73 inclusive of the convention which are contained within part 5 of the convention dealing with the exclusive economic zone. Those articles are concerned with conservation and utilisation of living resources within the exclusive economic zone by states&mdash;states in the international legal sense&mdash;as well as rights of land locked and geographically disadvantaged states. The difficulties result from terminology that is used to describe the extent to which states may utilise living resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, article 61, which is headed `Conservation of living resources', deals with the need for states to implement measures to ensure that living resources are not endangered by over-exploitation. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such measures shall also be designed to maintain or restore populations of harvested species at levels which can produce the maximum sustainable yield&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>The use of the expression `maximum sustainable yield' is objected to by the two senators. Similarly, article 62, which is headed `Utilisation of living resources', states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coastal State shall promote the optimum utilisation of the living resources in the exclusive economic zone&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>The expression `optimum utilisation' is objected to by the senators. The problem is that these are no longer considered appropriate expressions when dealing with conservation and environmental protection. Since 1982 there have been considerable developments and changes of thinking in the international environmental law field. Utilisation of natural resources is now considered to be governed by principles of ecologically sustainable development. The expression objected to places insignificant emphasis on the ecological considerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette expressed the view that the term `optimum utilisation' has set the basic framework for over-exploitation of coastal waters around the world. The senator states that this is particularly the case in the context of article 62(2) which provides that countries that do not have the capacity to exploit their resources must allow other countries to exploit their waters to the optimum utilisation level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the difficulties in mind, Senator Coulter, during the Senate committee stage of this bill, sought certain assurances from Senator Collins. They were, first, that passage of the bill will not result in the application of articles 61 to 72 inclusive to the fisheries management regime in Australia and that fisheries management will continue to be consistent with the approach adopted in the national strategy for ecologically sustainable development, namely, that fisheries be managed within an ecosystem management framework; second, that the government will take up issues relating to conservation and utilisation of living resources in a range of international fora; and, third, that the government will call for the convention to be made consistent with the approach adopted in the national strategy for ecologically sustainable development. In particular, Senator Coulter stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a fisheries ecosystem management framework which will provide a more holistic and sustainable approach to management of aquatic resources.</PARA>
<PARA>While Senator Collins agrees that some of the language used in the convention is outdated, he says that the government's view is that the principles of the convention are not inconsistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development. He goes further in saying that the provisions should be implemented in a manner which is consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To support this view Senator Collins notes that agenda 21, which was adopted at the United Nations conference on environment and development in 1992&mdash;the so-called Earth Summit&mdash;provides that marine resources should be managed in accordance with the provisions of the Law of the Sea Convention. Given that the tenor of agenda 21 is to endorse the principle of ecologically sustainable development, it follows that the law of the sea provisions can be interpreted consistently with the principle. Applying that comment to Senator Coulter's third request, Senator Collins is effectively saying that there is no need to call for the convention to be made consistent with the principle, as it is already consistent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the first request, Senator Collins states that the Fisheries Management Act, which is the primary Australian legislation governing the use of marine living resources, requires, in its application, consistency with the principles of ecologically sustainable development. The act also requires regard to be had to proper conservation and optimum utilisation in accordance with the provisions set out in articles 61 and 62 of the convention. This emphasises, according to Senator Collins, that there is no inconsistency. He states that not only can those principles of ecologically sustainable development be implemented in Australia in our fisheries reserves but they should be. Thus no allowance is given that passage of the bill would not result in the application of articles 61 to 73 inclusive to the fisheries management regime in Australia because, in the government's view, those principles are not inconsistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the second requested assurance that the government will take up issues of ecologically sustainable development in international fora, Senator Collins states that these are the subject of debate and negotiation in various international fora, including: a conference organised by the United Nations on straddling stocks and highly migratory fish stocks; the United Nations sustainable development commission which is implementing agenda 21; the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, which is developing an international code of conduct on responsible fishing. According to Senator Collins, Australia is actively involved in all these processes and will wish to see results in accordance with the principles of ecologically sustainable development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette sought assurances of her own during the second reading debate. First, the senator called for notice to be given that the government believes that certain provisions of the convention do not form part of customary international law. Second was a call for the government to review the convention so that it is consistent with the International Convention on Biological Diversity and with the language found in agenda 21. Third was the call for the establishment of a national marine environment management authority to be responsible for Australia's progress in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No specific response was given to these requested assurances, although the statements made by Senator Collins in relation to Senator Coulter's requests deal with the first two matters. The response by the government would be that as the provisions in the convention are not inconsistent with the principle of ecologically sustainable development, there is no reason why the provisions may not form part of customary international law, nor is there any reason to review the convention. There is no response to the request for the establishment of a national marine environment management authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the minister's assurances that the principles of the convention are not inconsistent with the principle of ecologically sustainable development, that is not borne out by the language of the provisions referred to. Accepting that the issue is being hedged and hemmed by other activities, the government would still be well advised to take any opportunity that arises to have the convention amended. Serious consideration should also be given to an appropriate qualification or interpretation in any instrument of ratification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the second matter which concerns the impact of the bill on the Offshore Constitutional Settlement. The Offshore Constitutional Settlement constitutes an agreement reached in 1979 between the Commonwealth and the states that gives states legislative competence in respect of their territorial sea. At the time the agreement was reached the territorial sea was limited to three miles in breadth. It was accepted that the territorial limit of the grant of legislative competence to the states would remain at three miles, even if Australia subsequently moved to a territorial sea of 12 miles, which has since happened. The settlement also gives each state powers outside the territorial sea in respect of port-type facilities, underground mining extending from land within a state, and fisheries. The explanatory memorandum and the second reading speech both state that the bill does not affect the Offshore Constitutional Settlement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Western Australian Attorney-General has drawn my attention to clause 10A of the bill which, but for the assurances given, might raise a question concerning the applicability of the Offshore Constitutional Settlement to the exclusive economic zone. Clause 10A states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is declared and enacted that the rights and jurisdiction of Australia in its exclusive economic zone are vested in and exercisable by the Crown in the right of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA>The clause notes that this is equivalent to the existing section 11 of the Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973 in relation to the continental shelf. The important difference is that section 11 refers to the sovereign rights over the continental shelf and section 10A refers to the rights and jurisdiction over the exclusive economic zone. It is important to emphasise that the difference in wording seems to be the result of the wording of the convention and cannot be significant in relation to the states' extraterritorial legislative competence. By conferring jurisdiction over the exclusive economic zone, section 10A does not create an area over which the Commonwealth has exclusive jurisdiction to legislate inconsistent with the Offshore Constitutional Settlement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the third point, which concerns a possibility that Australia is breaching its obligations at international law by the passage of this bill. The 1958 Geneva Convention on the Continental Shelf is the predecessor to the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. As already noted, the 1982 convention has not entered into force; nor has it been ratified. The government has simply stated that if certain negotiations relating to deep seabed mining are successful it will give consideration to ratifying the convention. That means that there is no guarantee that Australia will ratify the convention in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the continental shelf, until the 1982 convention is ratified by Australia and enters into force, Australia will be bound at international law to comply with the provisions of the 1958 convention. Given that this bill incorporates a definition of the continental shelf that is different from that contained in the 1958 convention, my concern is that, if the resulting act comes into operation prior to the operation of the 1982 convention, duly ratified by Australia, Australia may be breaching its obligations at international law. The only circumstances in which that conclusion would not follow are where all the parties to the 1958 convention agreed to its termination, where specific provision was made in the 1958 convention, or where principles of customary international law superseded provisions contained in the convention. The first two matters are not applicable. As to the third, I am not convinced that the provisions of the 1982 convention relating to the continental shelf have formed part of customary international law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned at the beginning of this speech that many of the obligations contained in the 1982 convention are the subject of such wide-spread usage and practice by the international community that they have formed part of customary international law. That certainly is likely to be the case in relation to the territorial sea and the exclusive economic zone. It is not nearly as clear in relation to the determination of the continental shelf. Custom is developed where a rule is so widely applied as to suggest general recognition of the broad principle of law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One essential criterion to establish custom is widespread state practice. I use `state' in the international legal sense. The difficulty is that the definition of continental shelf is so complex in the 1982 convention that it has not as yet become a matter of wide state practice. That may be contrasted with the determination of the territorial sea, which is a relatively simple matter. As at February 1992, 113 countries had claimed a 12-mile territorial limit. Given the number of landlocked countries, the practice is almost universal. Only a few countries, however, have adopted in their own legislation the complex definition of continental shelf contained in the 1982 convention. A number more have adopted the broader definition contained in article 76(1). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A majority of countries still determine their continental shelf by reference to the 1958 convention. In my view that in itself would rule out any possibility that the provisions of the 1982 convention relating to the continental shelf have formed part of international law. I do not wish to overplay this point. Australia can hardly be criticised for seeking to bring itself into line with future obligations. It is further unlikely that, if a breach of international obligations does exist, anyone will complain loudly about it. I ask, however, whether any thought has been given to making the operation of the act conditional upon the entering into force of the 1982 convention. </PARA>

Indeed, we did so in 1982 but, like many conventions, Australia is lagging in ratification. The difficulty, as I understand it, lies in relation to the mining of the deep seabed and whether the resources there are to be defined as&mdash;and was defined by some countries leading up to the conference and discussions on the law on the sea&mdash;the common heritage of mankind, or humankind I suppose we should say these days, or whether they should come under a national jurisdiction. </PARA>

The term `innocent passage' is defined generally in articles 18 and 19.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason we are discussing the Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill this morning is to bring into line Australia's maritime zones in accordance with our entitlements under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1992. We have adopted that convention and signed it, but we have not yet ratified it. In reference to that, I can do no better than refer to the words of the then Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Collins, when he said in the other place last year while introducing the Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 1993:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is, apart from the provisions relating to mining of the deep seabed, generally reflective of international law. The Government considers that in relation to maritime zones the Convention should govern Australian practice.</PARA>
<PARA>We are a maritime nation. We depend upon the sea for the transport of almost all of our trade. We have a very large coastline, which we are responsible for protecting and managing. What changes are brought about by the legislation that is before us? Those changes are in four major areas: the establishment of rights in an exclusive economic zone; the adoption of a revised definition of the continental shelf; the assertion of rights in any nearby zone; and the adoption of new international legal provisions for the drawing of territorial sea zones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why should changes be made? There is not any hidden agenda or any other set of objectives to pursue this legislation. The last international convention with regard to territorial marine zones and continental shelves was the 1958 Geneva convention. The amendments will merely replace the operative provisions in Commonwealth legislation which refer to the 1958 convention with references to the 1982 convention. I believe that is the sensible thing to do. It will update domestic laws in line with international agreements. I welcome the support for this legislation from the other side of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that, the changes should assist in bettering our international relationships. Australia has been ahead of most of the world in this respect. Australia has come to realise that our marine resources are a precious national resource. They are also a precious international resource. We have had disputes in the past with some of our neighbours, such as Indonesia. It is possible that in the future there may be others&mdash;maybe Indonesia again or Papua New Guinea. So it makes good sense that we conduct our international relationships and we assert our rights within agreed international bounds of conduct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes have taken considerable time to come about. As a nation we have only gradually asserted our various maritime entitlements under international law. In 1979 a 200 nautical mile fishing zone was established. In 1983 certain territorial sea baselines were proclaimed. In 1990 the 12 nautical mile territorial sea was proclaimed in place of the previous three nautical mile territorial sea. We have really had only two areas of dispute in the past, but they have been resolved through cordial discussion and over time they have developed into mature relationships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why make the changes now? In areas such as the Pacific Ocean we have never been faced with such strong environmental and commercial pressures as we face today. Those pressures arise through the practice of driftnet fishing, deep sea mining, the possible disclosure of nuclear and industrial waste, the safety of the vessels that traverse those waters, and the potential for damage to the Australian maritime environment and Australian facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the 1982 convention will provide a sounder basis for Australia to protect its economic interests in environment, fisheries and mineral resources. The convention will give added weight to Australia's various attempts to safeguard Australia's coastal and marine environment from unsafe ships or accidents at sea by application of the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone. Article 73(1) of the convention, in part, reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coastal State may, in the exercise of its sovereign rights to explore, exploit, conserve and manage the living resources in the exclusive economic zone, take such measures, including boarding, inspection, arrest and judicial proceedings, as may be necessary to ensure compliance with the laws and regulation adopted by it in conformity with this Convention.</PARA>
<PARA>Article 21(1), in relation to the laws and regulations of the coastal state relating to innocent passage, reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coastal State may adopt laws and regulations, in conformity with the provisions of the Convention and other rules of international law&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and it is implied that they relate to the following&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the conservation of the living resources of the sea;  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) the prevention of infringement of the fisheries laws and regulations of the coastal State;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(h) the prevention of infringement of the customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws and regulations of the coastal State.</PARA>
<PARA>Article 21(4) reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Foreign ships exercising the right of innocent passage through the territorial sea shall comply with all such laws and regulations and all generally accepted international regulations relating to the prevention of collisions at sea.</PARA>
<PARA>Laws relating to incidents such as oil spills and the discharge of ballast water&mdash;that is, water that contains exotic species that are a threat to both our coastal and marine environments&mdash;could therefore be better enforced than they presently are, because the convention allows application of a state's laws within the exclusive economic zone. It is not unreasonable to say that unsafe ships could be seen as a threat to the environment of a coastal state and a threat to the sanitary laws of a state, accepting that any action taken against a ship would not contravene other international conventions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this respect, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure has played a very important part. The report about ship safety that was tabled in this House in December 1992 has had a major impact on international action in this respect. The response to that report and its recommendations from across the world has been very positive. For the remainder of the life of this parliament, the committee is inquiring into a reference given by Senator Collins a few months ago. The task before the committee has the support of both sides of the House. It has the support of all of the industry, the trade unions and the people using those services within Australia, and it also has extensive support internationally. It is to Australia's credit that the Australian government has responded very positively to the recommendations of that inquiry. The response from abroad from all of the major players has been a very positive one. </PARA>

The article reports that practice, operation, standard of safety on ships, training and all those other aspects that relate to ensuring the safe and innocent passage of ships through Australian waters will be covered by the committee. It also notes that, at my request, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">International Bulk Journal</EMPHASIS> will be contributing to the ongoing review. It is a great feather in the cap of Australia to have a major international journal covering all of those bulk carriers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier I mentioned ballast water. The impact of ballast water on the seabed environment in Australia's bulk ports is a matter of serious concern. Australian authorities were quite slow to recognise and realise its potential for damage and what arises from the introduction of alien organisms. I first raised this issue in the House in a question on notice in 1979&mdash;some 15 years ago. The response I received at the time virtually brushed it aside. As is recorded on page 2620 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> dated 29 and 30 May 1979, I asked:</PARA>

This investigation has been completed and a report is to be made to the Fishing Industry Research Committee. Further action will depend on the findings of that report.</PARA>
<PARA>When we raised that issue&mdash;and there was evidence of alien organisms in some of the major bulk ports in north-west Australia even at that time&mdash;it was brushed off as being some sort of fishing industry problem and it did not really matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has taken a long time to get to the position where the industry has issued guidelines for the management of vessels. The industry, in consultation with the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and the shipping, trading and fishing communities, has introduced its own voluntary guidelines for the discharge of ballast water. Those guidelines provide ship owners with a range of options to minimise the possibility of ballast water containing exotic species. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The guidelines apply to international ships arriving in Australia in ballast and seek to reduce the possibility of the introduction of alien species by encouraging a range of practices, including reballasting at sea, ballasting in deep water, disposal of sediments outside Australian ports, the non-discharge of water in Australian ports, participation in compliance arrangements and taking on ballast in agreed `clean' overseas ports. That has to be put into effect universally. There are ways and means of discharging water when the ships are well away from Australian waters or in waters where the temperature of the water and the organisms in the water are similar to what exists in Australian ports. Those actions could have been taken a long time ago had we been more alert to the nature of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the problems that exist with the passage of ships through Australian waters. The Australian government, through the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, is taking a much more effective role&mdash;arising from our committee's recommendations and report and from the minister's concern at the time&mdash;in respect of ships visiting Australian ports. In Australia in 1993, some 1,956 vessels were inspected. Of those 1,956 vessels, 1,350 had some form of defect. The range of defects varies from faulty fire appliances, faulty safety appliances and faulty lifesaving appliances to things such as rusted bulkheads, side shells of ships that have holes in them, faulty pumps, leakage, discharges and lifeboats that do not work. All of those defects are covered in those 1,350 ships. Of those 1,350 ships, some 75 were detained because their defects were of such a serious nature they could not be allowed to put to sea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that, Australia has been very much to the fore  in the establishment of the Asia-Pacific port state inspection group. That group has met. We hosted the secretariat last year in Melbourne. The group met again in Tokyo in early December. Some 17 of the 18 Asia-Pacific nations signed up and the 18th country is expected to sign. We expect the formal ratification of the formation of the group to occur in April and services then to commence. Those Asia-Pacific group countries will share and exchange information electronically on ship defects, ship performance and all of the factors that contribute to the level of ship safety attaching to vessels and the manner in which that safety is practised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to bear in mind, to get some sort of dimension on the potential for damage to Australian waters and Australia's environment, that in 1992 some 15,000 ships were operating in the Asia-Pacific region. By the year 2000&mdash;some six years hence&mdash;the new regional port state inspection service seeks to have 75 per cent of ships operating in the Asia-Pacific area inspected each year. They are the major steps flowing from the legislation before us. The legislation is extremely important, but the protection of the Australian maritime zones is even more important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased to see that the legislation before us has the support of both sides of the chamber. It recognises the problems in regard to ship safety and the point that I have been stressing about the discharge of ballast waters as an example of the damage that can be done to the Australian environment. Overriding that is the potential for catastrophe and major damage, as we saw with the near disaster of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> in July of 1991 and the six iron ore ships that sank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions in this legislation were all advised to the state governments.

In effect, the new maritime zones that are being provided for will bring Australia into line with its entitlements under international law. So we are not seeking something to which we are not entitled. The legislation brings us up to date, it brings us properly within the purview of international law and means that we will be able to manage and ensure our entitlements much better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Potential economic advantage to Australia arises from this legislation, particularly with the adoption of the enhanced definition of the continental shelf. That and the development of the contiguous zone will ensure that we have sovereignty and control over that precious asset, our marine environment and the seabed. This legislation is the important tool to enable us to carry that out. I am pleased to support the legislation. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In closing the debate on this important legislation, the Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill, I want to thank all those who have taken part in it. The bill has received support from both sides of the parliament, which I certainly appreciate. The bill probably has not had the amount of publicity and public interest that it deserves. Bipartisan support inevitably lowers the temperature of debate and, as such, the media is less likely to concentrate on it. In terms of Australia's national and commercial interests and of maritime safety, as the previous speaker, the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), has said, this is important legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to delay the House for a considerable period this morning, but a couple of matters have been raised by the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), the shadow Attorney-General, to which I want to respond. In a thoughtful and sensitive contribution, he raised three issues on which he sought a response and clarification from me. Those matters are as follows. Firstly, there were the issues raised by Senator Coulter and Senator Margetts in the Senate debate concerning this legislation and the effect of the international convention of 1982 on Australia's policies of ecologically sustainable development. I can but give him the same response and assurances that Senator Collins gave on those issues in the Senate, and that is that the government believes that the convention is not in contradiction of Australia's policies of ecologically sustainable development and, as such, there is no point of conflict. Therefore, the basic premise of those issues raised in the Senate by those two senators is not valid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Tangney then raised concerns that he had about the position of the states arising out of the constitutional agreement of 1979 in relation to the rights of the states vis-a-vis the seas and submerged lands, et cetera. I can simply say to him in response, as probably one of only two people still in this parliament now who were actively involved in the negotiations over those agreements between the states and the Commonwealth, that it is certainly not the intention of the Commonwealth that those agreements should be abrogated by this legislation in any way. I can give him an assurance that, if any problems of that sort emerge, the Commonwealth would certainly move to resolve any difficulties that arose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point that the honourable member for Tangney raised was a concern about the possibility that Australian law, once this bill becomes an act, would be in breach of international law. He made that comment on the basis of his knowledge that the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea had not yet come into effect because only 59 countries had ratified it. I can now tell him that, following the deposit of the 60th instrument of ratification of the convention by Guyana on 16 November 1993, the convention will come into effect one year from that date&mdash;on 16 November 1994. As such, our prospects of being in technical breach of international law should be removed as a real issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only other matters that I want to address which have been raised by some honourable members are concerns as to why Australia has not at this stage ratified the 1982 convention. Of course, the coming into force of the convention will be a step in the direction of Australia ultimately ratifying the convention and this bill represents a significant further step in that direction. Nevertheless, there are issues to be resolved before Australia will be in a position to ratify the convention. The major issue is that relating to part 11 of the convention&mdash;that is the part relating to the deep seabed mining regime. That part of the convention, unlike most other parts, does not represent customary international law and it has been the source of continuing disagreement between developing and developed countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there has been a series of negotiations conducted under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations aimed at reaching a resolution to the impasse over part 11. The latest round of those negotiations is taking place in New York right now. Australia has played a key role in these negotiations and progress to date has been good. A satisfactory outcome to those negotiations will encourage developed countries to become parties to the convention and thus achieve a convention of more universal application. On the domestic front, the government is examining whether any further action needs to be taken before Australia is in a position to become a party to the convention. As I indicated earlier, the adoption of this legislation represents a major step in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation will reap benefits for Australia. These will not only be in the form of potential resources of the exclusive economic zone and of an enlarged continental shelf, but also be in the form of increased enforcement rights. These enforcement rights will be available to be used to protect Australia's marine environment and our marine resources. I am sure that point is of interest to the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I say to the House that this is an important piece of legislation; one which I am sure that in future years will be a matter referred to not infrequently. I believe that when this legislation comes into effect, Australia's continental shelf and contiguous zone will be better protected. We will have taken the full available strength of international law and that is certainly what we as a government should be doing in the interests of protecting Australian rights. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The future of higher education in Australia, as is post-secondary education generally, is a matter of great significance for all Australians. I welcome the opportunity this debate gives to consider some of the future directions for Australia's university system. The coalition will not oppose the provisions of this bill. We do not oppose legislation just for the sake of doing so. A number of the provisions in this bill make sense, particularly those relating to better tax file number administration in respect of the higher education contribution system and the removal of the HECS liability for some AIDAB sponsored students from overseas. These are sensible and equitable refinements of legislation passed previously by this parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, the bill translates into legislation elements of the government's higher education policy agenda. I must say that some of these elements give us some cause for concern. While not opposing the passage of this bill, I cannot let these concerns go unremarked. My concerns include aspects of the government's provision for future growth in the higher education system, the allocation of new undergraduate places in 1996 and the need to top up university funding to make  allowance for the financially detrimental effect of the government's superannuation guarantee levy. In relation to the motion that this bill be read a second time, I take this opportunity to move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: "whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)expresses its concern that no provision has been made in the amended operating grant amount for 1996 for the allocation of new undergraduate places in Victoria; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)calls on the Government to ensure that the criteria underlying the allocation of new funded student places are applied consistently and equitably across the States and Territories".</PARA>
<PARA>Clause 6 of the bill amends the total operating grants available under section 17 of the Higher Education Funding Act to tertiary institutions in 1994, 1995 and 1996. The total grant for 1996 as provided in the bill includes the provision of $13.1 million for the creation of around 1,500 new undergraduate places in that year. I note the overall number of Commonwealth funded student load targets will, according to the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Higher education funding for the 1994-1996 triennium</EMPHASIS>, rise from a total of 403,290 effective full-time student units in 1994 to 415,850 units in 1996. These totals include both undergraduate and postgraduate places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note the government's view is that the university sector has reached or is reaching the limits of its growth. I will return to that point later. In November 1993, the then Minister for Employment, Education and Training, now the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), announced on behalf of the Commonwealth new criteria for the allocation of Commonwealth funded places. It is worth noting that this announcement was not made in this parliament, although very few announcements are now made in this parliament; it was made to a gathering at the University of Melbourne. The minister announced a principal criterion and a number of secondary criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal criterion is that the funded places should be directed to areas of high population growth and low tertiary education participation. The secondary criteria include links with industry, innovation in modes of delivery, the extent to which agreed school leaver targets and undergraduate targets have been met, equity group success rates, graduate employment outcomes and the quality of higher education provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These criteria at first glance look innocent enough, but in reality they are a recipe for expanded Commonwealth government control over the direction of Australian higher education and they are another stick to force or compel universities into producing not diversity but a certain sameness. It looks to the performance of universities and it looks to intrude into the ability of universities to manage their own destinies. These criteria favour those institutions which toe the Commonwealth policy line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The potential for intrusion is increased by the very vagueness of some of these criteria. What do we mean, for example, by `quality of higher education provision'? Does it mean good teaching, outstanding research or effective service to the community? What role will the government's university watchdog, the Committee for Quality Assurance in Higher Education, have in relation to the exercise of this criterion?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What of `graduate employment outcomes'? What is a satisfactory employment outcome for the purpose of allocating funding and growth amongst universities? Research into unemployment shows that graduates as a whole group do have a better chance of being in employment than other groups in the community. But in the current economic times we have the phenomenon of graduate garbage collectors, highly trained men and women&mdash;often with high expectations&mdash;who simply are not able to get work in an area that their training has prepared them for. Can it seriously be argued by the government that a university which simply turns out graduates who get jobs, regardless of what those jobs are, can in fact be doing well enough to earn it brownie points which can be used by the government to determine that it, university A, gets another 100 places while university B does not? My feeling is that such outcomes are the responsibility not of the universities that produce the graduates but of the economic circumstances into which they graduate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My overall point about these allocative criteria which influence provisions of this bill and the government's future funding directions is that the minister, in exercising his powers of determination under the Higher Education Funding Act, will have a greater capacity for arbitrary decision making than previously. This does not seem to me to be a prescription for consistent and equitable allocation of resources under the present funding model; nor will it give our universities the confidence to make long-term plans for their future growth, which I thought was the very premise of the government's triennium based funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will argue that it is the source of most university funding and as such these criteria are eminently justifiable, but this is also a government which has made much out of the desirability of fostering diversity in the higher education system. To quote the government's own 1993 higher education budget statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has put in place a funding and accountability framework which has increased institutional autonomy by providing maximum scope for each institution to allocate resources in accordance with its role and mission.</PARA>
<PARA>How things can change between August and January! Does the government not believe its own rhetoric or is it simply trying to exert greater control over the higher education system?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These allocation criteria fly in the face of the government's own lip-service to diversity and autonomy. Who is ultimately responsible for determining whether these criteria have been satisfied? The answer is simple: the central funding authority; that is, the minister and the department. Clearly, the government does not trust, nor will it allow, our universities to make the right decisions when it comes to their own allocation of resources. I would have to say that, on the other hand, I do not trust DEET to make the same decisions either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through a succession of ministers since the 1988 white paper, the government has developed a planned approach to higher education that runs completely contrary to local flexibility and autonomy. The annual profiles process where load targets and the government's priorities are put to the universities typify this centrally driven approach. This so-called negotiation involves universities going up or down five places in any faculty and in the end being told what they are allowed to do. There is no diversity there whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly concerned about the government's criterion for the meeting of school leaver and postgraduate enrolment targets. The imposition of school leaver quotas is a short-sighted and cynical attempt by the government to manipulate enrolment outcomes to hide the failure of its own policy. Throughout its term in office, it has encouraged an expectation of higher education amongst young Australians which the system cannot meet effectively under the present constraints imposed by the government. Rather than reap the whirlwind of its own up-beat rhetoric, the government is now seeking to force universities to set a proportion of school leavers or accept the financial consequences of not doing so, while at the same time actively discouraging as many school leavers as possible from pursuing the university option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In imposing this quota, the government is denying effective equality of access to higher education for the very large group of mature age applicants. This particularly affects older women in our community. It obviously has not learnt the lesson of its rightly failed attempt to discourage mature age students from participating by imposing double HECS on those wishing to undertake a second undergraduate qualification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1994, and I expect for the remainder of the life of this government, universities will be compelled to give priority treatment to school leavers even if their tertiary entrance scores may not necessarily be as good as those of mature age applicants who are competing for the same places. This seems especially absurd, as the evidence of 1994 first round offers indicates a drop in demand for undergraduate places across Australian higher education. This so-called affirmative action for school leavers runs counter to the government's own established principle of&mdash;to use the title of its 1990 discussion paper on higher education equity&mdash;a fair chance for all. It is not a fair chance for mature age students. It is also not a fair chance for kids who make a mistake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee and the National Union of Students, two organisations that often do not share a common view, have come out and criticised the school leaver quota and its effect upon the prospects of mature age applicants for university places. Unlike the government, the coalition sees academic merit alone as the basis for university entrance. All Australians, regardless of age or experience, who can satisfy requirements should have a chance to compete on equal terms for places available. As the government's higher education budget statement argues, there should be a balance between the autonomy of our universities in respect of their own affairs and the public's expectation that the taxpayers' dollar is spent effectively. It is clear that the government has yet to find the balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as mature age students, the second group that will be disadvantaged by this legislation are students who make a mistake and who wish to seek to transfer between faculties. They will be caught up in this as well. It will be much more difficult for a student who wishes to move from one faculty to another. This will mean that people will be locked into degrees that, after some experience, they may find themselves not suited to. It is contrary to logic and many will find it unfair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned at the outset, the bill provides funding for around 1,500 new undergraduate intakes in 1996, the final year for the 1994-96 funding triennium. These places represent the first application of the government's new allocative criteria. In this respect, the government report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Higher education funding for the 1994-96 triennium </EMPHASIS>makes interesting reading. The report, which I stress is separate from the bill, presumes to allocate these places between the states as follows: Queensland, 370; New South Wales, 350; Western Australia, 200; Australian Capital Territory, 30; and Victoria, none. The Australian Catholic University, which has campuses in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and the ACT, will receive 50 new undergraduate places for its New South Wales and Queensland campuses. Frankly, it amazes me that Victoria has done so badly in this carve-up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Higher education funding for the 1994-96 triennium</EMPHASIS> report states that the growth of funded intakes, undergraduate and postgraduate, plus funding for continuing students in the triennium for the two biggest states, New South Wales and Victoria, will be 2,020 and 995 places respectively, or a ratio of more than two to one. To add insult to the Victorian injury, the government proposes to make no new additional undergraduate places available to Victorian universities in 1996, compared to 350 for New South Wales, and has frozen Commonwealth funding support for new campus development at Berwick, for Monash University, and Lilydale, for Swinburne University. On the other hand, substantial new developments are being funded at Coffs Harbour, for Southern Cross University; and Albury, for Charles Sturt University. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government's principal allocation criteria for supporting new growth is based on regions which have high population growth and low higher education participation, I find it hard to fathom why New South Wales has received a larger share of new places, largely directed to the University of Western Sydney and these new campus developments, while Victoria, which also has a rapidly developing outer suburban region, has scored no new places in 1996 whatsoever. My colleague the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) will have more to say about this later. I know that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), who is at the table, does know where Berwick is, so I cannot suggest he does not. But if he goes out there and has a look at the rapidly changing population, the expansion and the demand he cannot help but think the outer eastern metropolitan region of Melbourne has some of the most educationally disadvantaged areas in Australia. Yet Victoria gets nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also interesting to observe that in the period 1986 and 1991, between two censuses, the rate of population growth in Victoria was 6.1 per cent. It outstripped that of New South Wales, which was 5.6 per cent. Could it possibly be that the University of Western Sydney, if I may use an example, just happens to serve an area that has been of more than considerable political importance to the government of late? The government's stark denial of any additional new undergraduate places to Victoria, a state which the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee has demonstrated to have the highest level of unmet demand in 1993, seems to me to have a certain political dimension about it. The Kennett government is no friend of the Keating government and, unlike its New South Wales counterpart, is not facing an election until the end of 1996. At any rate, Labor's treatment of the Victorian electorate, which gave it such generous support last March, seems cavalier and fickle&mdash;and we will certainly be making this point many times subsequently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One is tempted to ask whether the government has developed another funding formula whereby the number of university places to be allocated to a state or region are indirectly proportional to the short-term political benefit of the government. I know the minister keeps better records than the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly), but we would certainly like to know the exact basis on which these allocations were made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Melbourne University speech of the former minister, he indicated the government's belief that the limits of Commonwealth funded growth in the higher education system are being reached. It seems that it is time to turn the government's attention to developing opportunities in the TAFE sector. The implication of the minister's speech at the time for this bill and for future funding decisions is that the government can fund no more and, therefore, the university system can grow no more. That is a false premise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is still the capacity for provision of further university places, particularly undergraduate places, regardless of the government's capacity or willingness to fund them. The government should look at a fair and efficient way of giving universities the maximum opportunity to deliver as many undergraduate places as their resources permit them to offer, whether or not these places are funded by the Commonwealth. The coalition believes that using this capacity is an essential part of maximising access to higher education opportunities for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this end, I call on the government to review its knee-jerk opposition to the practical and sensible measure of allowing universities to charge Australian residents who are willing and able to pay full fees for available undergraduate places on campus and thereby allowing universities to use that revenue to improve the quality of their facilities and services. The government has allowed a measure of freedom for universities to charge for a range of postgraduate courses; it allows vice-chancellors to charge non-sponsored overseas students full fees. It now allows Australian students open learning and permits the Open Learning Agency, to charge fees for the courses offered under its umbrella. Quite frankly, it is hard to see the logical distinction between opening learning and university campuses or between overseas students buying an additional place and Australian students buying an additional place. This has been in the too-hard basket. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect of the bill on which I wish to comment briefly is the provision&mdash;clause 7&mdash;of an additional $51.7 million over the next three years to universities to assist them to meet their obligations under the government's superannuation guarantee levy. I draw attention to this provision as an illustration of the cost burden imposed on employers by the levy. It is fortunate for the universities that they have the government handy to pick up the tab for their additional expenses after 1 July. Many thousands of small business employers around Australia do not have the same luxury. We have been told by the government that this is not an impost on business; we have a bill here putting the lie to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I stated at the outset, the coalition does not oppose the financial and procedural provisions of this bill. This does not, however, remove our concern about the increasing centralism of the government's administration of higher education funding and resource allocation. I certainly call on the new Minister for Employment, Education and Training to take the opportunity to ask some very pointed questions of his portfolio advisers about the operation of the government's higher education funding mechanisms, and to consider the full consequences of the aspects of the government's policy which underlie this bill. I particularly invite the minister to provide to this parliament full details of the new decision making process which led to the somewhat baffling allocation of the new undergraduate places in 1996. </PARA>

It will increase student places and amend the act to promote greater efficiency and effectiveness in higher education and improve the operation and administration of the higher education contribution scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the history of the higher education sector in this country, we see some great contrasts between the major parties in the ways in which they have been able to promote and develop the sector. The 1983 election of this government marked the beginning of the most significant reform and expansion of higher education in Australian history. The system has become accessible to more Australians from a wider variety of backgrounds and more effective in meeting Australia's changing social and economic needs. The main thrust of the structural reform that has been instigated by the government has been to provide a national integrated and accountable higher education sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The record of the government as opposed to the coalition could not be more different. Between 1976 and 1981, while the coalition was in government, the total resources available to higher education institutions fell every year, whereas every year since our election we have increased the total resources available to the sector from just over $3 billion in 1983 to around $4 1/2 billion this year. Over the period 1983 to 1992, higher education enrolments increased by 60 per cent. We now have the second highest expenditure per student relative to per capita GDP in the OECD. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The equivalent of 12 new universities have been created since we came to office. Our tertiary education sector now has the highest share of total education expenditure in the OECD, some 36 per cent, compared with the OECD average of about 28 per cent. We now have some 580,000 people studying in our higher education institutions out of a population of 17.6 million people, giving a total population ratio of about 3.3 per cent. If we compare this with the United Kingdom where the percentage of population in higher education is 1.28 per cent, we can begin to see the level of commitment of this government to the education of its people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, not only has the size of the sector radically increased but also the way in which these resources have been deployed could not be more different than that advocated by the coalition prior to the last election. Money has not simply been thrown at the sector in the hope that it will do the right thing of its own volition. The creation of the unified national system by the government has opened up social and economic opportunities that the system could never have done in an integrated, accountable and accessible way if left to its own devices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has and will continue to set and implement agendas within our education system and will continue to take responsibility for this&mdash;one of the most fundamental areas of social policy. This bill builds on that record by increasing funding, providing more student places and with justified amendments to existing programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal with several amendments to this bill. First of all, there are more student places&mdash;an additional 1,500 undergraduate student places&mdash;requiring $12.9 million in 1996, increasing to $35.2 million in 1999. Five hundred places will be jointly funded with industry. This will bring the total of new places from 1989 to 1998 to over 100,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments also provide for supplementary superannuation grants to ensure that money is available to honour superannuation guarantee levy commitments. This will lead to $23.276 million being required in 1994, $12.931 million in 1995 and $15.518 million in 1996. The superannuation guarantee is a key part of the government's broader social policy in relation to the aged and the longer term commitment to ensure that our society provides for retired people in a way which will not severely impact on the taxpayers of the next century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Redundancy payments are also covered in the amendments. As the sector becomes more efficient and outcome oriented, institutions have identified excess staff. Assistance with redundancy payments is necessary to ensure that the changes that must be made are properly funded. This is essential to ensure that the workers affected by these changes, often through no fault of their own, are taken care of in a compassionate and understanding fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The open learning initiative, OLI, is also covered in the amendments. The open learning initiative will provide choice, flexibility and a previously unachievable economic and social freedom to many thousands of Australians. One of the more important things about the funding of OLI and the infrastructure it requires is that the nature of OLI means that there are few of the geographical constraints associated with conventional campus based education. There are many people within the electorate of Corinella who, as a result of this important initiative, will now have access to an education that otherwise would never have been possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has already committed itself to support the OLI by spending over $52 million in the 1993-95 period. These adjustments are required due to unforseen minor problems in the implementation stage. This bill will adjust the original funding estimates for each year while maintaining the overall funding commitment. I lived in country Victoria as a kid. If one lived at home in the country there was absolutely no access to higher education. Many people in the electorates represented by honourable members in this chamber will now have the potential, unheard of in the past, to access higher education and to improve their skills and employability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another amendment relates to the non-inclusion in a student's course load of work experience in industry. The Higher Education Funding Act 1988, as currently drafted, has led to differing interpretations as to what is encompassed in work experience in industry. Some more unscrupulous institutions have charged HECS to students when there was little or no cost to the institution in administering a work experience program. This has the effect of not only charging students for a service they have not received but also, by tying up student places, denying places to others who deserve them. This basically provides an unjustifiable windfall to the institution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amended section clarifies the situation. If work outside the institution is deemed to be work experience in industry, it is not considered to be part of the student's course load and, therefore, not subject to HECS. When institutions do not provide or pay for supervision of a student's work in industry, that work is not counted as part of a student's load. The amendment provides for guidelines to further assist institutions to classify work experience units. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another amendment covers the question of overseas aid students with New Zealand citizenship. Some overseas students from Pacific island countries are entitled to New Zealand citizenship and, therefore, are liable to pay HECS under the act. An administrative difficulty arises when such students are fully funded under an Australian International Development Assistance Bureau program. As AIDAB pays tuition fees on behalf of these students, it is agreed that such students should be treated as HECS exempt. This amendment exempts these students from HECS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another amendment relates to certain information being provided to students on enrolment. This amendment will tighten up the administration of the HECS scheme so that the risk to Commonwealth revenue is reduced. Requiring students to be provided with information will also reduce the risk of students who may have little experience with the tax system inadvertently avoiding tax. OLI students will be on the same footing as conventional students in terms of HECS payments. </PARA>

I want to contrast these changes, which are about finetuning a system which is working, to the situation of the Liberal Party.

Social policy would have been in the hands of vice-chancellors and we would have been leaping into the unknown in the higher education sector. Again, I contrast what we have done while in government with the record of the Liberal Party when it was in government. Under the Liberals there was stagnation in the sector and there were difficulties with outcomes. We had planned to be the clever country but in fact we were not clever at all. As I said, we await further developments as to the Liberal Party's policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise another issue regarding the future of the sector. As Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley)&mdash;speaking about access to courses across Australia and the allocation of places&mdash;said that we had historically high levels of participation and that we needed to ensure equity throughout Australia. He contrasted the situation of Victoria, which has the highest participation rate in higher education but the lowest population growth, with Queensland, which has a low participation rate and the highest population growth. I am sure that the shadow parliamentary secretary, the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), would be concerned about access to higher education in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue must be addressed, but the question of access and equity must also be addressed within the states. In growth areas such as mine and that of the honourable member for La Trobe many young people deserve access to higher education, but we represent areas where that has not been the case. There have been developments on that front, and I note the work of the honourable member for La Trobe on the Berwick campus for Monash University. There will be a campus for Monash University there. New technology will be used to open up access to, and to extend the existing boundaries of, that institution. We are making a start on ensuring that our region has access to higher education in the area. That is essential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of equity within the states is a key issue. Notwithstanding the start of the Berwick campus, more has to be done to ensure access and equity in growth areas. In looking at growth we have to make comparisons not only between the states but also between areas within states. Demographic changes and population growth in places such as Melbourne need to be taken into account when places are allocated within the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, the higher education sector in this country has expanded massively under a Labor government. It moved forward over the 1980s to confront the needs and aspirations of the Australian community. That, in itself, has brought problems. The unprecedented levels of growth have led to demand increasing at an even greater rate. We have to face that problem, but this government is eminently more capable of facing that problem than are those opposite. Our record in higher education, regardless of some of the problems that have occurred, is far superior to theirs. Over the last 10 years we have expanded the sector, set guidelines and produced outcomes which are in line with the needs of country. I feel that we are much better able to face the challenges of the 1990s. I am confident that we will face them and meet them. </PARA>

Our commitment in this area is clear; the neglect of those opposite in this area is also clear. I believe that as we move forward with an improved system and with the increase in places outlined in this bill we will be better placed to march up to the year 2000 with a better, competitive higher education sector.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes adjustments to HECS. I have no problems with the adjustments to HECS. I note that HECS was an ALP government initiative; it was not an opposition initiative. It imposes charges on students and the object of the exercise is to shift some of the public funding of university places to private individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that the benefits of education really serve us in three ways. Firstly, they serve to benefit the individual undertaking the education. Secondly, they serve to benefit the nation overall in that a higher educated and more literate population is better able to participate in today's society. Thirdly, they serve to benefit industry, business and commerce throughout the nation. All three factors should contribute to some extent. HECS makes that possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue I want to talk about in this bill is not explicit but rather implicit; that is, the division of funding from 1996 onwards to the various states. I have to say that Victoria has been well and truly raped. The honourable member for Corinella (Mr Griffin) talked broadly and widely about the terrific job this government has done in funding higher education places, yet he has abrogated his responsibility today to his constituents. They are the ones that are going to suffer as a result of the cut in growth to new funded places and the absolute cut to Victoria from 1996 onwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the statement the former Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley) made in November at the University of Melbourne means that from 1996 to the year 2000&mdash;or to the year 3000; who knows&mdash;there will be no growth funding for new places for higher education students in Victoria. That is an absolute nonsense. It is inequitable, it is unfair and it is discriminatory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Victoria is a proud state and has a proud history. Part of that pride derives from the fact that, over many years, long before the Commonwealth took over funding of tertiary education, Victorians spent their money privately and through state taxes to develop a substantial university network and a system of colleges of advanced education throughout the state of Victoria. They may not all have been put in exactly the right places and they may not all have been designed to do exactly the right things, but, by golly, Victorians put their money where their mouths were. They devoted money and assets to the higher education sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But now this government is going to make Victoria pay because it was successful in the past in building a university sector. That is not very fair. The shift by this government into technical and vocational education and training is appropriate. I have said that many times in this place and out of it. I have steadfastly fought for an increasing place in the sun for that sector of advanced education and that sector even within our school system because I believe we will be best served by concentrating resources in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what this government fails to recognise is that all of the funding for higher education need not come from the public purse. It can come from private individuals. It can come from industry. It can come from all sorts of sources. But because this government so</PARA>
<PARA>tightly controls the education sector through the profiling process and through the massive Department of Employment, Education and Training, we have a few people in Canberra determining whether or not students on the ground in my electorate will have access to university places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are shifting funds to technical and vocational education. The government is now saying&mdash;or at least the former Minister for Employment, Education and Training said&mdash;that we cannot afford many more additional new places in the tertiary sector. The problem is that Australians still want more places. Every year there are more Australians who want to go to university than there are places available. In 1993, approximately 35,000 young Australians were denied a place at university despite the fact that they had finished their schooling with qualifications that should have given them a place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why were they denied that place? Government funds are limited. I accept that we cannot keep asking taxpayers to fund students' university education forever. But we allow the universities some flexibility to charge full fees to overseas students. The rules as they stand at the moment say that a person who is born in Australia is disadvantaged. If you are one of the 35,000 who is unable to find a place, you do not go, that is it. You are out; you are finished; no university degree for you. There is no access to university for you to try to improve your education. You cannot even pay for the place. Even if you are willing to go out and work part time, if your parents have the money to support you, if you are willing to go to the bank and borrow the money, if you are willing to use HECS entitlements and turn that into students loans, you are unable to do that because the federal government says you cannot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You are disadvantaged because you are an Australian. Because you were born here and you hold an Australian passport you are discriminated against. If you were born in Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, China, the United States, England or Germany, you can go to university in Australia, but not if you are an Australian, not if you are one of 35,000 who missed out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is that fair or equitable? The government has got to be kidding. The honourable member for Corinella talked about equity and access. There is no equity without access. How can there be? The government brought in HECS. It allows the overseas students to pay full fees and requires Australian students to pay part fees but then stops at that point and says, `No more'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at Victoria because that is really what this issue is all about. Historically Victoria has supported the higher education sector. Now we are being discriminated against because we built universities and we built up university places. There are a number of significant points that relate to Victoria and relate to this issue that I hope the minister will take away from this debate and take into account when reconsidering the decisions made by the prior minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, unmet demand is higher in Victoria than it is in other states. But the former minister said that, notwithstanding that there was unmet demand, other states had priority because their participation rates were lower. I do not see the sense in that at all. In 1993 the unmet demand in Victoria represented approximately 15,000 of the 35,000 or 36,000 students who could not find places. Not quite half of the total number of students in Australia who wanted university places and could not get them were from Victoria. How are we going to fix that problem? We are going to say, `In 1996, there will be no more new places whatsoever'. All that will do is exacerbate the problem. We cannot legislate to tell people that they do not want to go to university. This is a free market, free enterprise democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that the participation rate is higher in Victoria than it is in other states. That is largely due to history. But that trend has continued. For decades, the participation rate in Victoria has been the highest. We are now, by government fiat, going to attempt to modify that. We are going to attempt to lower the participation rate in Victoria, artificially, by withdrawing funding. That is brilliant; there is no equity in it whatsoever. It makes absolutely no sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would maintain that the higher participation rate in Victoria reflects the occupational aspirations of Victorians. It reflects the fact that our young people have been brought up with the expectation that, if there is any opportunity to do so, they should make an attempt to go to university; they should make an attempt to further their education. Also, the range of occupations that is available in Victoria is different from what it is in New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia, Tasmania and South Australia. DEET in Canberra cannot determine by fiat that it will socially engineer Victoria to, all of a sudden, have a different range of occupations that does not require higher education degrees as qualifications for entry into the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Victoria pays more HECS so, on average, students in Victoria are paying more private fees to the federal government for university education than corresponding students throughout the nation. Victoria accounts for approximately 25 per cent of the national enrolments, which means that it pays approximately 25 per cent of the HECS fees; but only 21 per cent of the growth is funded to Victoria by the Commonwealth. That is inequitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the attention of the House to the fact that, since October 1982, the Victorian government has been prepared to put Victorian money into the growth of new places. In 1993, the Victorian government committed approximately $30 million and over the next five years it has committed approximately $120 million to state funded places in tertiary institutions. It is the only state in Australia to do that. How does the Commonwealth respond to that? It says that Victoria will have no new places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area covered by the electorates of Corinella and La Trobe has the lowest participation rate of tertiary students of any higher education district in Victoria. That has been true for some time. For the past 3 1/2 years, I have participated in a major battle to try to get a university campus in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One reason why students from this area are disadvantaged is that the location of existing universities results in transportation problems. It is very difficult to get to Monash or to the University of Melbourne or to La Trobe or to Swinburne from Cranbourne, represented by the honourable member for Corinella; from Berwick, which I represent; from the Dandenongs. Heaven help those trying to get to Deakin in Geelong! It is a long and difficult two-way trip every day. That is one of the proven reasons why people in these areas do not participate as fully in higher education as those from other educational regions in the state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We fought to have a new campus built in the centre of the growth region which students could get access to. In terms of the rate of growth in Australia, that growth corridor in the south-east of Melbourne is second only to that in the Gold Coast in Queensland. After a long and arduous battle, the federal government has agreed to have this new campus built; the state government has bought the land and it is under way. That is being done with capital funding of only $11 million, which has been capped by the previous minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether the minister at the table knows what $11 million will buy today in terms of a school building, but I can tell him that three years ago the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, now the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin), opened the third stage of the library at the Burwood campus of Deakin University. I happen to have built the third stage of that library, which was worth $4.3 million. So $11 million will not get us very far with new campus infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Monash is willing to spend part of its capital funding which is rolled in as part of its regular receipts from the Commonwealth. We are making every attempt to get industry to participate in that decision, to put in industry funds. Nonetheless, we desperately need reasonable amounts of starter capital. Monash has estimated that, to build a reasonable core for the university, with a library, administration building and enough classrooms and lecture theatres to make a decent start, it needs to invest about $30 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The location of this facility at Berwick is absolutely first-class. It represents a real first for Australia. The campus is adjacent to the brand new Dandenong College of TAFE which opened its doors late last year. Its first full year starts on 1 February. Eleven million dollars is only about a third of the total capital that we really need to make it work. Not only is this campus next to a TAFE college, but it is on a major national arterial road which has a set-down area right at the front of the campus. It is set on 158 prime acres in a beautiful location. Also, it is on the rail head. Students can get off at the Berwick rail station and walk directly to the campus in about five minutes. It is an excellent location which has everything going for it. It is in the centre of the second fastest growing region in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will have no equity in the growth corridor to the south-east of Melbourne, centred on Berwick, until we have access. We need more capital funding and we definitely need to have reversed the dictum of last November by the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) that there will be no new growth places in Victoria from 1996 onwards. We need to have that reversed because we expect that 1996 will be the first year of operation of the Monash campus at Berwick. There are many plans for a broad range of courses at that campus and there are many students looking forward to that opening day, but we need reasonable facilities and we need the growth places. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Monash is willing to transfer student load from its other campuses to Berwick in order to make this new enterprise work. I commend Monash for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the federal government and DEET to take that carefully into account, because that shift of full-time student load places from Clayton, Caulfield and Frankston is important. If Monash is willing to shift places to Berwick, we need a bit of Commonwealth help. Putting all of the growth funding in Queensland might serve some political end but it serves no practical end, no equity end, for disadvantaged students in the south-east of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To sum up, the problem I have with this bill today lies in what it does not say. I implore the minister to listen to my remarks and to make some response at some future time in the positive manner of which I know he, as a good Victorian, is capable. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, 9.85 per cent of Australia's population resides in the greater western region of Sydney; that is 1.6 million people. It is expected that the population will exceed 2.06 million by the year 2001. By 1996 the greater western region of Sydney will have approximately 30 per cent of the population of New South Wales and 40 per cent of Sydney's population. Nearly one-third of New South Wales school students attend schools in the greater west. Yet the people of the greater western region of Sydney still only have access to eight university places per 1,000 people compared to 32 places per 1,000 in the rest of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is doing something about this situation. This government established the University of Western Sydney in 1988 and since then has funded capital expenditure at the institution at much higher levels than funding for other institutions. We are now funding expansion of student numbers at UWS at an unprecedented level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It must be said, however, that the needs of a growing university are substantially greater than those of the well-established older institutions. As I have mentioned, this government, in recognition of these needs, has provided funding for very significant capital development of all campuses of the university under the previous project based capital funding of higher education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new system of allocating capital funding as a component of the operating grant is logical and sensible. It will enhance institutional autonomy and place the responsibility for institutional resource management decisions more fully in the hands of the institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For UWS there is a danger that capital allocation based on student load could halt that capital expansion of which we have been so proud. Under the roll-in system of capital grants, the University of Western Sydney will receive significantly less funding for capital development than it has received from the submission based, project by project funding over the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the government understands the concern of new, growing institutions and has established the capital development pool, the CDP. The University of Western Sydney will be allocated $2 million from the CDP in 1996 as part of a $6 million package from 1996 to 1998 in recognition of the continued high growth in enrolments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the Commonwealth will allocate over $4 million over 1995-96 to the university if the proposed multi-sectoral education facility at the former HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nirimba</EMPHASIS> goes ahead. Continued commitments such as these and continued recognition of the special needs of new, growing universities by this government will ensure that the University of Western Sydney continues to meet the needs of the people of the greater western region of Sydney. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to conclude by referring to the speech given earlier by the opposition spokesman on education, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge). He made an allegation that the funding levels for the University of Western Sydney were politically based because this was Labor's heartland. I find this rather amazing because the University of Western Sydney, Hawkesbury, is based right in the state electorate of Hawkesbury which is held by the Liberal state government by about 20 per cent. He also stated that Victoria would have got more funding than western Sydney if Victoria had an election pending, as New South Wales has. I think what I have said already shows quite clearly the special needs of the University of Western Sydney. It has grown from nothing only a few years ago and is now serving the people of that area who had a very low participation in tertiary education. It is also working very closely with the community at all levels and at all political levels as well. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

The honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) made a very full and good explanation of the reasons for the disquiet of the honourable member for Chisholm in relation to Victoria's tertiary education funding.

It is one of those amalgamation situations. If the honourable member for Macquarie would care to compare the number of places in tertiary education per head of population in her electorate with the number in mine, she would find that her electorate is indeed very advantaged.

He was until recently in the chamber and I had indicated to him that I was going to comment on that in my speech. He then informed me that the MPI immediately after question time today deals with his portfolio so he has to be absent for a little while.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a time when we had a debate about education in this parliament, where there was some to and fro, where there was not just a reading of set piece speeches and talking about parish pump issues, but that has long since gone. It died about the time of the appointment of the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) as the minister responsible for education. It has been a pretty sad debate in this chamber ever since; which is a pity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My background was education. It was all education, one way or another, before I came into this place. I have been interested in pursuing the issue as a member of parliament, both as a senator and as a member of this chamber because, in my view, there is nothing more important once one has addressed issues of national security and economic wellbeing than education. I can give lots of reasons for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Events throughout the world in very recent years&mdash;the movement towards democracy by previously heavily suppressed people, a movement that I certainly would not have foreseen in its rapidity&mdash;have come about by making people literate. I believe that if people are allowed to read and write, to get access to information, the human spirit cannot be suppressed. I know both the honourable member for Macquarie and the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh), who is at the table, will not disagree with my next comment either. I think the biggest mistake men ever made in the suppression of women was allowing them to become literate&mdash;it is a mistake that certain other countries are not making yet, but the time will come&mdash;because education really is the key to the expression of the human spirit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The terribly depressing aspect of what has happened both in education and in the education debate in this country in recent years, first under the Hawke government and now under the Keating government, has been the fettering of education and the moving towards suppression in an area that should be fraught of vitality. It was very depressing when the honourable member for Fremantle moved towards prescribing what universities should teach, when he as minister made certain value judgments in relation to where resources should be going, when he indicated a very strong preference for those who were concerned with technical aspects of solutions rather than theoretical aspects. I remember well that Vice-Chancellor Pennington, then chairman of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, had to point out to him that, for example, the cure for AIDS will be found through some very theoretical research of the very type that Minister Dawkins was then damning, not through technical devices. The attempt to fetter and direct universities in what is important, the limiting of access by students to post-secondary education in this country is a tragedy for such a young country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason this country's economy has done as well as it has in the world, and the reason therefore its citizens have done as well as they have, is that we have had&mdash;compared with other countries&mdash;through our history a reasonably literate and highly skilled population. It is nonsense to say that we cannot compete with countries with cheap labour when we have workers who, because they are skilled and literate and can therefore pick up skills more easily, can produce much more effectively and efficiently than uneducated `coolie' labour&mdash;no racist overtones intended&mdash;of other countries. </PARA>

I am of the generation which saw the education boom start, when tertiary education was no longer the preserve of just the rich&mdash;certainly my parents were not in that category; we were very ordinary folk indeed&mdash;when aspiration was what took you forward. The stifling of aspiration, the move to control in a variety of ways&mdash;including amalgamations, which particularly affected my own electorate&mdash;is a legacy we will live with for a long time. On another occasion&mdash;I could raise this matter under this bill because we are talking about tertiary funding&mdash;I shall say more about the subject of the structure we are stuck with at the moment and the problems that will inevitably come in the years ahead of us for educational output as a result. </PARA>

<PARA>That is a very misleading statement. It should have been that as many Australians as is possible under this government's restrictive policies should have access to higher education. If as many Australians as is possible had access to higher education, we would have tens of thousands more in the system right now. The words he left out are `as economically possible under this government's restricted access'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the record of education in Australia and the matter of access. Pre-1972, the system under which I was educated, we had a dual system&mdash;some free, some fee paying. We had Commonwealth scholarships, which paid all fees, and if people did not get a Commonwealth scholarship they could pay fees and attend university, with the possibility always that if their academic achievements were sufficiently good they could pick up one of those free places.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As soon as the free system came in, the University of Queensland was forced to introduce first year quotas.

However, the free education system led directly to the imposition of quotas and restriction of entry for first year students into the University of Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Treasurer to today's balance of payments figures, which show a current account deficit of $1.7 billion for the month of December. The worst recession in 60 years was brought about by the government in order to solve the current account deficit problem.

How does the Treasurer intend to fix the current account problem without causing another interest rate driven recession?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="144" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We get a one-month figure that is at the upper end of market expectations and the opposition calls on calamity. It is certainly true that the $1.7 billion figure for the month of December is at the upper end of market expectations, but that came after a series of figures which were running well below the levels for last year. One cannot just take one month's figures; they have to be looked at over a period. If we take the half year for this year against the half year for last year, we can see that we are doing slightly better than last year. The accumulated deficit for the six months to December 1992 was $8.86 billion. For the last six months to December 1993 it was $8.7 billion. So it is slightly less than it was last year. That is in a situation where the economy is growing faster.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said yesterday, the economy is expected to grow at 3 1/2 per cent per annum this year. Last year it grew at 2 1/2 per cent. We are looking at a slightly lesser current account deficit in the context of better growth performance by the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, in those circumstances, the figures on the current account are not cause for alarm. They should be a cause for some satisfaction in that we have been able to do better this year in absolute money terms, despite the fact that we have had faster growth of the economy. We have done better because we have had a 50 per cent fall in the net services deficit, which largely reflects increased tourism, and a fall in the net income deficit because of lower world interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This outcome is also very respectable in the circumstances that we face&mdash;that is, we have been growing at 3 1/2 per cent and the rest of the OECD area is growing at about one per cent. That is the comparison.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also trading with the Asian region, which is doing better than the OECD, and that is obviously a considerable help to us. But we have faced subdued world economic activity, and that is not a plus for exports. As a consequence of that, we have also had weak commodity prices. They are worse this year than last year. So, in those circumstances of reduced commodity prices, which are so important to our overall export performance, despite the ongoing broadening of our exports, we obviously face some problems. To have done better in those circumstances is commendable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important factor in our continuing overall growth of merchandise exports has been the fact that our elaborately transformed manufactures are continuing to grow strongly. A feature of the export scene in the last half a dozen years has been the growth of elaborately transformed manufactures. They have grown at 17 per cent in the last six months compared with the same six months of the previous year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite all these points, the questions which have been raised by the honourable member for Mayo are: does a number like this mean that we may find some constraint on growth because of the balance of payments factor and will the current account deficit prevent us from having the kind of growth which will get us to much lower levels of unemployment? It is certainly true to say that, as we continue to grow, we must expect that imports will increase. A faster rate of economic growth will give us a faster rate of growth of imports, particularly as business investment picks up because that is more import intensive. So we must expect that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, there is reason for optimism on the export side. We are looking at a world which is expected to increase its level of economic activity considerably in the next couple of years. The OECD forecasts are for growth in the OECD region to grow from 1.1 per cent in 1993 to 2.1 per cent in 1994 and 2.7 per cent in 1995. That is obviously helpful to our export performance. In this morning's newspapers, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics forecasts that commodity prices will increase over the next few years by some 17 per cent between 1993-94 and 1998-99. If that were to take place, just with the same volume, that would increase the value of commodity exports by some $8 1/2 billion.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a real depreciation because we have had reductions in our relative unit labour costs. Our labour costs relative to those of other countries have been falling. That has given us a real depreciation and, therefore, a real increase in our competitiveness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also had rapidly growing exports of manufactured goods, as I have mentioned. It is also important to realise that our debt servicing ratio&mdash;that is, our capacity to service our debt&mdash;has been improving quite rapidly in recent times. In 1989-90 that ratio&mdash;that is, the interest on foreign debt compared with total exports&mdash;was 21 per cent. In September 1993, which was the last figure I could find, it was 11.9 per cent. So the figure has almost halved in that time. That reflects lower interest rates here and elsewhere. It also reflects our improved export performance. So our capacity to service our debt has increased considerably.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, there are lots of reasons for optimism. Whether the balance of payments becomes a constraint will depend very much on us. If we pursue the right policies, we can ensure that it does not. The right policies mean that we have to maintain a low level of inflation; we have to maintain our improved international competitiveness and, if we can, improve on it; we have to improve productivity by a continued vigorous pursuit of micro-economic reform; we also have to improve our national savings performance and, if we do not do that, then, as investment grows and a savings investment gap opens up, we will be increasingly calling upon the savings of other nations, which will mean that we will be blowing out our current account deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have to improve our savings performance. That means we have to reduce the Commonwealth and overall public sector deficit so that we do not have so much public dissaving. We also need to improve private sector saving performance. I assure the House that the government will be working diligently to achieve all those objectives.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="149" SPEAKER="Lee The Hon M.J." NAMEID="MG4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="DOBELL" MINISTERIAL="COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS; TOURISM" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question and for his continuing interest in the postal services provided to his constituents. I am, of course, aware of the campaign which the Communications Workers Union has initiated and its claims that the government's decision to open up $250 million worth of Australia Post business to competition will result in 500 post offices closing. I am very disappointed that the CWU has launched this scare campaign, because it has had the simple effect of alarming members of the public&mdash;perhaps in the honourable member's electorate&mdash;and also causing some distress to some Australia Post employees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was intrigued that virtually every federal electorate included a number of the post offices that were on the alleged hit list of 500 post offices until I found out that the list was prepared by the CWU and not by Australia Post. I think we should realise that the CWU has confused two reform issues in its campaign. The first is that Australia Post has been seeking to restructure its retail post office network. That is the result of a five-year strategy being developed and the result of its trying to improve customer service. It has also been trying to modernise its retail network. In 1992 it had the agreement of the CWU for this retail post office strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the first issue. Australia Post has set out to modernise its network and to improve the locations of the retail post offices. Australia Post is introducing retail post office shops so that they are more attractive to consumers; they are at the right end of town so that more people are likely to spend money in them. That is something which will guarantee the further development of the postal network and improve the quality of services offered by Australia Post.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to putting Australia Post shops in more accessible locations, under this strategy Australia Post is also seeking to convert small unprofitable post offices into licensed post office operations. I know that has been a matter of some concern amongst members of the government. Australia Post has advised me that, firstly, if an official post office is being considered for conversion to a licensed post office, Australia Post is committed to maintaining the same range of postal services which are now available from the official post office; and, secondly, that conversion will only follow a detailed review involving unions, the local community, chambers of commerce and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure you, Mr Speaker, that Australia Post is committed to modernising and improving its network, not reducing it. I would suggest that the CWU could better use its resources. Instead of handing around material such as this, which I think some honourable members have received, it would do better to try to ensure that its members receive accurate information about the government's campaign. The second element of the reform process is that the government decided last November to allow greater competition for some of Australia Post's domestic mail services. That will affect about $250 million worth of business. Australia Post has indicated that it will fight to protect every dollar of that business, even though it will be exposed to competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people have incorrectly suggested that, as soon as Australia Post faces any competition, it will lose the business. That is just not borne out by the facts because today, before implementation of the government's decision of last November, 40 per cent of Australia Post's revenue already comes from services that are open to competition. So it is just selling Australia Post and its employees short if we assume that, if there is competition, Australia Post will lose the business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has demonstrated in its reforms in aviation and telecommunications that, by introducing competition, we can provide benefits to consumers&mdash;and I am sure that will be the case with Australia Post as well. Those who assume that Australia Post is unable to compete and who seek to prevent one of Australia's most successful government business enterprises from modernising and improving its services are not doing Australia Post or its employees any favours whatsoever.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today's balance of payment figures are a timely reminder of some of the trends in our trading performance. The Treasurer and I remarked earlier on other aspects of it, but I think it is worth recording that over the decade our exports of manufactures to east Asia have increased elevenfold&mdash;1,272 per cent to be precise. Work done by my department shows that our export performance does not worsen as the economy strengthens. We are likely to find that the people who have developed these markets now take the view that, having used export markets, particularly in the recession, to gain volume, even with smaller margins, they will not now forsake those export markets when we see a pick-up in domestic demand&mdash;that is, they will keep a relatively high proportion of their exports in those markets.</PARA></TALK.START>

Exports of elaborately transformed manufactures in the first half of 1993-94 were 17 per cent higher than for the same period the year before, which shows a continuing strength in our capacity to get into those markets and to actually service them.</PARA>

That is its lowest level for a decade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there has been, understandably and appropriately, concern in Australia about the level of our debt, the key thing is our capacity to service it. It is not so much the level that then matters as our capacity to service it, and it is that capacity which is improving as the proportion of our service costs to the exports of goods and services continues to decline. Having that come back to around 11.9 per cent of our goods and services proceeds I think is a very bull point for the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again this goes back to the kind of country Australia has become under this Labor government. Australia now has a high technology, export focused, open economy with dramatically reduced border protection, a free financial market, a good fiscal policy, a productive culture, a wages policy that is working, a low inflation rate and low nominal interest rates. This whole policy mix is now coming. It is producing a change in confidence levels in business that we have not seen for a long time. This is not because people think that the easy money days of the 1980s are back but because there is a real productive basis for going on into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the government's point of view we are going to go on and continue to improve the model we have been working with for just on 11 years.

The areas of the micro-economy such as electricity, gas supplies, infrastructure, transport are the areas which require continuing reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen great reforms in the areas of telecommunications, ports and wharfs. There have also been great reforms in the Commonwealth area of aviation. There have been dramatic changes to the seamlessness between the domestic and international carriage of passengers. It means that things like the development of a sensible electricity grid in eastern Australia, a free flow of gas and the opportunities to trade in gas on free and fair terms, and access to water at competitive prices will make the economy much better. That is why there is a role for the states and Commonwealth to do these things and to get them right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far the government has done quite well with, for example, the National Training Authority. We pulled together the six state TAFE systems to make a national system. Other areas of the micro-economy are going to be important. The government will be working on those. But obviously, in the coming few months, the government will be working on the labour market, the problems of long-term unemployment, regional development policy and industry policy to keep the efficiencies up to the economy to maintain the kind of growth which we have had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We take great heart from the new export culture in Australia and our export performance. We take great heart from the fact that the debt service component of the current account has come down dramatically, which means that Australia is in a position to better afford and service the debt which was acquired in the 1980s due to the fact that Australia was arriving at a position of complete uncompetitiveness by the early 1980s.

There are some very real dangers in selectively using OECD data to provide a snapshot of a country's performance as the approaching data collection varies considerably from one country to another and the results of any attempted comparisons are likely to be of limited value. Secondly, they have assessed 11 different environmental criteria to produce an overall score and ranking of environmental performance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I must correct the analogy of the honourable member for Cowper who said that, `. . . 37 "Chiefs" verges on the absurd and taints us as well as the Liberals'. I must confess that, in this particular environment, we do not see the opposition frontbench, and particularly its leader, in the context of Chief Sitting Bull. If we are going to draw analogies, we see him more in the context of General Custer, whose last words&mdash;which probably well apply to the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;were reputed to be, `We have seen better times than these in the 7th Cavalry'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister. He knows that Australia has one of the highest rates of suicide in the world, particularly amongst males aged 15 to 19 years. The government has no strategy to give any hope to parents and youth who are confronting this waste of life. Why should we not develop a comprehensive national strategy to reverse this human tragedy?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that there is a concentration of premature deaths from suicide in the age group mentioned by the honourable member for Mitchell. That certainly is regrettable. It is a matter that the government should and does take an interest in. It is one of the issues referred to by Brian Burdekin in his recent report on mental health. This report is currently under consideration by the government, which will be consulting with the states over the next several months and producing a comprehensive report by the middle of this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons for suicide are very complex. We often think about young people as living their lives in many ways free of pressure and stress, but for many young people their youth can be a very unhappy period. The reasons for that are complex; there is no simple answer and no answer that can be separated from a broader approach to government policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We care for a very large number of young people through the supported accommodation program and the associated programs for young homeless people. Those programs have been reviewed and evaluated. We are currently formulating proposals which will be the subject of the next five-year agreement with the states, which will be signed by 1 July next year. Those efforts, which are very important, also need to be linked to efforts made, for example, in the field of mental health, which was particularly the subject of Brian Burdekin's inquiry. Issues such as this are complex, and the government needs to address them in a way that produces specific strategies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons for suicide are profound and difficult. One cannot expect&mdash;even after we implement the results of the Burdekin report, sign a new agreement on supported accommodation and work with the states in a whole range of areas&mdash;that ultimately we can do more than have some impact on a problem which has very deep roots within modern communities.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter of public importance is about unemployment because unemployment is an issue that touches almost every Australian family. Yesterday we had the government's assessment of unemployment and we had a self-congratulatory performance by the Treasurer (Mr Willis), in which he said that the Australian nation had a magnificent future awaiting it. This magnificent future has a social dimension that excludes the unemployed of Australia. Yesterday, in the Treasurer's words, we were told:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We expect that the participation rate will remain at somewhere where it is at the moment, at around 63%, which means we're not going to, despite that higher employment growth, this year, make any further substantial headway on the unemployment rate, which was forecast in the budget to be around 10.75%.</PARA>
<PARA>So that is it. There is no change and no hope. There is nothing for the next 12 months. We should have a look at the dimension of the unemployment problem in Australia. We have 937,000 people unemployed. We have 344,000 people who have been out of work for more than a year and 187,000 people who have been unemployed for more than two years. What the figures do not show is that we also have 586,000 people who could find only a few hours work a week. We have 160,000 people who have given up, and we have nearly half a million kids who live in families in which both parents are unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA>There are other dimensions of this problem, as I have mentioned. One such dimension is underemployment. The Bureau of Statistics has a very broad definition of unemployment. A person has to work only one hour a week to be defined as employed. An underemployed person is someone who works part time but wants to work more or someone who is working full time but is not working full-time hours; for example, he has been stood down or is working short hours because the work is not there. In August 1993 the ABS reckoned that there were 586,000 people underemployed, which is 6.8 per cent of the labour market. That figure compares to 3.8 per cent after the 1982-83 recession. So that adds to the dimension of the tragedy of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is hidden unemployment, which the Bureau of Statistics has been looking at recently. The hidden unemployed are people who are able to work but did not meet the ABS's strict criteria, who are actively seeking work but are not able to start in the next four weeks or who, for a whole lot of reasons, have given up. The ABS looked at hidden unemployment from September 1989 to September 1992. In that time, the figure for discouraged job seekers had gone up from 76,000 to 145,000. In that 12-month period we can assume that figure has gone up by another 10 per cent, which makes the best estimate 160,000. If we add those figures together&mdash;937,000 unemployed, 586,000 underemployed and 160,000 who have given up&mdash;18 per cent of the Australian labour force is currently affected by underemployment or unemployment. That figure compares to 13.7 per cent after the last recession. So the magnitude of what is going on has to be looked at in that broad sense. If the government does not look at the matter in that sense, it is not being honest with itself about what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increased magnitude of the problem is not matched by an increased response. The very long-term unemployed have not got much attention. Three years ago there were 67,000 long-term unemployed people; today there are 187,000. That is an increase of almost 200 per cent. They are people who have been out of work for two years. What hope have they been offered in the last couple of months from the wonderful economic miracle that awaits us? None, there is no hope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures are actually worse than that. I noticed in a report that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) gave in caucus this week that he used a figure of 400,000 long-term unemployed. I thought that was strange as it was a lot higher than the 344,000 that the ABS has produced. I also remember the former Minister for Employment, Education and Training softening us up by saying that the figure for long-term unemployed people could go higher than 400,000 this year. Let me tell honourable members that that has happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only recently the government released its newstart recipient numbers. People have not paid much attention to this till now. Newstart recipients are the people that the government pays every fortnight because they have been out of work for more than 12 months. As at December the government was paying 451,000 people a newstart allowance. So the figure of 400,000 that the Prime Minister is using is just a sleight of hand. By the government's own figures, it pays 451,000 people who have been out of work for 12 months. That was the position in December, and that figure has gone up every month for the last two years. They are the long-term unemployed. That is heading inextricably towards the 500,000 mark. Others know this. ACOSS knows it. A couple of weeks ago ACOSS was talking about a figure of 450,000. ACOSS knows this because it has to deal with these unemployed people. It sees the social consequences of what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The social consequences are great. EPAC looked at unemployment last year and put out a paper on the social consequences of unemployment. It looked at divorce, marriage and crime. It reckoned that if the employment rate was taken down to 6 1/2 per cent there would be 800 fewer divorces, over 4,000 more marriages and 20 fewer homicides. That is the cost that Australia today is paying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AMA has had a look at unemployment as well; in fact, it has released several papers on the social cost of unemployment. What has to be understood about the social cost of unemployment is how it affects the individual. The AMA has been very good at this. Men and women have a significantly worse health status if they are unemployed. The mortality rate is 17 per cent higher for males if they are unemployed. Unemployed men have a 53 per cent higher rate of smoking, 50 per cent more doctor visits, a 57 per cent higher incidence of high blood pressure, 250 per cent more mental disorders and 68 per cent more bronchitis and emphysema. Unemployed women have 42 per cent more serious chronic illness, 35 per cent more hospital admissions, 80 per cent more outpatient visits and a 43 per cent higher rate of smoking. Twice as many people who are unemployed have skin disease, nervous disease and emotional disorders. That is the social cost of Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AMA went further and said, `Okay. Are they sick because they are unemployed or are they unemployed because they are sick?'. The AMA could not explain the excess sickness by pretending that unemployment does not affect sickness. There is overwhelming evidence that the social consequences of this today are as the AMA states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is crime as well. In the last few days we have had reports from the Australian Institute of Criminology expressing its concerns. Honourable members should listen to what Professor Chappell says on this matter. It is fairly chilling. He has written:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost of crime in Australia is very low compared with the cost in the United States and some other countries.</PARA>
<PARA>He also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our fear as criminologists is that two or three decades of continued relegation of more than 300,000 Australians to long-term unemployment may put us at risk of crime problems closer to those of the US . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is the future Australia potentially faces. Given the magnitude of that problem, we would expect a national crisis. Back in early September the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), who is at the table, made the odd foray into talking about employment. He recognised the problem. He said that we have to get economic activity and targeted job creation going and we have to address the particular needs of the long-term unemployed. He said that that was what the employment white paper was about and that the government would respond later that year. That was in 1993. The way things are going, it will be late 1994 before we have anything on this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are nearly a year into this electoral cycle and what have we had? A report. When are we coming up with some results? In May. And how long will they take to have any effect? At least six months. So we are talking about nearly two years of inactivity before we get any results on what is our most serious social problem in this country&mdash;two years of inactivity related far more to the political cycle than anything to do with the needs of the long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition senators questioned representatives of the minister's department in the Senate estimates. They were asked, `What are you doing for the long-term unemployed?'. All they could point to, in a similar self-congratulatory way that we saw yesterday from the Treasurer, was an expansion in labour market programs. They said, `For the long-term unemployed, we have a 43.6 per cent success rate, which is not bad'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me tell the chamber what that success rate means. It means that three months after people have done the training program they are either put on another training program or they find a job, regardless of whether it has anything to do with DEET training or not. Honourable members who have talked in their electorates to people who are on this training merry-go-round will know what it is like for people to constantly go from one training job to another. That is a success for DEET. We heard from the Prime Minister that after the election these people would not be forgotten and that the great hand would reach behind and pick them up. The only hand that has reached behind them yesterday reached into their pockets to slug them with an extra petrol tax. These people were expecting tax cuts, but they did not get them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response to this matter has been pathetically slow. The response to this has everything to do with the timing of the next election. If those opposite genuinely wanted to do something about this problem, they could have easily done it in a 15- to 18-month time scale. It does not take 15 to 18 months to do what the majority of people acknowledge needs to be done. It does not take 15 to 18 months to get DEET working well; to get labour market programs focused; to find out what is working and what is not; and to cut out the dead wood. There is no evidence that that is happening yet, and we will not hold our breath. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is nice to know, though, that there are some areas of growth. During the last three years there has been a 60 per cent increase in the staff of the CES. In one sense, that is understandable. But that has come from people who have been relocated from other departments. Other departments have had great exercises in cutting their staff numbers; they have shuffled them all off to DEET. The system under which we work in DEET is so rigid and inflexible that we have ratcheted up the staff to the point where they are stuck. It may very well be that, if we find the needs are not there or we find there are alternatives to DEET&mdash;which have been suggested&mdash;we will not have the ability to ratchet down and we will be left with an inexperienced, vast work force with very little to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look at the sorts of ideas that are being floated around by the government. Everyone knows what has to be done to achieve any real effect. We do not deny that the long-term unemployed have to be kept in touch with the labour market. That is economically and socially sensible. But in the end, unless the government has the guts to make some genuine industrial relations changes and to implement wide-ranging micro reform, there will not be much effect. Last year, EPAC said that we could increase GDP by 12.7 per cent if we finished micro reform. Everyone forgets that in the end the key&mdash;I have not heard from the Labor Party about this&mdash;is investment. If we look at this recession compared with the last recession, business investment in the last recession was up 23.9 per cent. This recession it is down 8.3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will now hear the government's response. We will hear a predictable mixture of self-congratulatory economic news such as `We're doing all we can' and a misrepresentation of what we took to the last election. But the Australian public knows that things are not right and it knows that government members are sitting on their hands. Government members can run and can misrepresent, but we will not allow them to hide. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the opposition for the opportunity early in this session of parliament, when I have new portfolio responsibilities, to address this issue. I say at the outset that the question of unemployment is the most important issue facing this economy. Whilst there has been some recent encouraging news, the level of unemployment in this country is still far too high and more needs to be done. I believe that more can be done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us just get some perspective on the position, because it is important to understand the difference between the challenge facing us coming out of this recession as against that coming out of the last recession. In the 10 years that this government has been in office there has been a 25 per cent increase in jobs. We have seen 1.6 million jobs created in this economy in that time. So let there be no talk about us not being able to create jobs. The problem we face&mdash;it is unique to the postwar settings in this nation&mdash;is that in the same period that saw employment grow by 1.6 million jobs we saw unemployment grow by 230,000 positions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have in this economy a unique position of jobs growth but, at the same time, unemployment growth. There are two important reasons for this position. The first is the increase in the participation rate. Because we have created jobs, more people are encouraged back into the work force. When we inherited office&mdash;when we won office&mdash;in 1983 the participation rate was three percentage points lower than it is today and almost four percentage points lower than was achieved in the late 1980s. Every one percentage point increase in the participation rate absorbs 88,000 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact of the matter is that we have encouraged, in a way that the opposition was never able to do in its reign of government, many more people&mdash;particularly women&mdash;back into the work force. That is why they have supported us. They recognise that, in the development of growth, the sharing has to recognise all sectors of the economy, not just the traditional ones. So the growth in participation is an important reason why the unemployment rate has gone up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important reason the unemployment level has gone up is that the economy has achieved a mismatch of skills. There is a difference between the skills now required of a restructured economy versus those available in the work force. Again, the reason for that is that for the first time we saw the need to integrate this economy in its industrial development. We did not just rely on export earnings coming off the farm or out of the quarry; we did something to convert them before they left our shores. For that to happen, we, just like any developed western economy, required a position where the demand in the work force was for more skills rather than unskilled labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, in this economy, the training dimension to meet that demand has lagged behind. Certainly in policy settings the government has made some important contributions towards ensuring that assistance is given in that respect. Examples include the improved retention rates in secondary schools; increased places in universities; and going to the states and putting pressure on them to get a national approach to vocational training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this mismatch of skills, we require a solution this time around. It is not just a question of economic growth but, as we say on this side of the House, economic growth plus&mdash;the plus being the targeting, the focusing and the development of programs that can equip a work force and people who in other circumstances would be unattractive for employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one can doubt the importance of economic growth in this equation. I have indicated that our approach requires us not just to rely on economic growth but to do more than that. We should not forget the significance of economic growth itself. I remind the House that the green paper which dealt with restoring full employment in the economy made a very important observation. If we are to have economic growth at 3 1/2 per cent for the rest of this decade, then the level of unemployment by the end of that decade will fall to around seven per cent. If we can get it to 4 1/2 per cent, however, the unemployment rate will be at five per cent. So whilst growth is not the only solution, the reality is that without growth we are not even in the game. Therefore, an important part of the strategy has to be the development of policies that not only promote economic growth but also sustain it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why the solution to the unemployment question cannot simply be an approach that derives from one portfolio area of interest; it has to be integrated across portfolios. The government has recognised this need because, in developing the green paper as a direction in which we might head, it has also had the regional development task force report and it is also committed to an important industry statement. These statements will be brought together in the next couple of months to provide the way forward and the solution for this at the moment seemingly intractable problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Economic growth is the key, but we have to recognise that economic growth will not make employment for those long-term unemployed groups in the community, the ones that are most seriously disadvantaged and the ones that will not be picked up quickly in the response. We have to equip them with the means by which they can become more attractive to employers when the recovery picks up. It is for that reason that we have identified not just the long-term unemployed but those at risk, which can include the young kids who are not interested in staying in school because they cannot see a future; they are not interested in getting into training. These are the people who need special attention. I agree that, if we are not going to address their problems, that will add to the social dimension of difficulties that this economy could face, such as the rising crime rate and the breakdown in family values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I want to make is that there is a social and an economic dimension involved in the response. Whilst it is nice to hear the shadow minister for education, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge), on the other side of the House talk about all these nice things, it is very interesting that whenever the Liberal Party has to actually come forward with a solution the social dimension and the nice rhetoric are forgotten because its policy solutions provide no innovation, no direction and no ability to deal with those issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did the Deputy Leader of the Opposition have to say about the green paper on unemployment? In a paper that was circulated to his shadow cabinet colleagues, he goes through the issues that are contained in the paper. He goes through some analysis. In part, he makes the same high-sounding phrases. But, in the end, his conclusion reads:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe it could be expensive. We should be looking at whether we can get better efficiency in that area. But it is easy to get that efficiency if all we are going to do is to drive the economic dimension and not try to equip the people to deal with the social dimension as well. I believe, and this has certainly been my experience in my electorate, that the CES officers are very helpful individuals. At times they have to operate with conflicting dimensions of where we are trying to place people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the important areas that I will be looking at&mdash;and I know the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon), who will follow me in this debate, is spending important time on this issue at the moment&mdash;is more effective mechanisms for delivering existing programs and making them work better. In addition to that, we have also said that we are prepared to consider further resources in the context of the issues that surround the notion of the job compact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the notion of the job compact comes the concept of mutual obligation. For this government's part, I am very attracted to the direction that says that, if we as a government are prepared to put additional resources in to try to solve this problem, there is also an obligation on the part of industry and the recipients to play their role in meeting their obligations. I believe that is an interesting development. It is an important part of what has come out of the green paper. It will be a significant dimension of the follow-up discussions that I will be having in the next couple of months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would not like to leave the House believing that the extra assistance will be focused on only the long-term unemployed. I believe they need particular attention. I believe they are disadvantaged because they have not had the opportunity to keep up with where the training direction is going. They have not had the work experience. Their self-confidence is down and they will require heavier costing responses not just because of issues associated with wage subsidy but also because, importantly, we will have to develop case management approaches with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not accept the notion that economic growth can look after the rest. The important focus needs to be on the long-term unemployed and those seriously at risk. But we need a response and a solution that also recognise the need to continue to skill the work force and to underpin the direction of structural change, which we have been responsible for overseeing and implementing so as to make the economy more competitive. As the recently revised forecasts have shown, we have made progress this year with 116,000 new jobs. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the opportunity of supporting the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge) in this discussion before the House about the continuing tragic level of unemployment in Australia. This Keating government is almost into its second year. The unemployment crisis that we have at the moment has existed since Labor came into power in the early 1980s. It has overseen a high level of unemployment for the past 10 years. It is no good this government blaming anything else. It is no good this government blaming the cyclical economic activity around the world which it has no control over.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has been in power long enough to realise that many of the programs the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) has just been speaking about have not achieved the results the government was looking for. Why has the government not looked further at enhancing those programs, or linking those programs to other reforms that should&mdash;and we know will&mdash;alleviate the tragic unemployment problem? We talk about the high unemployment levels and about the long-term unemployed, but let us remember that without employers there cannot be any employees. The point that has been lost sight of in this debate is that the government has not focused on the people who are out there in the community providing real jobs for our unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So where are we today? The December unemployment figure was 10.7 per cent, down 0.4 per cent on the previous month. It will be interesting to see the January figures next week. In my electorate of Lyne, the Port Macquarie unemployment figure in December rose by  0.7 per cent. In Taree it rose by 0.6 per cent. Regional unemployment, therefore, is still too high. It is not being affected by the programs that the government has in place at the moment. Only two months prior to that we saw the worst seasonally adjusted unemployment level in Australia's history, 11.2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about what the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins), had to say in his opening address on budget night in August last year? I quote from his budget speech which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The greatest issue facing our nation is how to provide jobs for our fellow Australians. Too many are now out of work. Too many have been out of work for too long.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The primary objective of this budget is jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>Really, the primary objective of that budget was to raise taxes&mdash;taxes on the jobs of ordinary Australians. This government has continued in that vein. It has not addressed the real issue. The former Treasurer nominated jobs as the key issue, but since this government was elected it has used all the sleight of hand tricks and the smart mouth sayings of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to evade and not address the issue of unemployment in Australia, particularly the issue of the long-term unemployed. I will reiterate the statistics that were used by the first speaker in the debate on this matter of public importance today about the long-term unemployed. The tragedy we face today is the people who have been out of work for over 12 months, who face at this stage, with the programs this government has in place, little prospect of finding employment. Unemployment has risen from 444,386 to a staggering 451,022 people. Now, nearly half of all the unemployed are considered to be long-term unemployed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is absolutely unbelievable. As I said at the start of my address, this government has been in power for 10 years and has not been able to come to terms with the tragic situation in Australia. What are the government forecasts?  We listened to some very interesting words from the current Treasurer (Mr Willis) yesterday, who talked about a `conjuncture of events'. His forecasts are these: his revised forecast for growth, 3.5 per cent; his revised forecast for inflation, two per cent; his revised forecast for investment, 4.25 per cent; his revised forecast for interest rates, remaining low; his revised forecast for unemployment, 10.75 per cent&mdash;what it was in the budget. On top of improved growth figures on what was forecast, there are better inflation figures than forecast and better investment figures but still the same unacceptably high level of unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has the government done? What are the labour market programs that the minister was talking about? I am sure we are going to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon) shortly. We must admit that, as part of the policy to address unemployment, some of the labour market programs are important&mdash;but not by themselves. We have seen labour market programs over the years, such as wage subsidy schemes. At the moment they last six months. What happens to the majority of those people who have been given employment under wage subsidy schemes at the end of the six months? Most of them go back on the unemployment queues. They do not get real long-term jobs out of it. They go along to apply for a job, but six months training or six months work experience is not enough. Anybody on the government benches who has been an employer&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is exactly right. If there were, they would realise that six months training, six months work experience, is not enough. It should be at least 12 months. What about the job creation schemes? They are fantastic for injecting government funds into infrastructure spending. They provide short-term prospects, short-term jobs. But what is the prospect of work at the end of those job creation schemes? There is none. The people who have participated in those job creation schemes are back on the unemployment queues. Admittedly they have had work for a short period, but who has paid for the work? It has been the taxpayer, not the private sector. It has not been generated by growth. It has not been generated by profits or export income. The taxpayer has paid for those schemes. Those people who have been employed in those schemes are back on the unemployment queues at the end of those schemes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The training schemes are fantastic&mdash;we have the best trained dole queues that Australia has ever seen&mdash;but they are not focused correctly. The minister just admitted that the training schemes are not focused in the right areas. We are training people to apply for jobs. We are training people to do things they do not want to do. We are not giving them traineeships. I have an industry in my electorate that employs in excess of 300 people. It manufactures components for the automobile industry in Australia. They were looking for a tradesperson to do a particular job. They searched Australia and could not find one. They had to convince a tradesperson to migrate from England to fill that position. It is a sad indictment on this government that, after having been in power for 10 years, we have not got those trained tradespeople. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister admitted that the retention rates of high schools are higher, that there are higher levels of tertiary education participation. That does not matter because there are no jobs at the end of that training for those people; there are no jobs at the end of that education process. What do we find at the other end of the scale? We find that we have not got the trained tradespeople in this country to assist in the manufacturing industries that we are trying to develop. Again, it is a sad indictment on this government. The government, on the other side of the argument, has maintained a large number of impediments to the private sector for employment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">) (3.29 p.m.)&mdash;As with his leader in this debate, the last speaker from the opposition, the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), demonstrated an appalling lack of vision and understanding in regard to the real issues. It is interesting that whilst the opposition continues to bleat about what it believes to be a lack of activity by the government, we have yet to see from the opposition any coherent policy response at all around any issue, let alone the labour market issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only input that we have had from the opposition in relation to labour markets and the question of unemployment has been the statements which have been made by the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), who is sitting at the table, and the shadow minister, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), who opened this debate. First, it is perhaps worth looking at what the shadow minister had to say in his response to the green paper. When the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) responded he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a band-aid approach which does little or nothing to create sustainable work for the unemployed: only a thriving and competitive economy, based on strong and sustained growth in productivity and investment, will guarantee that over time.</PARA>
<PARA>What does the shadow Treasurer say? In a press release headed `Coalition will fight against the jobs levy', he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only constructive way to get the long-term unemployed back into the work force is to improve Australia's economic performance.</PARA>
<PARA>Well, boohoo! There is not one commentator in Australia who does not believe that a very important factor in improving the job opportunities in Australia is to increase economic growth and to improve economic performance. But that is one part of the scenario. The key word from the shadow Treasurer is `only'. He says it is the only constructive way. `Only' is the word he uses in his press release. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest&mdash;as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said during question time&mdash;that what we are seeing from the opposition is a policy vacuum. Opposition members are in a void. They do not have any adequate responses to these great human issues. The government has acknowledged for some time the central importance of addressing the question of employment and unemployment to this government's social economic agenda. The government is not running away from the issue; it is addressing it full frontal, warts and all. It is prepared to examine all of its policies that it has put in place to address the issues hitherto. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst opposition members acknowledge that, as far as they are concerned, the only way to address this issue is through the mechanisms of the free market, they have no real vision about the way in which labour market programs relate to the importance of getting long-term unemployed people in particular back into the work force. What are they suggesting?  Are they suggesting that those people who might unfortunately be unemployed for 12 months more should just take the punt and rock on down to the local sheetmetal worker who has got a vacancy and expect to get a job because they have been 12 months long-term unemployed? Opposition members know&mdash;or are supposed know&mdash;how the market works. They know, as the Prime Minister and the previous Treasurer, the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins), said during the budget debate last year, that this government is about helping people up. What we are proposing to do and what we have done hitherto is look at ways to equip those people who are long-term unemployed with a better than even chance to get opportunities in the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had programs which have been very successful. Even the previous member who spoke in this debate acknowledged the importance of those programs, yet his shadow spokesperson, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Chisholm, came in here this afternoon and spoke in quite concerned terms about the needs of unemployed Australians. We acknowledge those needs; we do not walk away from them. Instead of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition making a constructive contribution to the debate, instead of giving us some propositions which he thinks might be appropriate to assist in the rehabilitation of those people who are unfortunately unemployed, instead of assisting in the debate by putting up proposals which might in fact help to get people back to work, the only blithe contribution he was able to make was, `We'll wait for economic growth'. It is just not enough and no reasonable observer of the situation in the Australian labour market accepts that it is enough. This government does not accept that it is enough. The green paper process, which the minister spoke about during this debate, is one very important part of getting a reasonable response to addressing the needs of unemployed Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would be aware, the Labor Party caucus is most concerned that unemployment and employment opportunities should be seen as a core of this government's social economic agenda. As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, there is a committee, which is jointly chaired by the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) and the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan). It has been travelling around Australia taking submissions from people about the way in which ordinary Australians feel about the question of unemployment. It has been very important to the contribution to the debate within our Labor Party caucus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer, we are not in a position to say that we can wave a magic wand and, hey presto, resolve the problem. What we are saying is that the concerns of these poor Australians who are unemployed need to be addressed in a coherent way, in a way which is constructive, in a way which addresses their needs, not in a way which just blithely says, `Let the market determine the outcome for their plight'. It is not appropriate to adopt that sort of attitude. I say this for the information of the honourable members opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the nature of those people who are unemployed, I quote what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on one occasion said in an interview on the ABC television news on 13 January. The announcer said that the opposition members claimed that `they were not the right sorts of jobs'. The honourable member for Chisholm said, `It is women who found the jobs, not men'. I am not quite sure what he meant by that. I am not sure what the female members of his caucus think about that sort of statement but I suggest to someone who is supposed to be soft and fuzzy in terms of the opposition, who is supposed to have some appeal to the community, that he understand that women are a very important component of the Australian labour force. They should not be denied access to the labour market. We should not decry the fact that women are able to get access to jobs within the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just say that we must understand the nature of the labour market and understand the nature of those people who are unemployed. It is important that we recognise the plight  that these people are in. Young people are the largest group of unemployed persons. Twenty-one per cent of unemployed people are aged between 20 and 24 years. Forty per cent of all long-term unemployed are between 20 and 29 years of age. Sixteen per cent of unemployed people are born in countries where English is not the first language. These groups constitute 45 per cent of the long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They place a particular burden on this government and on the community. There is no point in the opposition asserting that young people constitute an important component of the long-term unemployed and that people from a non-English speaking background constitute a huge component of the long-term unemployed without the opposition accepting a responsibility to put programs in place which will give those people an opportunity to compete equitably and equally in the labour market. That requires us to develop and further develop successful programs which we have had in place for some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what the process of policy review is about. It is accepting that the programs which are currently in place could work better; it is accepting that the delivery mechanisms which are in place could work better; it is accepting, as this government has done, that there is a need to improve the delivery of employment programs. That is why we have adopted the approach towards the Commonwealth Employment Service, which I might say has been ahead of the green paper debate, and why we have perceived the need for change in the way we deliver services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the shadow minister can quietly admonish the CES for what he believes is its role, let me say the CES has adopted an approach over recent months which is very important  to ensure that those people most in need in the labour market get opportunities. It has put in place a restructure of the organisation and policies which will improve the responsiveness and flexibility of the labour market programs, develop volunteer and work experience opportunities for long-term unemployed and introduce, for example, account executives to pursue vacancies and liaise with industry and employers. These are all very important changes. It is very important that we acknowledge the crucial role of the employment services and get people access to jobs for job vacancies. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill reflects the continuing commitment of this government to securing legitimate title to traditional lands on behalf of the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory. The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 provides a mechanism whereby traditional Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory referred to in schedule 1 of that act may be granted to Aboriginal land trusts to hold title on behalf of Aboriginal people. Since the act came into operation in 1977 a total of 57 separate parcels of land have been scheduled under the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of this bill would be to bring within the schedule to the Land Rights Act that area of land which is the subject of the Wampana land claim. The Northern Territory government, the Central Land Council and Gambamora Industries Pty Ltd have entered into an agreement which settles that land claim. As part of that agreement the Northern Territory government agreed to request the Commonwealth to exercise its powers under the land rights act to grant the claim area to the traditional owners by scheduling that area</PARA>
<PARA>under the Land Rights Act. The result of such scheduling would be that no further hearing or report by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner would then be necessary in order for the Aboriginal people concerned to be able to have the full rights of enjoyment of their traditional lands in fee simple. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has the assurance of all parties to the negotiations that representative views of all Aboriginal people concerned have been obtained and their wishes taken into account. There are no financial implications arising from this bill. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for lunch, I was saying a few words about the fact that not only is access to tertiary education in Australia restricted because of Labor's policies, but also all students are now fee paying through HECS. Students have the worst of both worlds. We had to accept some restriction in access for the sake of free education. Now we have restricted access as well as fees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of her speech the honourable member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) referred to the disadvantage experienced by students in the rapidly expanding area of the western suburbs of Sydney, which is serviced by the University of Western Sydney. The honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) talked about people in outlying areas of Melbourne being disadvantaged. But all had to concede that the Gold Coast region of Australia is in fact the fastest growing area in Australia. It is an area that has suffered because of this government's funding policies for higher education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said before in this place, and I will say it again, that some people have an image of the Gold Coast as being a wealthy, glamorous, glitzy place. Those people do not ever look at the facts. When we look at the statistics, such as average household income and so on, we find that the Gold Coast region is one of the lowest income areas of Australia. It would be as mistaken to take the homes on the harbour side of Sydney as the norm for that city and saying that people who live in Sydney are very wealthy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality of life for people who live on the Gold Coast is rather different from that portrayed by its image. I would like to point out to those who have talked about the difficulties of people living in the outer suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne that it is not only the large cities where there is disadvantage. Apart from an infrequent, privately owned bus service, there is no public transport from the Gold Coast to the Brisbane universities. Students who live on the Gold Coast and who want to do courses which are not offered at the Gold Coast University College are extremely disadvantaged by geography. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If honourable members care to look at the geography of the Gold Coast itself, they would see that students can live 25 miles away from the Gold Coast University College campus with access only via a very poor public transport service. They would realise that, for young people attempting to access tertiary education on the Gold Coast, life is very difficult indeed. Further, there are only limited courses available at the Gold Coast University College and extremely limited places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some criticism has been made&mdash;and properly so&mdash;of the fact that, under this bill, Victoria gets no allocation at all. The allegation has been made&mdash;and it seems to have substance&mdash;that there were political considerations in determining how many places each state got. I point out that Queensland, which has 10 times the population of the ACT and the most dispersed population of any state in Australia, receives only six times the allocation of the ACT, whose population lives in a single city. Physical access to the ACT's institutions is reasonably easy. Whilst Queensland appears to have done relatively well, a redress of historic imbalance and shortfall was required. Of course there is also the matter of it being the most rapidly growing state with a greater and greater proportion of Australia's total population. Further, having a dispersed population causes difficulties in areas of tertiary education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has fallen back on the device of saying, `Well, fewer people should be going to universities anyway'. They have the fall back position of TAFE. The result of this diversion of students means a diversion of TAFE resources away from students who want to do TAFE courses to those who do not want to do them, but who are enrolled in a TAFE course only to further their university aspirations. This is an enormous waste of scarce resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, because time is very limited, I want to make a couple of comments about the Open Learning Agency. One of the things this bill does is scale back on the funding of the Open Learning Agency, because the actual enrolments have fallen rather short of the estimates. This is a great disappointment to the opposition, as I am sure it is to the government. We have been critical throughout of the way in which the government went about setting up the Open Learning Agency, although as long ago as the 1984 federal election we were advocating the establishment of such a form of education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One area of concern is access by mature age students to tertiary education. The Open Learning Agency was meant to be a device to enhance access by mature age students to tertiary education. There is a very real concern that the government has abandoned these students because of the political imperatives of school leavers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Employment, Education and Training, twice in the same paragraph of his second reading speech&mdash;a paragraph to which I have already referred&mdash;sought to give emphasis to the particular needs of school leavers by saying `especially school leavers' and `including recent school leavers'. The opposition agrees. We believe that qualified students, whether they are recent school leavers or mature age students, should have access to tertiary education&mdash;and we say that the government's policies are preventing this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the facts. A recent report of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training and its Higher Education Council has revealed that access of mature age students has suffered as demand for places by school leavers has risen. Several states have reported that in 1992 demand for places by mature age students was higher than by year 12 students. Reinforcing that, New South Wales, South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland all had approximately one-third more mature age applications than year 12 applications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge) has already pointed out that as the recession continues to force retrenchments of middle aged Australians, including those who already hold post-secondary qualifications, thousands more will seek access to this form of education. However, over the last seven years, the number of undergraduate mature age entrants nationally has dropped from 55.7 per cent to 47.9 per cent. We lament the fact that the Open Learning Agency is not meeting more of the unsatisfied demand, part of which it was established to meet. We also lament the fact that mature age students who have a particular need appear to be being precluded. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1993 amends the Higher Education Funding Act by increasing the higher education contribution scheme contributions payable by students who take longer than is usually required to complete their courses; by increasing the HECS contributions which are payable by students taking further undergraduate or postgraduate studies; and increasing the rates payable by graduates who choose to defer their HECS liability. The current HECS system is flexible and caters for the needs of all students, irrespective of their financial circumstances. Students are able to pay their HECS liability per semester up-front or they can choose to defer that liability until they are earning a decent wage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, university enrolments last year were in excess of some 580,000, an increase of some four per cent on the previous year, and they are expected to surpass that mark this year. In fact, university enrolments increased by some 64 per cent in the 10-year period from 1982 to 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor's commitment to higher education is unprecedented&mdash;and I would compliment the two ministers at the table, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) and the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free). I would particularly compliment the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training on the good work he has done in the period he has been minister. I know that Minister Crean will also bring a great deal of experience into the portfolio, which we have yet to see. But certainly I have enjoyed working with Minister Free up to this time, and I am sure that will continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The demand for tertiary places continues to grow as a natural result of growth in population and the increasing number of students who are returning and completing their secondary education. That, again, is as a result of policies which Minister Free has been a part of implementing. The changes that this government has brought in certainly have seen more students get into university&mdash;student numbers have grown&mdash;and students themselves have been able to obtain the best possible chance to join the work force in a field of their choice. It is certainly our responsibility to ensure that everyone who would like to study at university is given a chance to qualify for a place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt remarks have been made that some students do miss out on places at university. But I think we need to look at the increased numbers of students who have been able to qualify and get into university in the last 10 years as the numbers at universities have expanded. It is a little bit darwinian when we think of the numbers of students who do sit for the HSC, the number who do aspire towards a higher education. The fact is that only a certain percentage has ever been able to obtain a university position. The policies and changes that have been put in place over the last 10 years certainly make that fairer where a student's socioeconomic background does not preclude him or her from being able to get into university. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Access to tertiary education in Australia is something that we too readily take for granted. To maximise our tertiary sector, a change in attitude towards our universities must occur. Tertiary education is certainly a privilege, but it is not a right, and should be viewed as such. Certainly gone are the days when high school graduates opted for university to enjoy a healthy social life without having to overly exert themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we approach the 21st century, it is vital that our universities are able to offer the widest variety of courses to as many students as possible to cater for the ever changing employment market. This change has occurred in the last 10 or so years as universities have attempted to grapple with changing conditions and as governments have attempted to grapple with changing conditions in the economy, the labour market, student aspirations and what society desires. This bill ensures that this will be possible. It will ensure that everybody who wants a tertiary education has access to one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes to the higher education contribution scheme contained in the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill I believe are both fair and equitable. This bill increases HECS funding by some 50 per cent for students taking longer than is usually required to complete a course. Students are currently liable to pay a set contribution for each year of study. The contribution is determined by multiplying the annual course contribution by the student's load, and the student's load depends on whether he or she is studying full time or part time. In 1993 the annual course contribution was $2,328 for a full-time student. The HECS contribution is approximately 20 per cent of the total cost of a student's education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increasing the HECS contribution for students taking longer to complete their courses than required will, in the majority of cases, make sure that students work to their fullest potential rather than giving them the opportunity to coast along while possibly denying keener students a position at university. I am not for one moment criticising students but rather pointing out that in the past our higher education has been taken advantage of. I have no doubt that an increased HECS liability will be a motivating factor with students toying with their tertiary studies. Having studied at tertiary level, I can tell honourable members that students serious about getting a quality education know why they are at university and work hard to perform at the highest level they can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are provisions for students with genuine circumstances, such as illness, et cetera, to be granted an exemption from an increased liability. The HECS liability for students to take on further undergraduate or postgraduate courses will also be increased. From 1 January, that HECS contribution will be doubled for those students. This will ensure that school leavers have access to university places which may have been taken by students undertaking second degrees. Simply, the bill will make sure that students carefully review and make their university choices very carefully rather than adopting a hit-and-miss approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also accelerates the rate of repayment on a HECS debt from some two, three and four per cent to three, four and five per cent for students who have chosen to defer their HECS liability. Students will begin to repay their HECS liability once that taxable income threshold reaches some $27,748. The deferment of the HECS liability means that students will not be burdened with repayments while they are studying or looking for work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our Labor government can stand tall and proud on its commitment to educating Australians, particularly in the higher education sector. It has met the changes which have occurred in the last 10 years particularly, and it is leading the way in pushing the numbers up in higher education. Certainly&mdash;as an aside which I understand is not directly related to this bill&mdash;it is leading the way in its commitment to the TAFE sector. In Australia 3.3 per cent of our total population is studying at higher education institutions, as opposed to only 1.2 per cent in the United Kingdom. Some 42 per cent of our total education budget, or four per cent of our total budget expenditure, is for higher education</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth pointing out that in the five-year period to 1995 some 95,000 additional places will be created at a cost of $1.4 billion, which augurs well for the future of newly created institutions such as the Southern Cross University at Lismore. The Southern Cross University at Lismore will mean that students on the north coast of New South Wales will not have to move too far to receive quality tertiary education. In case honourable members do not know, the Southern Cross University was formerly a campus of the University of New England at Armidale and on 1 January 1994 it became a fully fledged university in its own right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also point out that the response to the university has been overwhelming to say the least and the Southern Cross University will offer 1,335 undergraduate places this year. It received some 20,000 applications for those places. Of those 20,000 applications, 4,500 students nominated the Lismore institution as their first choice. Having a university on the north coast will benefit the region in many ways as it has already done in the past, and it will continue to do so. Foremost, it will enable students to study the course of their choice and locally if they want to. Regions such as the north coast have traditionally suffered from what could be described as a brain drain. In previous years students have had to leave the region in order to undertake their university studies. Unfortunately, many of those students did not return, which meant lost opportunities in terms of job creation and lost knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the university will strengthen the north coast by providing not only quality education to its students&mdash;one student about to graduate is the son of Minister Free; and I congratulate him&mdash;but also by providing jobs and creating economic spin-offs for the region. There has been a tremendous spin-off to the city of Lismore, the surrounding villages and the north coast in general which has been created by the presence of the university. As certain areas of the economy there, particularly the rural industries, contracted some many years ago, that shortfall in local input of money was picked up opportunely by the presence of the university as it expanded considerably in those last five to six years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, there were some 20,000 applications for those few places at the university. Perhaps the minister might consider expanding the 1,335 undergraduate places a little next year; 20,000 students cannot be wrong. The strong demand for places at the Southern Cross University is a clear indication that higher education on the north coast has a very bright future. We can all be very justifiably proud of our university there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to comment on some of the outreach centres that the university has established, particularly the Tweed open learning centre. It certainly received my blessing and support three years ago when it was opened. It has been a bonus for the city of Murwillumbah. It has certainly received the patronage of many students there. It has meant that people who would normally be faced with a journey of one hour or more by vehicle&mdash;a private passenger vehicle, too&mdash;to the city of Lismore have been able to access the facilities through that open learning centre. It has been a great boon to many people who would not normally be able to undertake a university education. I commend those types of institutions and changes to the university. They have meant a great deal to people in the electorates of Richmond and Page and even to one or two students across the border in the electorate of McPherson, I understand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, there has been criticism by the other side of the changes proposed by the government in this piece of legislation. We have introduced equity into the university system. It has meant that many of our students who would not normally be able to get into university have been able to do so. Certainly, I think the ministers at the table can be proud of this. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank all honourable members who have participated in the debate on the Higher Education Funding Bill. I did not introduce the legislation, but it is an important part of the learning curve to swat up on it and listen to what other honourable members have had to say. In response, I want to comment on a few issues that were raised by the opposition. I say at the outset that, if anyone does doubt the Commonwealth's commitment to funding for higher education, he or she need look no further than the figures themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill provides funding which will rise to $5 billion in 1996. For the triennium that we are dealing with&mdash;1994-96&mdash;$14.8 billion has been committed by the Commonwealth, which has resulted in a massive increase in places since 1988 under this government. Places have increased by 25 per cent in universities. In excess of 100,000 new places will have been created in the decade 1988 to 1998. There are now over 580,000 students in our universities out of a population of 17.6 million. The proportion of the population in higher education in Australia is 3.35 per cent compared with only 1.28 per cent in the UK. I make that point from the outset. I will now address a number of the issues that have been raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first issue that I will touch on is in relation to school leavers. It is argued that we have changed the policy for unfilled places and that this is having an impact on mature age students. Despite the huge increase that the government has made in those 100,000 places, the institutions have chosen to allocate growth in those places to graduates undertaking further undergraduate qualifications as well as increasing the provisions for postgraduates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that more than 90 per cent of places created between 1988 and 1993 have been taken up by students already in the system. It does not leave much for the school leavers. In fact, opportunities for school leavers fell by 8.1 per cent in the period 1990 to 1993. Given the fact that the universities, the educators, the opposition&mdash;everyone&mdash;said that part of the reason why we had to increase our commitment to places in universities was due to the demand coming from school leavers, it seems only fair that we redress that imbalance. That is essentially what the government has done with its recent discussions with the universities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have negotiated school leaver and undergraduate targets with institutions as part of the profile discussions undertaken last year. The key thrust of those discussions was to provide opportunities for all those who are new to higher education. Even with the new understandings about school leavers, the impact will still result in 50 per cent mature age students having access to places and being in places in universities. So the share will be evened out. The exercise is one of evening up and it is consistent with the arguments put to us associated with the need to increase places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that was raised by the opposition went to the question of the criteria for allocating public resources. There was reference to the speech of the then Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley), in November last year. In that speech he indicated that the criteria for allocating public resources needed to be looked at in the future. As to future places&mdash;this bill deals with future places&mdash;the minister indicated at the time that it would be based on an assessment of low population and high participation areas being reversed&mdash;high population and low participation. I cannot see anything wrong with that approach. If what we are talking about is need, based on where the activity is happening, it makes sense for us, as part of our commitment, to take note of those shifts and to try to adjust places accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way the formula has been applied has nothing to do with the political circumstances in Victoria. It has been done by objective criteria based on information which has been exchanged at the profile discussions. I point out that, of the 1,500 places, only 1,000 have been allocated in that manner. The other 500 places are still up for grabs, so to speak, based on the extent to which the universities can attract industry interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that Victoria has been extremely successful in the past in garnering such places. If we look at the last three years, of the total 2,200 joint Commonwealth/industry places in universities, Victoria was successful in gaining 1,188 of those places. That is over 50 per cent. When the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) argues that there is no opportunity to accommodate additional places, not only is he misrepresenting the position but he is selling his state and the universities in that state short. In respect of the criterion which could involve the shift of currently allocated places, to which the former Minister for Employment, Education and Training, referred in his speech, I point out that the commitment was made that there would be full consultation with those affected and I recommit to that position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for La Trobe said that the Berwick campus would get no additional places and would therefore be disadvantaged by this measure. I have today had the opportunity to speak to the Vice-Chancellor of that university and I suggest that the honourable member for La Trobe ought to get his facts right in this regard. Whilst it is true that Monash&mdash;or, for that matter, any university&mdash;does not get any additional places out of the 1,000, it is able to bid for the remaining 500. In addition, the government has recommitted itself to the capital works program for the Berwick campus. Discussions between the university and the Commonwealth have also resulted in a situation in which that university is embarking on an innovative new approach. Without the additional option of places, it intends to use some of the capital expenditure, along with information technology and networking, to provide services from the university to a much wider regional base. I would suggest that, rather than spreading misinformation in this place, the honourable member for La Trobe ought to sit down properly with that university, which he claims to represent, and find out precisely what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of his argument that the demand is not there, the honourable member should note what Professor Chipman from Monash University said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">La Trobe Valley Express</EMPHASIS> on 20 January. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He said this week, predicted that the demand and supply for university places in regional Victoria had never been better and students would have their best chance of ever of getting their entry level scores&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem of excess demand for university places had now been overcome due to increased places being allocated to school leavers and a nationwide reduction in the number of students in year 12 secondary courses.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that demonstrates that the Commonwealth is trying to come to grips with what the actual position is, where the real demand is, where the pressures are and where the needs are. I think that should properly be taken on board by the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final comment goes to the question of open learning. I am interested in the comments of the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) in relation to this matter. I am very interested in the open learning concept. This bill provides significant funding to enable that development to continue. I intend to visit the facility in Melbourne the week after next. I am told that the program is going extremely well. There are 9,000 students enrolled, half of whom are school leavers. The open learning program is well on target to have 20,000 enrollees by the end of the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important innovation that this government and the former Minister for Employment, Education and Training were instrumental in pushing through. It provides the additional flexibility that is needed and again it cements this government's commitment to education, in particular to higher education and more innovative and effective ways of delivering it. The government does not support the amendment that has been moved by the opposition. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

He is actually interstate. It is the lot of people in his position. I am sure that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) will understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate the contribution of the minister and welcome the fact that perhaps we are actually going to start debating some education issues in this chamber. There are a couple of things I want to refer to on behalf of the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make it clear that the opposition supports moves that will open up opportunities for students and lessen the rigidity of the present situation. We recognise that that is what the government is attempting to do at least in the terms that the minister stated in his speech in reply to the second reading debate. I will not reiterate all of our arguments about how we think that should be done differently. However, we do recognise that there are problems at present with students staying on to get further qualifications and thereby occupying places, making them unavailable to other students to enter tertiary education at all. It was for that reason that we had moved an amendment to the motion for the second reading of the bill that this matter needed to be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levying of HECS on students according to their present qualifications and, in particular, what their student load will be is one of the very important issues in this bill. We have all heard arguments from a wide range of people, including the National Union of Students, academics and others, about whether or not this move is fair. The opposition sought, through its amendment, to get a committee to call in this evidence and find out the facts about how people will be affected. Perhaps it is possible that the government might look at a relevant modification of this policy. Having said that, we do not defend a situation where people stay in the system, year in, year out, doing courses and getting qualifications, becoming the professional students we hear about and, under the present limited situation, thereby denying other students access to any tertiary education at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister quite rightly pointed out that institutions have pursued certain courses which have exacerbated the situation. Many times during my years in this place I have pointed out that we have to be vigilant on behalf of students. One cannot leave it to those who make decisions in universities as they do not necessarily put the interests of students first on all occasions. I have witnessed that often enough. There is a role for politicians to make sure that students' interests are protected. I would hope that that is what we&mdash;the government and the opposition&mdash;are about in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the minister's statements in relation to school leavers. I reiterate and emphasise that we do not want to see school leavers put at a disadvantage by mature aged students, but we also do not want to see mature aged students put at a disadvantage by school leavers. The rigidities make it an either/or situation and are at the core of our criticisms of the direction of the government's education policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister said&mdash;I tried to write his words down but may not have them absolutely accurately&mdash;that the opportunities for school leavers fell in the 1990-93 period by approximately eight per cent and that this figure had to be improved. He said that this is obviously a matter of great concern. Our criticism is that the Government's approach amounts to rearranging deckchairs. We are still very concerned about mature aged students&mdash;those who did not have access to tertiary education in their time&mdash;those who, for reasons of geography, marital status, lot in life, fate or whatever, could not have study at the tertiary level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also concerned about people who have qualifications but who, because of changes in our society, in our economy, now find themselves unemployed. People with heavy family responsibilities and commitments in life are finding that their qualifications no longer carry them into employment, whether it is because they are out of date or because industry has changed. These people who find themselves in competition with younger people with newer, more relevant qualifications are seeking to go back to tertiary institutions to get further qualifications. We read about this all the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure the minister is as aware as anybody is of the great heartache out there in the community, particularly amongst those aged 40-plus who are finding themselves on the scrap heap. This will be an increasing problem in our society. For 10 to 15 years, that issue has been raised in debates on education in this parliament. The issue involved is access by older people to further education and training so that they can keep up with technology, remain employable and remain contributing members of society. These people, for a variety of reasons, are very important. The minister said that the government's aim is that mature aged students constitute 50 per cent of tertiary entrants. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the minister for that clarification. That is still a very significant reduction. The figures I quoted from an NBEET report showed that in the seven years to 1993 mature aged tertiary entrants had dropped from 55.7 per cent of first year undergraduates to 47.9 per cent. Even 50 per cent is a big reduction from the 55.7 per cent that we had back in the mid-1980s. I believe that the pressure on the system would have become very much heavier since then. The opposition had hoped that the Open Learning Agency would have attracted more enrolments than it has. It is included in this bill because there is a downgrading of funding following an enrolment shortfall. We are very concerned about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say a few words about what the minister had to say about allocating places and bidding for places. Anyone who reads this debate might well be confused about the figures we are talking about. I will place on the record the figures that I have been referring to in this debate because they are not contained in any official document before the parliament and would not be easy to access. The information I have from the department was that the 1996 allocation would be New South Wales, 350; Victoria, nil; Queensland, 370; Western Australia, 200; South Australia, 295; Tasmania, 135; ACT, 60; Northern Territory, 15; Australian Catholic University, which has campuses in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and the ACT, 150. That adds up to 1,575. I have only just done the additions because I wanted to see whether the figure was 1,000 or 1,500. Obviously something is a little bit loose there. Those are figures which were supplied to the opposition and to which I have been referring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that only 1,000 were allocated and that 500 are still up for grabs raises an even bigger question mark over those figures. We will be looking with great interest to see what the outcome is. I will be very interested to see whether Queensland stays at 370 and whether the Gold Coast, which is an area of significant disadvantage in terms of tertiary places, maintains its position. </PARA>

It will be paid until the end of the calendar year in which a dependent child, generally the youngest child, turns 18 or until the child ceases secondary schooling, whichever happens first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefit will not be paid when a child is a prescribed student, except if the child is qualified to receive payments under the assistance for isolated children scheme. A prescribed student child is a young person who has turned 16 and is qualified to receive payments under a prescribed educational scheme such as Austudy or Abstudy. To qualify for the allowance, the person needs to be an inhabitant of Australia and physically present in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is to be another allowance: the partner allowance. The complexity of these matters never ceases to amaze me. The abolition of the dependent spouse rebate for couples with dependent children means that some current recipients of the job search allowance, newstart allowance, sickness allowance and special benefit will be required to pay tax on their allowances unless further amendments are made to the social security system. I am not complaining about that&mdash;it is to make the scheme coherent&mdash;but paying an additional allowance to make a coherent scheme begs the question. To overcome this consequence, a second new allowance, the partner allowance, will be introduced in September 1994, and changes are to be made to the beneficiary tax rebates available now under the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have separate legislation&mdash;it will keep us legislators in business&mdash;in relation to the Income Tax Assessment Act to remove the beneficiary tax rebate scheme that is now available. The partner allowance will be paid instead. It is to be an additional amount of allowance paid to the current recipients of the benefits that I mentioned. The partner allowance will be available to dependent partners of those receiving special benefits as well. The partner allowance will be paid directly to the dependent partner. The combined amount of allowances received by these couples is said not to be affected by these changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that when we go to the estimated outlays for both of these measures&mdash;and some of the information is given in the explanatory memorandum&mdash;we find that the first year in which we can see the full year effects of these changes is 1996-97. The reason is fairly simple. It would appear that the government will have a net outcome of quite a substantial budget effect in 1994-95 and 1995-96. It is because of the extent to which the new outlays are paid up front and because people will have to claim later their dependent spouse rebates that the savings are not generated immediately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1996-97 the government will receive in the order of $900 million&mdash;$920.3 million to be precise&mdash;in extra tax through the abolition of the dependent spouse rebate. The net additional cost, or the outlay effect, of the new scheme in that year in the social security budget is $1,146.5 billion. We can see that the net budget effect of these proposals is not a new benefit of over $1 billion to families; the net outcome is $226.2 million in the year 1996-97. That is the effect of these changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it clear at the outset that we will not be opposing this bill, but we are intending to draw to people's attention some of the consequences of this legislation that are not readily understood, or explained by the parliamentary secretary, or explained in the explanatory memorandum. The government would have us believe that these proposals are more generous, but the income of most families will not change, other than as a result of other changes the government made in the last budget. There are certain families&mdash;and this is an advantage of some sort&mdash;who only receive beneficiary income at the moment where there are no tax amounts payable in that family situation and where there would be no dependent spouse rebate available. Those families will receive an additional benefit. I acknowledge that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other changes, we are told, is that the benefit will be paid directly to the parent caring for the child rather than to the parent who receives the tax concession. I imagine that that is another significant advantage. The point is often made that the maternal spouse, or the one that is caring, carries a greater load of certain types of expenditures. That would be the argument. Of course, the benefit is immediately payable through the social security system. It will go onto the same rates at which the family payments are paid. As a consequence, rather than waiting until the end of the year or receiving it through the reduced pay instalment reduction, on which basis the dependent spouse rebate is presently paid, if people fall within the income test limits, the amount will be available immediately rather than at the end of the year. They are the advantages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put that because I think it is fair to outline those changes, but I think there are other ways in which these effects could have been achieved. Certainly, it would have been characterised in a different way if the government had seen fit to look at changes that might more accurately reflect efficient administrative arrangements.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has to wonder why we have the child support scheme in the Australian Taxation Office. Why is an office which deals with tax making payments to people who are receiving maintenance? Why is it involved in collecting and paying those instalments? One has to wonder why the tax office has been set up with that responsibility if logically the social security department should have been doing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of these changes the government introduces a child-care rebate scheme. What do we do in relation to that? We do not make the payments through the social security system, we make them through the Medibank offices. What sorts of coherent, sensible administrative arrangements are we putting in place if we have to amend a multiplicity of acts and have to establish a separate bureaucracy for each form of payment that is being made? Where is the sense?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government would argue that it is providing these additional benefits because it wants to help families. These are certainly not the same families who this year, in the Year of the Family, have suffered as a result of the income ceiling being reduced from $64,938 to $60,000 for the basic family payment for families with one child or who have suffered as a result of the additional amount allowed for each child being reduced from $3,249 to $3,000. Certainly they are not the same families who saw the existing assets value limit for the basic family payment reduced from $607,250 to $550,000; who saw the application of the family payment and income test to new student parents&mdash;after the reduction we made, it now applies only to those going into the system, as distinct from those who are already there; who saw the employer provided fringe benefits now taken into account for income testing for family payments; and who saw some people in necessitous circumstances losing benefits, particular those in remote areas, in defence forces and the like. The government was not prepared to accommodate them when it made these changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures stop 116,000 families in the system from receiving family payments. And of course there is a cut in the payment which many other families will receive and on which they are dependent. It excludes the 116,000 families but there are a lot of others who have reduced benefits in the family payment system&mdash;not the same system we are debating here today. We are talking about the income available to support families; this wonderful new initiative of the government. I have to say that if it was a big initiative for the Year of the Family then it misses its mark widely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make some other comments in relation to it. It is interesting that, while we are stopping 116,000 families from receiving family payments, there are some people who will gain eligibility for assistance&mdash;the government did not explain this. We are not opposing this either, but it ought to be understood that holders of PRC entry permits or refugee entry permits come into it for the first time. So at the same time as some families are losing benefits, new families are receiving benefits that we were not told about. I guess that is one of the reasons why the system costs an extra $200 million to administer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to take honourable members through some of the other matters because the opposition, while not opposing this measure, will be seeking to refer the bill to a committee of the Senate for an inquiry. The reason is clear. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The originality comes in the matters that we think ought to be investigated. It will need to look at the definitions of income that apply, and I will come to that in a moment because there are some people who at the moment would receive the dependent spouse rebate and who, as it appears to me on reading this legislation, will not receive the child home care allowance. It will look at the application of the income tests, the administrative arrangements for couples when they separate and the adequacy of those arrangements and what happens when people are temporarily absent from Australia. On the date of application they have to be here, but what happens when they are away for short periods of time? It will look at the tax file number provisions. I imagine with a large number of additional Australians coming into a situation where there is data matching that will be a significant matter. These are issues, including the residency requirements, that we expect the Senate committee will review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to address some of these factors because they have consequences and probably will not be readily understood. Hopefully, if there is an inquiry by the Senate, they will be better understood. I mentioned earlier in my introduction that the age requirements for this legislation are especially constructed to deal with situations where young people who are 18 years of age or who have ceased secondary schooling receive other prescribed educational payments. Because of the way the government has structured this at the moment, people with students up to the age of 25 now receive the dependent spouse rebate at a higher level. We now have a group of people with student children aged between 18 and 25 years receiving a lower rate of payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment the dependent spouse rebate is paid for those with no dependent children and will continue to be paid to those with no dependent children. It will be paid at the rate of $1,188 per annum. But for those with dependent children it is paid at the rate of $1,425 per annum. The cut-off age for students under this new scheme is 18 years of age, whereas under the dependent spouse rebate scheme children in full-time education until they reach 25 years were counted. Taxpayers with student children satisfying the separate net income test of the Income Tax Assessment Act will lose out on the abolition of the dependent spouse rebate for couples with dependent children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that the scheme cuts off the allowance to a student receiving the payment under a prescribed educational scheme; that is stated. Certainly, when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was making his announcements at Bankstown he was not saying to those dependants in the education system that there will be a lower rate of payment under this new arrangement and that they will be eliminated from receiving the benefits that are now paid. He was not prepared to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum states in relation to this matter that the total cost of the outlays for the measures is $4.25 million which, I imagine, is administrative this year; $500 million in 1994-95; and $300 million in 1995-96. It would be interesting to know what the cost would have been if the dependent spouse rebate had been retained for students between the ages of 18 and 25. I suspect it is another one of these pea and thimble tricks that the government has been involved in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For me it is a bit of an education to try to go back and rehash the residency requirements in the Income Tax Assessment Act and the Social Security Act and to make some sense of them. We are told that our Social Security Act is written in plain English. It is very interesting the way in which these provisions have been developed. As I take honourable members through it, they may start to wonder whether or not it will be an act in plain English after these new provisions. </PARA>

<PARA>Do those opposite want me to go on? It is fascinating; it is riveting reading. We need to understand that this is all qualified by the fact that people have to be present in Australia, which is a limiting factor. These factors are relevant to residents in Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These tests, which are meant to assist, are quite different from the ones found in the Income Tax Assessment Act.

<PARA>What interests me is that we require people to be present in Australia to get this allowance, yet a residential requirement is there which enables officers, Australian officials and our defence forces, in the peace groups that are serving abroad and looking after Australia's interests, to continue to get the dependent spouse rebate. This legislation, drafted in plain English, is quite clear. The child had to be here in Australia on a given date to be able to receive it. So we write out those who are serving abroad in Australia's interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regard that as another serious consequence of the way in which this legislation has been drafted. It may have been unintended, but with this government we would not know whether it was not another sneaky way, in the spirit of the pea and thimble trick, of ripping back from Australian taxpayers benefits they now receive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) is being helped by the advice he is now receiving. There has been no parliamentary secretary or minister with responsibility in this area present in the course of this debate to hear any comments. One wonders how they are able to contribute sensibly to a discussion of this sort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come to the question of the way in which definitions of income and income-free areas apply. The definition of ordinary income in the Social Security Act is designed to achieve payments on a needs basis. This allowance is not an income support measure and the ordinary income benchmark to establish the home child-care rate has been raised by the inclusion of further amounts for the purposes of section 926. The government wants to narrow the definition of income taken into account, whereas if it is trying to stop people getting benefits it needs to widen the definition of income to restrict people's eligibility. In the words of the explanatory memorandum:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These modifications are being made to better accommodate the nature of home child care allowance compared to other payments under the Principal Act.</PARA>
<PARA>When we look at the concept of the separate net income on which the dependent spouse rebate is based, we see that, while departing from the concept of taxable income, it is closely aligned with ordinary notions of income. On the other hand, the concept of ordinary income for the purposes of the Social Security Act has been modified to such an extent that it is a misnomer to refer to the outcome as ordinary income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the dependent spouse rebate, provided for in the Income Tax Assessment Act, a statute that taxes income and capital gains, there are constraints on including amounts that are clearly not income or capital gains which are not present in extending the meaning of ordinary income within the Social Security Act, a statute basically providing income support and, in the case of the home child-care rebate, supplementary payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the substitution of the dependent spouse rebate for couples with dependent children under the Income Tax Assessment Act with the home child-care allowance payments under the Social Security Act must disadvantage recipients of the dependent spouse rebate in view of the very wide definition of income. So, having regard to the fact that the need of couples with children for the concessionary payment is greater, it would appear to be, in my view, inequitable for the government to propose to let the dependent spouse rebate for couples without children remain unchanged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very interesting that the government has left the dependent spouse rebate payable with all of the income tests that are presently used, which are considerably different to those which are now being used in the social security scheme, as people whose income situations are going to be roughly comparable and who are now receiving an allowance under the home child-care allowance arrangements will be considerably worse off in many cases, just because of the way in which the question of income is dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is particularly interesting that the government gets into such complexity in trying to model a new scheme to fit closely the scheme that is being abolished. It then fails to be able to translate it into the new scheme adequately. That is clearly what is happening with this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think this bill can be dealt with in the parliament in a couple of sitting days. I certainly doubt whether very many members of the government will turn their minds to these questions. They will be in here trying to praise the government for what it has done, for its pea and thimble trick. For that reason, I think it is very appropriate that the Senate&mdash;it seems to be the only house to be able to do this, as the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) lamented last night&mdash;give adequate scrutiny to the bill. If we had a system whereby committees of this House were given responsibility to look at legislation, then we in this House could perhaps look at some of the details and seek to have them clarified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system being the way it is, the opposition will not oppose the measure but we will seek that reference to a committee in the Senate. We will ensure that this legislation is thoroughly examined and we will ensure that all of these tricks that the government has been engaged in are fully and thoroughly exposed. When it rips back the benefits people presently receive in order to expand benefits for a group of others, we will make sure that people who are the losers know why and how that occurred. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

You would have observed that he could not tell you anything about what opposition members would do for families. There was no mention of their having all these great policies for families. The main reason for that is that they do not have a single policy. Their silly Fightback policy was so roundly rejected by the people of Australia just nine or 10 months ago that they are now bereft of policies. Not only are those opposite bereft of ideas and anybody who can lead them out of the wilderness but they have absolutely no policies. That was transparent in the presentation by the honourable member for Berowra. He could tell us nothing about what his party would do for families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the presentation of the honourable member for Berowra to honourable members of this House today, he failed to say that his party wanted to rip $10 billion off families and other welfare recipients in this country. That was part of the opposition's policies. It is an example of the great compassion of those opposite for families. Not only did they want to impose an additional tax on everything that families eat, wear and drink but also they wanted to rip $10 billion out of the welfare system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Berowra had the hide to come here and pontificate in front of us. He did all these grand dramatics and said how dreadful it is that the government is planning to introduce a policy that, in the 1994-95 financial year, gives an extra $517 million to families. I will let the people of Australia make the decision&mdash;as they did in March and as I am sure they will do every three years for the next decade&mdash;about which party in this parliament has some care and compassion, new ideas and something of value to contribute to families. Which party is trying to identify areas of need and put in positive programs to assist families? It certainly is not the party that the honourable member for Berowra represents. That is clear by his presentation today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was an astounding presentation when one takes account of the fact that the policy we are implementing was an election policy. It was one that the people of Australia very positively responded to. It was one that the families of Australia recognised as being of benefit to them. This policy is another part of the package of election promises that this government is now implementing. I am proud to be here this afternoon speaking on behalf of the government in support of this legislation. This is a very positive, new initiative. This is something of which the Australian Labor Party can be proud. This policy will benefit families around this country. </PARA>

Some important facts that people need to appreciate is that this new home child-care allowance will benefit 840,000 families throughout Australia. That is a major achievement in this International Year of the Family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, what is more important is that approximately 55,000 families whose tax liability was previously too low to get the full value of the existing dependent spouse rebate will now receive much greater assistance from this new allowance because of the introduction of the home child-care allowance. The honourable member for Berowra was not prepared to admit that very important point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Berowra clutched at straws when outlining some problems. We specified in the legislation the specific tests that would be required. We talked about residency. We dared to say that people have to be resident in Australia to receive the allowance. He railed against the government for that. But if we had not included those measures and clearly set them out in the legislation he would have said, `This is an incompetent government.

Previously, through the dependent spouse rebate system used in the tax system, the worker who was bringing home the pay packet got the benefit of the dependent spouse rebate through his or her tax rebate. There was no guarantee that the spouse who was at home looking after the children got any of that money. The family got it, but it was not necessarily ensured that the dependent spouse got it. </PARA>

The fact that those who have that responsibility will get the money is a very important philosophical improvement and something about which we should all be very pleased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what is also important about the changes in the partner allowance. The additional income that was attached to the jobsearch allowance and the other unemployment and social security benefits which were added to the recipient's payments for his or her dependent spouse will now be separated and sent to the spouse so that he or she has the opportunity to receive that income for his or her needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The income level that has been set is an increase over and above what was previously allowable. It is a significant additional contribution by the government to the welfare of families in this country. It is something about which we should be very pleased. I believe that the system as it is outlined in the legislation makes the current system much fairer. As the honourable member for Berowra has indicated, some people who currently receive the dependent spouse rebate will no longer receive it because of the imposition of the income test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This means that the system of financial support to families in this country corresponds with the system that applies generally to social security; that is, it is targeted to those who have the greatest need. I do not think that is a principle that we should have any problems with and I do not believe it is a principle that the people of Australia disagree with. They believe that government payments should be targeted to those families or individuals&mdash;whether they be aged persons, young families or people with disabilities&mdash;who have few resources and assets to be able to fend for themselves. That is the purpose of introducing an income test on the allocation of the home child-care allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The procedures outlined in this legislation are very important and the government is rightly proud of them. It is the implementation of an election commitment and continues the record set since the election of the government of fulfilling all of its election commitments, as we did through the budget last year and will do now in this measure. It is an important new addition to the package of financial support that this government provides to families in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to raise in this debate another element of care for families. My view is that there is a need for some improvement in the access to occasional care facilities for the very people we are talking about; that is, dependent spouses at home who have responsibility for children. It is an area in which I would like to see some additional effort made by the government over the next couple of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment the government funds around 4,200 occasional child-care places nationally. Funding is available for another 780 places, but they are yet to be put in place by state governments. We have a commitment for 5,000 occasional care places&mdash;4,200 are currently in place and 780 are yet to be put in place. Some 18 per cent of long day care usage is for non-work related care; in other words, it is for people at home who wish to use the child care for purposes other than studying, looking for jobs or actually being in employment. That amounts to some additional 28,000 equivalent full-time places for occasional day care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated, some 840,000 families in this country have a dependent spouse with dependent children at home. Therefore, the number of places available for occasional day care for those people is quite low. The last time the government introduced any major new initiative to boost the number of places in occasional day care was in the 1988 child-care strategy, which flowed through until 1990-91 when most of the capital expenditure was spent on provision of places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1993-94 financial year the government will be spending some $10.9 million on the provision of occasional day care. It is a very important contribution for those spouses at home. It is part of a very large package of child care that the government has implemented in the last six to seven years. But because over the last few years we have placed such a priority on work related child care and on providing places in the child-care system for mainly women who wish to return to work and who have child-care responsibilities, we seem to have lacked paying enough attention to those people who are in the home and who have child-care needs as well, but who are not working or seeking further study. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I place on record my view that, in the next budget or within the next two years, the government should seek to increase the allocation for occasional care, but also try to sort out some of the problems that are currently existing, particularly with the New South Wales state government, in the implementation of the current agreements. I indicated that some 780 places for occasional care were funded out of the 1988 strategy that are yet to be put in place. Out of that 780, 670 are in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There seems to have been some blockage between the New South Wales government and the federal government in working out the financial arrangements to enable those places to be built and to be funded on a recurrent basis. That is denying the families of New South Wales and the dependent spouses of New South Wales an opportunity to have access to those occasional care places. It is very important that, whatever those problems are, the two governments sit down and work them out so that we can get that funding flowing into the community to provide those places. It is one of the concerns that is raised with me in my electorate, even though the Queensland government has been very good in negotiating with the federal government. Only a handful of places are yet to be fully funded in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate I have a number of dependent spouses, people at home caring for children, who have raised with me their concerns that all of the child-care places in our area are taken up by working people and that they have little or no access to occasional care so that they can carry out their responsibilities. We should not forget that in most cases it is the full-time mothers at home who are contributing greatly to our community in the form of assisting in schools, community organisations and a range of other areas in a voluntary capacity. In order for them to perform that very valuable community role that we absolutely rely on in our schools and community organisations, we need to have some additional child-care places for them so that they can place their toddler children in occasional care. This will then enable them to be able to work for organisations such as Meals on Wheels or to work in the school tuckshop or in school classrooms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the government has placed a very strong and appropriate emphasis on work related child care, I fear that the provision of occasional day care has tended to lapse in the last two years. I urge the government to consider an increase in funding over the next two years for the provision of occasional day care places so that we can correct that imbalance and provide that service to those families who are playing that very important role of raising children in their own home, who are playing important roles in community organisations and institutions such as schools and who are acting as volunteers in nursing homes or in a whole host of other places. They are providing to the community important services which are not work related, but they also need access to that occasional care. So I ask for a little redress in the current balance of provision of child-care places in the next budget or two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Social Security (Home Child Care and Partner Allowances) Legislation Amendment Bill, which we are talking about today, is a very important new initiative by the government. It is a much fairer and more equitable way to distribute family support to those people who are staying at home and caring for dependent children. It is a very strong initiative in this International Year of the Family which will amount to an additional $517 million in 1994-95 and an additional $341.5 million in 1995-96. It is by no stretch of the imagination a pea and thimble trick. It is a significant additional expenditure for the provision of families in this community. It is something that this government is very proud of and I am proud to support the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that I will have the ear of Deputy Speaker Hollis for the next 20 minutes or so, as he and I have had a few private discussions about some of these issues over the last few weeks. This debate, as the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) suggested, is timely because it is the International Year of the Family and child care is a very important subject for all families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the face of it, the changes that this legislation brings are quite supportable. The principle of recognising the importance of the contribution made by a stay-at-home or non-working parent to the care of children is a very important one. However, in practice, the dependent spouse rebate achieved the same purpose, but for some reason it is no longer politically correct to regard the stay-at-home parent as dependent, and I suppose it is not worth having a deep argument about that. Dependency is out. It might be natural, but it is not politically correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not really want to dwell too much on that issue. I accept the change in respect of that factor. I understand, particularly as I have taken advantage of the dependent spouse rebate in my own tax for many years, that the rebate really did get lost somehow in the working spouse's tax return. The $30 per week maximum which the home care parent will receive will be of more practical use. I do not think there is any doubt about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I take up the point that the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) made in speaking for the opposition on this matter and take issue with the honourable member for Moreton. I do not do that terribly often, but on this occasion I will. There was an element of dishonesty, or a misleading element, let me say, in the way this legislation was introduced. It was foreshadowed with a flourish by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) early in the election campaign. The impression that he gave then&mdash;and, indeed, the impression that I had for some time&mdash;was that this measure was something new and that it was over and above all existing mechanisms. It was only when we read the fine print that we found, despite what the honourable member for Moreton said, that this measure is essentially revenue neutral. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I concede that there were some families who did not get the full dependent spouse rebate&mdash;55,000 families, I think he said&mdash;and I am prepared to accept that figure. They will get the home child-care allowance. That is where the additional expenditure comes from. But by and large one cannot argue that this is other than revenue neutral. The substantial effect of this legislation is to replace the dependent spouse rebate with the home child-care allowance. As I have said, in principle I do not have a problem with that. In fact, the principle I subscribe to very strongly because it recognises the importance of the contribution made by a stay-at-home parent to the care of children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister for social security, the honourable member for Berowra, has outlined a number of important practical concerns we have about the legislation. They are detailed concerns. Hence the opposition's intention to refer this matter to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. There are a number of unanswered questions about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, child care is, quite correctly, an important element in the debate which is occurring in the International Year of the Family. The remarks I want to make tonight hopefully will be accepted in the broad context of that debate. The government, and particularly the minister, Senator Crowley, whom I call, perhaps a little unkindly but quite pointedly, not the Minister for Family Services but the minister for family disservices, has already turned the International Year of the Family into a platform for all sorts of minority groups who aspire to be regarded as families. But the real focus in the IYF needs to be on children, not on the rights of consenting adults or on all sorts of other peripheral issues that the so-called Minister for Family Services wants to talk about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) will disagree&mdash;although she has on occasions disagreed with me&mdash;that child care is essentially, fundamentally, basically, a parental responsibility. Any couple who have children must start from that point. They must realise that the care and upbringing of those children is their responsibility. I do not think there is an argument against that&mdash;not, at least, a cogent one that I have ever heard. However, the extent to which they undertake the function of child care personally or delegate it to somebody else is the matter which is being debated. I use the word `delegate' very carefully, for when parents do give the responsibility to someone else it is a delegated responsibility. For ultimately the responsibility for the care and upbringing of those children is the parents' responsibility. That is a very important underlying point that needs to be made early in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point may be a little more controversial. I challenge the honourable member for Forde, and the long list of government speakers who have been trotted out on this subject&mdash;and I will listen to them all with interest&mdash;to refute that most people accept that parent care is best. I say that again: parent care is best. I think most people recognise that, except for the social engineers such as the minister, who apparently wants to get children into government accredited child-care centres as soon as possible so that boys can be taught to play with dolls and girls with cars and all sorts of other things. Social engineering is really what it is. I have no doubt about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most authorities agree that nobody and nothing substitute for a child's parents&mdash;mother and father ideally. Studies in bonding and attachment theory have shown that a child's emotional and mental wellbeing are closely related to the level of contact between, particularly&mdash;whether you like it or not&mdash;a mother and her child. One study concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Children deprived of parental care in early childhood are likely to be withdrawn, disruptive, insecure or even intellectually stunted.</PARA>
<PARA>They are not my words; I am quoting them from a so-called expert. We could even read `and uncivilised' into that, dare I use such a word. The Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), used that word in that broad context recently and the press picked it up; the politically correct out there grabbed it and ran with it and distorted it and twisted it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Hyde pointed out in his column in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 7 January that Norman Dennis, writing for the London thinktank the Institute of Economic Affairs, looks at crime and broken families and makes a connection regarding the functional family, whose children, in Mr Dennis's words, are more likely to become civilised&mdash;again using that word in its proper sense&mdash;than those who have not had that advantage, that is, the advantage of a proper functional family and proper parental care and involvement. Of course, John Hyde in his column recognises, and the honourable member for Gwydir certainly found out, that that&mdash;and I quote John Hyde&mdash;`is a singularly politically incorrect conclusion but one that may have the virtue of truth'. As one family expert put it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In three decades of work as a social scientist, I know of few other bodies of data in which the weight of evidence is so decisively on one side of the issue. On the whole, for children, two-parent families are preferable to single-parent families and step families.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, we all know of happy single parent families and unhappy two-parent families. I was just talking to one of my own staff before I came down here who is a single mum. She has four wonderful children, all of them university educated. So I do not dispute for a moment that there are not very good children who are the results of single parents. What I am saying is that this is not the ideal. It is not me who is saying that; it is all of the experts who say that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case for the two-parent family is not&mdash;and I underline this for the benefit of the honourable member for Forde, who will have the opportunity to speak after me, and who I am sure will take the opportunity to say something on this&mdash;about knocking single parent families. To highlight the importance of two-parent families is not to denigrate those who find themselves, often through no fault of their own, in the position of being single parents. I emphasise this for the benefit of the honourable member opposite, because do I not want to be misrepresented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are that, by a number of indicators, children from intact, stable two-parent families will do much better than children from broken homes or single parent families. The experts say that. I think it is commonsense by and large, but the experts who have done decent studies on it conclude that. I have not seen anything that refutes that contention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of studies show that children from mother-only families attain fewer years of education and are far more likely to drop out of high school than children from intact families. A number of studies show a very real connection between delinquent or criminal behaviour and broken families. Those opposite might not like that and might want to say, `Hang on, that is putting down single parent families', but I emphasise that it is not. These are facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Suicide rates also tend to be higher amongst those from broken homes. That is probably understandable, too, up to a point. For example, a statistically significant incidence of separation and divorce has been observed in the families of adolescents who attempt suicide as compared with others in controlled groups. All of this reinforces the importance of parents to children. That is the only reason I am making these points and putting them on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parents are important to children. Some people probably think that that is not the case. I do not think that the social engineers, many people in the government and the minister, in particular, are really prepared to accept, other than in some general terms, that parents are important to kids. I listened to some of them and I actually think they believe that parents are dangerous for kids and that kids are better off away from their parents. There may be the odd or obscure small percentage of cases where that is true, but I am saying that the vast majority of kids are better off being cared for by their parents. The more parent care they get when they are young, I suspect that as they get older the better off they are. They cannot get enough of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to hear someone argue against that in the vast majority of cases. I ask honourable members opposite not to get up and trot out, `There are 20,000 kids who are abused every year'&mdash;or however they want to define that. We are talking about millions of kids who are better off with continual exposure to their parents&mdash;the more, the better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask those opposite, in respect of this particular legislation: does this legislation really recognise the importance of parent care? On my analysis of it, the answer has to be a resounding no. In fact, this legislation really focuses attention on how fundamentally flawed this government's approach to supporting the family really is. Everything this government has done and continues to do is dictated by minorities, such as extreme feminists. I am not talking about feminists in general. I am very reluctant to do that when the honourable member for Forde is going to follow me in this debate. I am talking about extreme feminists. </PARA>

But, unfortunately, the job culture which some of these extreme feminists have created has totally invaded the family culture&mdash;overtaken and thrown out the family culture&mdash;and the children have suffered. As I said at the outset, that is what this debate is ultimately all about in the Year of the Family. The kids are important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A rapidly growing share of our children are being raised by hired workers&mdash;by substitute parents. All of the research confirms that this is not ideal. Let me state quite clearly&mdash;also on the record so that people cannot take issue with this&mdash;I cast no aspersion on the qualifications or motivations of those who work in or operate child-care centres. There is a place for professional child care. There is a place, as the honourable member for Moreton was saying, for occasional, respite, part day care or whatever we want to call it. My criticism is not of those who work in child-care centres because they are just caught up in it. The people that are building the child-care centres are taking advantage of the system the government has created. My criticism is of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's laissez faire approach to child-care funding&mdash;as it was with nursing home funding until it woke up to what was going on&mdash;has seen a huge proliferation in child-care centres. As my wife observed quite cleverly the other day, instead of corner stores, we now have corner kindies. Every time we go down the road there is a new one popping up. There has been no real attempt, as far as I can see, on behalf of this government or any government to ensure this proper targeting of government funding to meet the needs of a certain area. It depends on the local council. Child-care centres are popping up everywhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What really has been missing in this huge child-care boom, which is going on and which is underwritten by the taxpayers of this country, is planning and targeting. The federal government has effectively given an open cheque to speculators in allowing 85 per cent of fees to be subsidised for those on low incomes&mdash;interestingly, whether they are working or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even on that issue I can never quite figure out the rationale for, say, an unemployed couple who, unfortunate as they may be&mdash;I do not want to sound uncompassionate here because I need to be PC on that issue as well&mdash;have to go looking for jobs and then putting one of their young children in child care five days a week. Why? Because they get an 85 per cent subsidy. Because they can get it for 32c an hour. Why would we put that incentive there? Why would we tempt them with that sort of incentive? It just does not make sense to me why the taxpayers should be paying unemployment benefits on the one hand and giving those unemployed a full subsidy to have their children minded 50 hours a week on the other hand. I am not suggesting that there is not a need for respite care to give them time to go looking for jobs, or to study, or to do whatever, but surely there is something wrong with the extent of this. That is the point that I am making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sad fact is, ultimately, that many couples do not have any choice about who cares for their young children. I say sad because it is a sad fact. The parents would like to choose parent care, but the financial realities for them are otherwise. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) tried to tell us yesterday that buying a house was now within the reach of every couple in Australia. Of course, that is not true. The reality is different, as many young couples are finding out. They both must work if they are to have any chance of making mortgage payments on a new home, let alone the cost of electricity, rates, taxes, pest control or anything else that people have to put into their budget when they are trying to buy a house. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's whole approach has been to create incentives for mothers of young children to enter the work force. Why? Surely not, as Mike Seccombe suggests in his article in last week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, because women are needed by the national economy. What about the one million people who are already unemployed? They are needed in the national economy as well. Ironically, it is the increasing participation rates of women in the work force&mdash;do not necessarily get me wrong here, please, because I understand that women can choose to work, and that is great&mdash;which have created the whole unemployment problem in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To make the point even more strongly, when we are talking about the home child care allowance of $30 a week, the maximum rebate for work related child care is over $60, but it goes further. Low income earners with children, including&mdash;we might observe once again&mdash;the unfortunate unemployed, can actually get up to $92.50 a week for 50 hours care in a child centre. The debate in this matter has only just begun, not just tonight on this particular legislation, but on this whole area of what is best for families and what is best for kids. It is my contention, carefully considered I might add, that the government has it all wrong. The big question is, `What is best for children'? The government, in its enthusiasm for social engineering, has lost sight of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every bit of this government's approach ultimately is anti-family. Its industrial relations policy perpetuates unemployment and is biased against part-time work to allow time for families. Its tax system precludes income splitting, which would benefit marriages and which provide a financial incentive for non-earning spouses to enter the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the social security system then becomes enormously complex and almost unworkable as the government attempts to apply bandaids to a society which is haemorrhaging all over the place. The sad fact is that the solutions to many of these problems are simple, but not politically correct. Many mothers of young children who work would choose not to if they could. They have said that. The government could fascinate such a choice by paying the home child-care allowance at a realistic level; one that would put a true value on the service which is provided by the stay at home parent. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there have been some sidetracks into discussing the kinds of issues that the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) has raised, we have to remember that over 80 per cent of our families are a reflection of the kind of traditional family that we have here and that 13 per cent of our families are sole parent, with 94 per cent of those being headed by women. I know that statistics are drawn out and we ask, `What kind of children are best? Who does best? Who is richest?' and so on but what we do know in all the research is that the most important factors in any child's life are love and being cared for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If children are surrounded by love and by caring, then those children grow up in an atmosphere in which they recognise themselves as a human being with dignity and they then can go on and so develop. But, of course, that is not always possible. We have very many people whose marriages have deteriorated and broken up. We have people whose husbands die, such as many of our war heroes, and so many women find themselves in the situation of being on their own with their children.

I say to honourable members opposite that in terms of fee relief we have the priority of access guidelines. Places in those centres have to be determined in an ordered and orderly fashion. If perchance there are people out there who are finding loopholes through the system, we have to say that those people and those child-care centre owners are the ones who are abusing the system. It is not the government which has established a very clear priority of access in response to what the community says it needs relating to the way in which it likes to delegate child care. Of course that is so. Child-care centres are part of our family. They are part of our children's growing up. They are part of our culture. They are there because this community and this society have shown us that they want to participate in the economic life of our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am always somewhat bemused by people who suggest that there is somehow something terribly strange with women working. This argument has only emerged since women have got equal pay and have received considerably better jobs within our community. Prior to equal pay, very many women&mdash;poor women in our community&mdash;have always worked. They worked as housekeepers, cleaners and in factories. Women have worked for generations and for hundreds of years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we read about the Industrial Revolution in Britain, we read the terrible stories about women actually having babies on the floor of those factories while the mills continued to roll and about women in the coalmines with their children working. Nobody suggested that somehow that was a terrible thing until, in fact, we had social reformers. We saw poor women in this community work for very little pay. Nobody raised a question of that. It is only now that we have equal pay for women, that women have access to universities, to colleges, to highly paid and other decision making jobs in our community that suddenly it is wrong for women to work. I find it quite extraordinary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This community and our society today are about choice.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it somewhat ironic from those opposite who are from the conservative side of politics that somehow hired child-care workers are somewhat strange. The biggest users of hired workers and nonparental carers are the royal family and the monarchy. Somehow those opposite say to us, `This is the person who is to be admired and whom we must revere. These are the kind of people we want to control our world'. Yet in the next breath they tell us that children who are reared by hired workers are somehow second best and that they have not got the best kind of image. Surely members of the conservative opposition must see the paradox in those kinds of arguments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side say to those opposite that child care and child raising are about love, care and concern. It is also a recognition that child care is a difficult and an expensive job.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that traditionally in this community women have always done a huge amount of volunteer work. I might say that it is still women who are doing the caring, despite the fact that they have entered the work force&mdash;albeit many of them part time to accommodate their volunteer work in the community. They are in paid work a couple of days a week and give the rest of their time to tuckshops, meals on wheels and various other family commitments which they have, be it caring for their aged parents, elderly grandparents, parents-in-law, sisters or whatever. It is not just a question of the kind of child care and caring for children in the home that very many of our families find themselves in. Indeed, the Year of the Family celebrates the joy with which families support each other. It is the joy that comes from being part of that family and being part of a caring and supportive system that this government recognises through the kinds of allowances which we have here in this bill. </PARA>

Indeed, the changing nature of work has meant that very many people's jobs have gone. </PARA>

It has modernised; it is more productive&mdash;all the kinds of things we hear lauded as being important. So our driving force must be to find new industries to enable people to be accommodated as the work force changes. </PARA>

I think perhaps we forget that houses have doubled in size from 12 to 22 squares; that people now have access to a whole range of communication services&mdash;cars, transport and other things&mdash;not to mention health and education services which existed in that period for a very small group of people in our community. </PARA>

It is not a question of the government taking the lead; it is a question of the government responding to the needs of our community. As women and families demand child care of a different kind, as we see shifts in the way in which the work force operates, as we see the different roles that people may or may not have in their families, we as a government respond and say, `Yes, this will help you; this is for your support'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am quite horrified at the support for and the stories that have been around for some time about income splitting. I take people back to the inquiry into equal status for women in Australia and its subsequent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Halfway to equal</EMPHASIS> report. Indeed, there was a certain amount of discussion in that report on income splitting. I think we all would acknowledge that income splitting is of great advantage to the wealthier people in our community. We as a government have traditionally looked at those families which are in need and which we believe are deserving of our support. That is why we target our funding. That is why we have means testing. That is why we have priority needs. That is why we actually ensure that the people who are most in need receive our income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was somewhat horrified to hear an opposition speaker earlier complaining about the drop and change in the nature of the family allowance, that those families who are on $64,000 a year and were receiving family allowance are now no longer receiving it. Let me tell honourable members that in my electorate there are not very many people on $64,000 a year raising families. Most people who live very close to my electorate office and who are in receipt of the allowance are families that are probably on a third of that kind of income. Those people are very grateful for the family support they receive. I know that they welcome the home child-care allowance. For many of them, the dependent spouse rebate really meant very little. They do not pay or were not paying the level of tax which ensured that they could get the full benefit from that income tax rebate. While they have cash in their hands, they can actually purchase school shoes, clothing and family needs for their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the members of the opposition to welcome these home child-care and partner allowances in the spirit in which they have been made.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate about the sorts of families we have and who are families is really very much a sidetracking of the issue. We have families of all sorts. Families bring us joy; families care for their members, be they children, adults, older people, extended families, next-door neighbours or whoever. All of those people make up families. The joy which families bring to individuals and to our community is what we are celebrating in this 1994 International Year of the Family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ensure that families are supported, that families are recognised and that families in all their shapes and sizes care for children. That care has to be recognised. We support them with this cash home child-care rebate. The same is true for the partner allowance in that partners support each other and they too form families. The question here is whether they have dependent children. That partner allowance is also an acknowledgment that people support each other and an acknowledgment that all families need to be looked after. That partner allowance, together with the home child-care allowance, is a cash payment that people can use each week and each fortnight in a meaningful way to meet the needs of those families. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debate that will take place during this International Year of the Family will be an interesting one because I believe that it will show that sound and happy families, children and parents together, produce adults who are sound and well adjusted and that they are of economic and social benefit to the community. I hope that this process does not become a competition between people saying that there is one form of a family that is equal to all others and, therefore, there is no preferable form of family. Study after study, psychological report after psychological report, research after research, Australia-wide and internationally, clearly demonstrate that the preferable family form for raising children is two parents, a mother and a father, together with the children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer honourable members to a presidential report into urban families called for by the mayors of United States cities. In calling for the report, the mayors stated that it was their view that rising rates of family break-up were driving the United States major problems&mdash;crime, drugs, addiction, poverty, mental illness and falling school achievement&mdash;with immediate repercussions for the economy and the United States international competitiveness. I believe that by the end of this year the view held by US urban mayors, who said that their society had to cope with problems that were created by family break-up and the destruction of the family, will be firmly established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think it is a matter of looking back to the 1950s and 1960s, as the previous speaker hinted. It is a matter of looking at the really difficult problems in our society and asking: are we best trying to do a patch up job on the problems after they have occurred; or can we, as a society, analyse where some of these problems start and take remedial steps before they begin? That is what the government is failing to acknowledge during this debate. But I need to acknowledge the effectiveness of this small part of what I hope is a more extensive program of substance that the government may reveal during 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the government has done is taken the spouse allowance and directed it to the child carer. In that process, an additional 55,000 families become eligible for a benefit that they would not have otherwise received, and for those who already receive that benefit, it is directed to the carer, whether it be male or female. So that redirection of those resources is interesting and adequate. Even so, it has some shortcomings. The value of the spouse rebate is about $27 a week on average across the Australian community. Carers can now claim up to a maximum of $30 a week, so it is more targeted, a bit more restricted and, generally, I think a welcome process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble is that a two-income family would also gain a benefit that is roughly worth about $40 a week. In order to restore some equity in what the government is doing, a maximum of $40 a week would seem to be a more reasonable approach rather than limiting it to $30 a week. However, the government jumped on the bandwagon during the election campaign and said, `We are going to look after families with children'. People actually believed that this was an additional amount and that there was genuine intent behind the government's expressed concern. That has been proved wrong. It is not an additional amount; it is basically a redirection of funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer honourable members to some important comments which I think are foundational. Mr Brian Burdekin has blamed the breakdown of the traditional family in Australia for soaring levels of child abuse. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> on 28 August 1993 Mr Burdekin pointed out that 70 to 80 per cent of child abuse cases in Melbourne come from non-nuclear, non-traditional families. Mr Burdekin declared his alarm at the apparent 500 per cent increase in sexual abuse of girls in families where the adult male was not the natural father. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer honourable members to a statement&mdash;and I think it is foundational&mdash;by Nathan Glazer, Professor of Social Structure at Harvard. In the publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commentary</EMPHASIS>, he wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On balance, it would seem that certain traditional arrangements, whether they are biologically determined or have been learned at some primordial stage of social development, work pretty well, and that despite the age-old hopes of radicals of both Left and Right, there is no better way to raise children than the family (as Churchill said of democracy, it is the worst way&mdash;except for all the others). </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Daniel Moynihan made an interesting statement in the publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nation and family</EMPHASIS> when he wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A nation without a conscious family policy leaves to chance and mischance an area of social reality of the utmost importance, which in consequence will be exposed to the untrammelled and frequently thoroughly undesirable impact of policies arising in other areas.</PARA>
<PARA>These writers are saying that we need to look at the foundations of our society and decide whether or not they are beneficial, and I would vote yes every time. Despite the facts that are often publicly presented in the press, I would go back to Brian Burdekin's statement because that is a thorough analysis and no-one can doubt his objectivity in this area. He has made it very clear that a family with a natural father and mother is by far the best way of avoiding child abuse&mdash;particularly sexual abuse of girls. We can point to other statistics; there is plenty of information&mdash;heaps of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What will the government do during this year? The government has made its first tentative step&mdash;and it is nothing more than that. It cannot be held up as some great innovation. It has taken funds already there and redirected them, albeit in a more thoughtful manner. The process is basically revenue neutral. But what will happen during the rest of the year when Australia's taxation, social welfare, and community support systems and institutions have to cope with families and their problems, and try to treat them as individuals?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia would have perhaps the most individualised taxation system in the world. There are few that can match the individualised process in the Australian tax system. That is one area that needs close attention. We need to draw on experience and examples and deal with hard facts, not emotion, in looking at the results of different tax systems and see whether, in fact, they are more beneficial to Australian families than the current Australian taxation system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Bureau of Statistics produced a report that said that 80 per cent of people living in one home are still recognisable as traditional families, while only six per cent are de facto families. Nevertheless, under pressure of both the law and the media, an increasing number of people are refusing to enter into any legal relationship at all. An increasing number of people in de facto relationships do not live in the same house. If the law, through the processes of government, encourages that process, we ought to make an assessment of whether that is an effective role for government. Is the government being positive or negative in its impact on society? Is it catering to small group pressure or cries that at the time seem worthy but when analysed prove to be detrimental if applied broadly?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has been tardy in its establishment of a program for the International Year of the Family compared with the International Year for the World's Indigenous People. I understand that we are now into a decade for indigenous people. A working party was set up twelve months prior to the start of the International Year for the World's Indigenous People. It was only in the latter months of 1993 that the government focused any attention whatsoever on the International Year of the Family. For those who think this is a right wing conservative sort of issue, the International Labour Organisation, in its report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Women workers in a changing world</EMPHASIS>, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No woman should be forced by economic circumstances to work outside her home . . . Women with family responsibilities, particularly those with young children, should be able to stay at home if they wish so. As has often been emphasised, the incontestable right of every mother to remain within the home and to bring up her children herself should be protected and respected. This emphasises the general desirability of formulating and implementing fiscal and social policy which would enable such women to stay at home if they so choose.</PARA>
<PARA>So there cannot and should not be a factional or political process of the Left or Right involved in this situation. There are plenty of people with barrows to push; I acknowledge that. They should identify which barrow they are pushing and what sort of impact they want to have on our society, whether it is beneficial or whether it is a narrow interest to suit their own particular preferences or their own preconceived ideas about what is best for our society. If it is one or the other, then surely it cannot be contemplated when governments consider the broad issues of family. These interests should be listened to, taken into account but not contemplated when looking at the broad issue of establishing effective family policies in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 28 July 1993 reported the release of a research paper by EPAC, the government's own research body. That paper indicates that single income families are in many cases under substantial financial pressure. This was a comparative study which looked across the board at those people in our society who are suffering and those who are not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The net impact of the government's last budget and its previous policies has been to disadvantage single income families as compared with the rest of society. That ought to be rectified. If we add up the financial advantages of tax decisions and social policy decisions, such as child care and access, we find that the single income family has been the most seriously disadvantaged. The government has not chosen to rectify this situation. In fact, it is parading the decisions of today as a positive support for single income families. But the government has failed to acknowledge that the decisions of its last budget will leave families in Australia worse off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst those on incomes below $55,000 will receive an additional benefit of up to $30 a week, we can write off on average $5 of that in additional costs brought about by the increases in indirect taxes and fuel taxes. We can quantify those increases. The Treasurer (Mr Willis) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) cannot deny that low income families and those dependent on their own private transport to get to and from work are the ones that are being disadvantaged. Those families live mainly in the western suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party has set out almost consciously to hurt most of those people it claims to support. During the recent by-election in Werriwa, the Liberal candidate said that the Labor Party attitude to Macquarie Fields was a ghetto mentality. He was not saying that the people of Macquarie Fields were ghetto people. He was not making a reflection on individuals. The fact of the matter is that the results of the poll indicate very clearly that the people living in that area agreed with the statements of the Liberal Party candidate. They knew they had been rejected. They knew the Labor Party was prepared to rubbish them and grind them down. So if there was a swing in that electorate that demonstrated a recognition of the government's biased treatment of our community, it was right there in Macquarie Fields, the area that the Prime Minister took a spin through just to prove that he did not think they were ghetto people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whatever we do in this House must be aimed at the long-term future of this nation and the long-term future of our children. Policies to secure that future are central to our policy making role. The home child-care allowance, which is central to this bill, is a very good initiative which will strengthen the array of government policies to protect and strengthen the family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The home child-care allowance shows that this government is financially committed to those people who choose to do unpaid work in the home caring for children. In this International Year of the Family, it is a very important initiative which should receive far greater credit from the opposition than it has done so far in this debate. For example, the opposition has said that this measure is revenue neutral. This measure will result in the additional expenditure of $226 million in 1996-97. It reflects the government's continued commitment, through an array of policies, to support the family and the care of children, be it through a home child-care allowance which looks after those who seek, in an unpaid capacity, to care for children in the home, or whether it be through other child-care initiatives which are the subject of election commitments from last year. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The maximum rate of this allowance will be $1,560 per annum or $60 per fortnight. This rate will be subject to an income test based on the income of the person receiving the allowance. This allowance is approximately $6 per fortnight higher than the current maximum rate for the dependent spouse rebate. As I said before, this measure is not revenue neutral; it involves substantial additional expenditure by the government to support Australian families, which is entirely appropriate in this International Year of the Family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with the existing dependent spouse rebate is that it is provided in recognition of the fact that the cost of supporting dependants reduces a person's capacity to pay tax in comparison with a person who does not have dependants. The clear advantage of the home child-care allowance is that it recognises the work of the carer and pays money directly to the carer. That is the significance of this measure. In that sense, it is a path-breaking reform which deserves some credit from the opposition. It goes to the heart of commitments that this government made in the 1993 federal election campaign. Through this initiative we have promised $6 per fortnight more than was promised in that campaign. In addition to that, low income families who receive no benefit from the dependent spouse rebate will be major beneficiaries&mdash;to the tune of 55,000 additional families. On top of that, as I said before, they will receive an extra $6 per fortnight over and above that which was promised during the campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The home child-care allowance is a payment directly to full-time carers or even part-time carers of children, who are usually women. This stands in stark contrast to the absence of any policy from the opposition in the area of family support or in the area of child care. I know that some members of the coalition are fiddling with income splitting options which are generally, but not always, regressive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major advantage of this initiative, which I hope the government can build on over time, is that it will provide additional support to families on low and middle incomes in a way in which income splitting measures, such as those that have been put forward by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), cannot do. Clearly, full income splitting favours high income families, if it is done in an unrestrained way, to the detriment of low income families. Some of the options that have been canvassed but which are not opposition policy are clearly very regressive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past month we have seen some statements from various opposition spokesmen in this area. For example, we had a statement from Senator Vanstone who recently told a Young Liberal conference that the sorts of policies that the Liberal Party needs can be compared to a bus. Senator Vanstone said that people were not interested in the seats or the brakes; they were only interested in the general direction in which the bus was going. The fact is that in policy terms, be it policy terms for child care or policy terms for the support of a family, the opposition is careering out of control without any brakes, seats or general direction. That is a sad thing in this International Year of the Family where we should be having a mature and informed debate about those policies which can best support the family, those policies which can best support the unpaid carers of children, and those policies which can best support the carers of children who may, through their own desire or through no desire of their own, have to go to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Support for families is about giving families genuine choice. The reason why the home child-care allowance is so central to support for strengthening the family is that it gives families a greater capacity to make a choice as to whether the carer of the children, be they male or female, decides to stop in the home in an unpaid capacity or decides to go into the work force. It is about providing choice. In that sense, it complements a range of policies that this government has put in place over many years to support the family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I only have to mention this government's major initiatives in terms of family allowance payments and the family income supplement. On top of that, we now have the home child-care allowance and, for those who choose to work and have to buy their child care on the open market, we have the child-care rebate. These are very significant measures. Over a decade or so this government has put together a comprehensive array of policies to support the family and, in many ways, the home child-care allowance is probably one of the most significant because, for the first time, it provides assistance to the unpaid carer of children in the home who so desire to do that. The emphasis here, once again, is on choice and on freedom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the opposition have to say about all of this? It has had very little to say, except for making some very down-beat assessments of the home child-care allowance in this House today and, in particular, claiming that it is revenue neutral, that is, it is some sort of meaningless initiative which will be of no benefit to unpaid carers of children. When this measure commences in September and the $60 a fortnight arrives in tens of thousands or up to a million Australian homes, it will be supported. The assessments that those opposite have given it will be looked on very dimly by the Australian people as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This tends to reflect the `Fightback' attitude that the opposition displayed throughout last year and in the years before that. It is best summed up by what the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) told us of what he thinks about helping people. He said, `If you bend down to help people they drag you down'. That is exactly the kind of laissez-faire approach to policy that is hostile to the family and hostile to the care of children. It must be resisted. It is resisted and this government is moving forward with further initiatives to support the family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This initiative is something that full-time carers of children, who are mainly women, have wanted for some time. A recent survey conducted by the Australian Institute of Family Studies found that 40 per cent of women employed during pregnancy did not return to work after the birth of their child. Those families suffer. They have additional costs to clothe, feed and look after the children and, of course, they suffer a loss of income. The home child-care allowance recognises that. I for one would like to do better than the $60 a fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have this debate about how we best look after families in the future and whether or not we change the taxation system to move to some form of income splitting, we will have to have a debate about how we best provide funds on a targeted basis to low and middle income families so that they can best secure freedom of choice as to whether they want to look after their children in the home or whether they want to return to the work force. This initiative is about choice and as such it is very important. The Institute of Family Studies survey has not been recognised by those opposite who simply come into the House and make remarks in a stereotypical way which really do not go to the heart of the problem of how we support families. As I said before, family support has been central to this government's policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past 10 years, families in the low income bracket have seen an increase in their real disposable income of quite substantial proportions. A single income family earning three-quarters of average weekly earnings has experienced an increase of 18.7 per cent in real disposable income. A similar family, where the sole wage earner is unemployed and is receiving jobsearch or newstart, will receive over 30 per cent more in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More recently, the government has recognised the situation of Australian families through its taxation policy and through tax cuts by bringing the marginal rate for families earning between $20,000 and $38,000 a year down from 38c to 34c in the dollar. That is a very substantial initiative to support Australian families in this community. But the attitude of the opposition to that measure was to oppose it as if somehow it was fair to tax people earning $26,000 a year 38c in the dollar on each marginal dollar of income when average weekly earnings in this country are around $30,000. If we put together the tax cuts, the family allowance, the family income supplement and the home child-care allowance and add to that the child-care rebates that are forthcoming, what we have is very substantial support for the Australian family. It is the sort of policy package which is having real benefits in our community, the sort of policy package which the opposition is simply not capable of putting together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking after families, however, is not just a matter of money, it is a matter of attitude. It is also true that if we are going to have secure, healthy and caring families, we have to encourage fathers to play a wider role in homemaking, in child care and in child growth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the dinner break I was talking about policies to protect the living standards of Australian families and how the home child-care allowance was the very initiative to do that. I was speaking about how our tax system, in particular the recent tax cuts, was designed to assist Australian families. I also spoke about how our social security system&mdash;the family allowance payments, the family income supplement, and the health care system, particularly through Medicare&mdash;contained very important initiatives to protect and assist the Australian family. The home child-care allowance is just one of the latest of a number of initiatives from this government to support the family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give one example of what this government does for families. A two-child family with a combined income of $28,000 a year, privately renting, currently receives $64.96 per week from basic family payment, additional family payment and rent assistance. In addition to this, it would receive a further $30 per week from the home child-care allowance. This is the sort of initiative which recognises the importance of the family and particularly assists single income families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we are talking about the International Year of the Family and support for families, we should not just be talking about money; it is important that we recognise the changes in society. It is important, for example, that we encourage fathers to play wider roles in homemaking, child care and child growth and that women should be enabled to explore new opportunities for education and employment so that all the carers in the family can balance work, family responsibilities and the care of children. This is just one initiative which encourages the sort of opportunity and freedom of choice that I was speaking about earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we are talking about families, we should be talking not just about the full-time carers in the family but also about older folk in the community, such as grandparents, who also have an important nurturing role to play in the stability of families. In turn, we must put in place policies to assist older folk in the community. We have done that through programs such as the home and community care program. It is important that we debate support for the family not only in terms of living standards but also in terms of care and compassion in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important in this International Year of the Family that we should not waste our time on sterile debates about what constitutes a family. There is far too much stereotyping in this debate. We should not be typecasting individuals into any role that they are uncomfortable with. Many women are happy to stay at home on a full-time basis. This is also increasingly the case for some men. We should not look down on those people who make the choice to stay home, just as we should not look down on those people who make the choice to go back to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have to ensure, in terms of government policies, particularly those which impact on the financial capacity of the family, is that people have that legitimate choice and that one part of the family is not necessarily forced into the work force even though he or she would prefer to remain at home, or forced to remain at home when he or she would prefer to go to work. This is why the array of child-care policies that the government is presenting in the International Year of the Family is so important. We have a balanced policy. We are recognising the importance of the carer who wishes to stay at home in an unpaid capacity. We are also recognising the importance of those who seek to go to work to meet their child-care needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also some debate about the type of taxation system that we require to support single income families. I said earlier that elements of the opposition favour full income splitting and that full income splitting can be very regressive. Our existing taxation system encourages non-earning spouses&mdash;who usually are married women&mdash;to enter the labour force rather than stay at home. That is a consequence of our progressive system of taxation, but it does not necessarily follow that making our taxation system regressive will solve this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the sort of income splitting arrangements that the opposition is talking about, a family in which the income earner earns $100,000 a year and the partner earns no income would derive an enormous benefit from any form of income splitting that was given to it; whereas a family in which the principal breadwinner earns $28,000 a year and the spouse earns $5,000 a year would gain very little benefit from income splitting. That is why the home child-care allowance is the perfect alternative to the regressive form of income splitting that elements of the opposition are putting forward in this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have to do is target the assistance to the carer in a way which is fair to low and middle income earners. I am not talking just about those people who are earning a combined income of $20,000 or $25,000 a year; I am talking also about the great bulk of Australian families, with household incomes somewhere between $25,000 and $50,000 a year. The sorts of arrangements for income splitting that are being put forward by the opposition would disadvantage those types of families dramatically and advantage families which have a higher aggregate income, albeit from only one income earner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are hearing from the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and others about income splitting being a fair way to support single income earners is simply arrant nonsense. It is demonstrably very unfair. An alternative to that from this side of the House is the home child-care allowance, which at this stage is $60 a fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be my hope that over time in government we could further support the Australian family by adding to that allowance as an alternative to the inequitable arrangements for income splitting which are being supported by the opposition, which would simply deliver great benefits to people on very high incomes and negative benefits to the great bulk of Australian families with modest and low incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that in this House over the months ahead, right through the International Year of the Family, we can continue this debate and that a home child-care allowance can be viewed, in a sense, as a mechanism for limited income splitting, largely addressing the regressive nature of full income splitting, which is being put forward by the opposition. The 1994 International Year of the Family should be a year in which we reflect upon issues relating to the family other than just financial issues. A great deal has been said about the importance of the family and the need to promote policies which incorporate core family values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude on the point that we should accept the differing family arrangements that exist in the 1990s. What was normal when we were growing up is not necessarily normal or relevant now. Changes come from the growth of society&mdash;changes in the work force and the explosion of the media, as well as an increasing awareness of choice and civil and political rights. Change is inevitable. However, some basics do not change. The notion of the family, however it is constructed, and in particular the traditional family, should remain fundamentally important to our community and our future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, we should not look down on those parents who choose to work. Equally, we should not look down on those parents who genuinely choose to stay at home. They are all very important parts of the Australian family. I believe that this bill reaffirms the government's commitment to the family. I commend it to the House. </PARA>

I hope that this is not the end of initiatives and proposals that come to grips with the vital issues confronting Australia's families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I concur wholeheartedly with much of what was said by the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan). I think we all warmly welcome the many pious statements we hear in support of the family. I do not very often agree with the sentiments and comments of the Queensland Premier, Mr Goss, but I have to say that some of the things he was quoted as saying in front-page newspaper columns in Queensland over recent weeks are thoroughly commendable and represent the kind of attitude that may indeed come to grips with the important future role of families in his state and, indeed, the rest of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the policies of Mr Goss's government have not always supported the rhetoric. In a sense, the same can be said for some things that the honourable member for Swan has just said. The government's rhetoric usually is not supported by too much evidence of positive actions in support of Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been said, this is the Year of the Family. It is interesting to note that in 1984 Queensland had a Year of the Family. It has taken the United Nations 10 years to catch up to Queensland. I think that Year of the Family was a very successful event for the state. It had a high profile, local committee led by former Senator Bjelke-Petersen, which was able to mobilise an enormous amount of community goodwill and set up organisations right across the state to help promote activities and issues which were of importance to Queensland families. I hope that a similar spirit can be captured one decade on in Australia as well&mdash;in the nation as a whole&mdash;as we celebrate our national Year of the Family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, there have been so many international years over recent times that it has become difficult to engender any kind of enthusiasm for new proposals. People think it is yet another year and ask what the year is dedicated to this time. I think there has been an element of that in the federal government's response so far to the Year of the Family. It really has been disappointedly half-hearted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national council for the Year of the Family has only a very small budget and did not even meet for the first time until last September. No effort has been made to promote the  establishment of local community committees or to promote a program of activities for the year. In fact, I cannot recall getting anything in my office from the Year of the Family committee at all, yet we are one month into the year. At the launching speech of the council by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in December, I was concerned also by the government seeking to use the International Year of the Family to further its politically correct agenda by including any and every combination of living arrangement in its definition of families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that 86 per cent of Australian families are couple families and 82 per cent of children are growing up in couple families. So it is still the norm in our country to have two parents and children make up a family. Of course, children living with sole parents are also families and often need special care and attention. Indeed, special programs often are going to be necessary to make up for the gap of not having two loving parents. Often one loving parent is better than two feuding parents, so those circumstances need to be recognised and accepted as we develop attitudes towards Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Year of the Family gives us a wonderful opportunity to focus government and community attention on the essential role of strong and happy families in building a healthy society and a successful nation. I think it is essential that not only should we have a national committee but also we should organise events at the local level so there can be genuine input from every local group into fostering the needs of families and interests in family issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought the economics editor of the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> made some very telling comments on 4 January&mdash;an economics editor, not one who may be regarded as having special links with the family. Tim Colebatch said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone respects the family. Everyone professes concern for it. And yet when we look at how families are treated by government policies, one can only marvel at how much is out of skew, in how many areas our policy structures are at war with our professed ideals:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic cost of family breakdown is the least important part of it, yet the Marriage Guidance Council estimates it at $2.5 billion a year. And the Government spends only $20 million a year on marriage guidance to prevent it. That is poor social policy and lousy economics.</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, that is the case. When there is a breakdown in a family, the financial cost is only the smallest part of it. The real cost lies in the tragedy of human lives, the bitterness associated with the breakdown, the often intense hatred that develops between formerly loving partners and, sadly, the children who are caught in the middle&mdash;innocent victims of an unhappy relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So often our government and our communities spend their time picking up the pieces, mending the broken bottles when it would have been so much better to spend time making sure that the relationship did not break down in the first place, doing what we can to support the family unit, boosting our assistance and programs that support the family, helping people with marriage guidance counselling and then parenting plans, doing much more to support and keep families together so we then do not have to face the problem of picking up the pieces of a broken relationship&mdash;a dysfunctional family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This home child-care allowance is a positive initiative, and it helps to recognise and place some financial and community values on the services provided by parents who choose to raise their children in their own home. It is in a sense, though, only a half-hearted initiative. It will offer to the parent who chooses to raise a child in his or her own home $30 a week while the government will still offer $60 a week to parents if they farm their children out to a child-care centre. So a degree of inconsistency exists there. But certainly I think the idea of paying the allowance in a cheque in the mail provides positive signals to the community that are not as evident in a tax deductible spouse rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is making out that it is spending $1.1 billion on this new initiative and quietly not recognising the $900 million that it will save by abolishing the dependent spouse rebate for parents with children. But certainly this program will better target in many ways the money provided to support parents, although there will obviously be greater administration costs. The current DSR is very simple to administer. This rebate will require considerably more work. It will, though, enable the benefit to be paid to one group of people in particular who miss out on the dependent spouse rebate at the present time&mdash;those low income earners who do not earn sufficient in order to get the full rebate. The government could have done that in another way; it could have provided the rebate as a tax credit. That would have had the same kind of effect, probably with a less administrative cost. But certainly I think there is a strong case to be mounted to ensure that those families that do not have a taxable income are able to share in the benefits that are available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we support parents who raise children in their homes. I think that over recent times both the government and the opposition have been bending over backwards to outbid one another in the number of child-care places each was going to provide around Australia. There are a lot of available child-care places in Australian homes. We have not exercised that wonderful opportunity. Instead, a boom industry has developed which is building new child-care centres around the countryside. There seems to be almost one child-care centre in every suburb at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Child-care centres will always have a role. I support the view that families ought to be in a position where they are able to make a choice between raising their children in their own home and taking advantage of a child-care facility. Indeed, I think we should look very seriously at a policy which is utterly even-handed in this regard. We should pay to parents a child-care allowance substantially more than the $30 a week which is proposed in this particular measure. Parents should then decide of their own free will whether they choose to use that payment to fund a place in a child-care centre or, alternatively, to help one of the parents raise the children in his or her own home. I think that has both enormous economic and, particularly, social advantages. It will recognise the real value to our society and to our community of the task of raising children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard a rather interesting analysis recently about how we provide taxation benefits, as a government and as a country, to industries to expand and to develop their production.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there are tremendous advantages in providing a system which enables parents to make the choice and rewards them equally or even more generously for taking the decision to raise their own children in their own household as a part of their responsibilities to their community and the country as a whole. I can recall being taught in school as a child that one of the evils of the communist system was the way in which particularly the dictatorships and the totalitarian societies would break up the families, take the children away and raise them in government run child-care centres. That was pointed out as being evil. I sometimes look at what we are doing in Australia at present with a degree of amusement, wondering whether we are heading in that direction ourselves, particularly when I see governments setting up national child-care accreditation systems where child-care centres will have to meet guidelines before fee relief is available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those government guidelines include a liberal dose of Labor's social engineering philosophies. In other words, if the boys end up playing with trucks and the girls do not get their fair share, the money stops. That is the sort of social engineering that we condemned in the worst days of the communist system. Let us make sure that we do not head in that direction in our country as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In speaking about payments to families, this government started the International Year of the Family in an extraordinary way when, as its virtual first act, it decided to cut family allowances to hundreds of thousands of Australian families&mdash;a most bizarre beginning to the year. It allowed for lower payments from 6 January to a whole range of families. I am told that around 116,000 families will lose family payments altogether. Lower income tests and assets test limits apply now to all basic family payments and fringe benefits received will be counted as income for all recipients of basic and additional family payments. This is the first time that fringe benefits have been counted in this way and it is affecting many low income families. Indeed, it is the low income families that will suffer the most as a result of this range of measures which took effect on 6 January. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lower family payments along with the increased subsidies for child care are again likely to force many families to seek a second income, even though Australia still has a million unemployed. Instead of supporting Australian families in this International Year of the Family, the federal government reduced their incomes and started the year off by making their lives a lot harder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sorry that the parliamentary secretary is not in the chamber at present because I have been exchanging correspondence with him on this matter for some time. There is a problem developing for many families, particularly those on farms and in owner-operated businesses who have widely fluctuating incomes but are required to provide income details before their financial year returns have been completed. I have been approached by accountants and others in my electorate highlighting the special problems that occurred particularly around Christmas last year. I have contacted the minister to try to draw this matter to his attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are that low income taxpayers are not required to lodge their tax returns until around 15 May. Naturally, accountants need to manage their workload throughout the year. The tax office wants higher taxpayers to put their returns in first so that they can collect from the bigger payers first. That is not unreasonable. The effect then is that the low taxpayers, the poorest people in our society, are the last to lodge their tax returns. That means that they are the last to have their financial statements prepared by the accountants. These are the people who are most likely to qualify for basic family payments and family supplements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 1 January their financial statements had not been prepared. The accountants are concentrating on people with bigger returns. So they have a difficulty. If they cannot produce estimates of income by that date, they cease to be eligible for family payments. So many poor people, particularly those in small business and in the hard-pressed rural sector, just simply do not bother to apply because it is so hard to get the figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary secretary, in replying to me, pointed out that farmers or anyone who is providing estimates on lower income can be 25 per cent out before an overpayment is raised. I acknowledge that, but 25 per cent is not a large variation, particularly when we take into account the fact that some of the farmers in my own area are being required to estimate the earnings from crops that they have not even planted yet. They are expected to be within 25 per cent range of accuracy on their income returns for the end of the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is certainly a difficulty here. I know that the current arrangements suit the majority of taxpayers and the majority of applicants, but there is a particular difficulty for those with fluctuating incomes, those who need to estimate an income in order to apply for family allowances and also, I might add, for health cards. They are unable to get that kind of financial information. That really does affect the income of their families. These are clearly the people at the bottom end of the income scale, those who are most in need of assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another interesting part of this particular legislation is the introduction of partner allowances, the way jobsearch and newstart and the like are split to make part of that payment available to the partner. That again will create an additional administrative load, but the idea obviously again has some merit in many cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While talking about partner allowances, I note that this particular measure has not been extended to the age pension where there is obviously an anomaly when it comes to partner allowances. If a 60-year-old lady qualifies for the age pension, she gets half of the age pension while her 63-year-old husband is unable to get a pension of any kind. That family is then left with only half of the age pension. If the situation is reversed in that it is a 65-year-old male who qualifies for the age pension, no matter what age his wife is&mdash;she could be only 23&mdash;she still qualifies for the partner's pension. There is a bit of sex discrimination here of the reverse kind, I guess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the government has announced that via a very slow process it is going to move to harmonise the pension eligibility age for men and women so that eventually, by about the year 2030 or whatever, this problem will go away. But I wonder whether we might be able to look at it a little earlier and look at these particular cases. Partners may be the same age; there does not need to be any disparity in their ages. If the wife is eligible for the pension at 62, her 62-year-old husband gets nothing. If they are both, say, 65 and the man is eligible, then the wife is eligible for the partner's pension. If the government is accepting the principle that there should be payments to partners, it ought to follow that through also to the age pension system and eliminate this anomaly currently in our system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think all of these issues are important for us to address, particularly in the International Year of the Family. I think the best thing we can do in our country to reduce strife, discord and trouble is encourage and strengthen the family unit. People in families help one another. Family members rejoice with other family members when they are celebrating and they share troubles. That provides vital and essential support, support which would otherwise be provided by welfare institutions and facilities of the state. We therefore have not only a social but also an economic interest in supporting Australia's families, giving them every opportunity to be strong and financially secure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure this evening to support the Social Security (Home Child Care and Partner Allowances) Legislation Amendment Bill. I thought I was going to have the double pleasure of congratulating the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) on a positive contribution to the debate this evening, but, unfortunately, just like his colleagues, he wandered off and could not help being not just critical, but also critical with half-truths. He was not telling the full truth when he told us how the government cut family allowances at the beginning of the year. He did not enunciate how it was cut so that people earning over $60,000 a year with no dependent children were removed from the dependent allowances scheme. Certainly he did not tell us that his own party, if it had been elected last year, was going to drop that limit to $55,000.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UU5">Mr HORNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course he did. These are the half-truths. The refreshing thing about the honourable member for Wide Bay is that he admitted his support for this legislation. We have heard waffle about the pea and thimble trick and our taking it from one and giving it to another. However, the opposition has denied the fact that the government will outlay an extra quarter of a billion dollars in 1995-96.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have all heard about the Anglo-Saxon Christian family unit. It has been stressed by those opposite. They have said, `Don't give money to the de factos. The children of those relationships have to be second-rate citizens'. We even heard one suggestion that child-care places for people on dual benefits virtually verges on the immoral and that to suggest that children from those families should be supported in going to preschools by this government is taboo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Wide Bay got stuck into child-care centres and how they were being forced to gain qualification by having a certain minimum standard. Is he suggesting that we return to the backyard days of the 1960s where people could not get satisfactory child care? That is the sort of thing that flourished under the coalition government in those days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because this government is making a positive move during the International Year of the Family and is bringing in initiatives to ensure a basic standard, the opposition has taken the opportunity to criticise. I assure the honourable member for Wide Bay that this is not a sole initiative. If he looks at the initiatives that have been brought in by this government, he will see that, apart from the home child-care and partner allowances, tax cuts for low wage earners came in just before Christmas; Medicare services were expanded, which those opposite will not use and which they will cut out if they ever have the opportunity of getting back onto the government benches; a fee rebate for child care was introduced; and child-care services were expanded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every one of those initiatives relates to the family and identifies this government's support for family units throughout Australia. I was particularly thankful that the honourable member identified that this initiative enunciates our care for those lower wage earners and that we are expanding child-care services for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation will give greater assistance to the most needy Australian families. It is fitting that it should be introduced in the International Year of the Family. In one way, the government's policy assists parents in the anxieties and pressures resulting from working and caring for a family at the same time. It also reflects changing attitudes to child raising and paying proper recognition to the role of nurturing the future generations of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government recognises that women are becoming more and more integrated into Australia's economic life. Their skills are essential to maintaining a competitive advantage. The work force needs the participation of women. So why would we seek to introduce legislation that would encourage them to stay out of the work force?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This piece of legislation is about the big picture. The home child-care allowance and partner allowances are not knee-jerk reactions or a cynical vote catching idea; they are just one part of a total child-care policy, just as the fee rebate for occasional child care is one part of it and the expansion of child-care places is another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These allowances are also part of the agenda of job creation. Many women in the work force are paid low wages. Many of them prefer to be at home caring for their children or only in part-time work. The home child-care allowance, which encourages child care by parents, is part of a policy of job sharing with favourable tax treatment, making it easier to have one parent at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most importantly, though, this legislation brings the role of parents to the forefront in government policy. It provides incentives for mothers or fathers who want to stay at home while their children are young. It is their right of choice, and the government is honouring its election promises to give them this choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The home child-care allowance also breaks new ground because it elevates the role of the child carer and gives it proper recognition. It recognises that while that carer&mdash;usually the mother&mdash;is at home she is entitled to acknowledgment and respect. The mother has traditionally been classified as a dependant and a tax deduction. How degrading!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition spokesperson on family affairs&mdash;a female&mdash;has criticised the home child-care allowance as being a transfer from the father's wallet to the mother's purse. That is exactly what it is and what it should be. Mothers do not want to be dependent on handouts. They do not want the indignity of having to wait for the annual tax return, which is not even paid to them personally for the work that they have done during the year. Often it is only a paper entry to pay an accumulation of bills. That is why the government is abolishing the dependent spouse rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The home child-care allowance will not be just a once a year rebate. It will be paid directly to the primary carer. It will not depend on her partner's income and it will not be subject to an assets test. It is an independent source of income. The carer will receive it in her own right each fortnight to assist her in meeting the day-to-day expenses of raising her family. For 55,000 families whose incomes are now too low to get the full dependent spouse rebate, it will be a direct cash bonus of $60 per fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The home child-care allowance is also about flexibility. It gives parents the option of entering or leaving the work force at any time during the year as their circumstances change. The pattern of Australian women's lives has changed. They spend time in the work force and some periods at home. Many will spend time doing both. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some typical scenarios. A mother may be offered part-time work at the local shop and feel that she has a suitable child carer to do her job at home. However, after a few months this may not work out. One of the children may develop a medical condition or the baby-sitting arrangements may change and she wants to be at home full time. That option is now available to her without penalty. She can take part-time work for a few weeks or months, but while she is out of the paid work force caring for her children she can claim the allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She can also do a mix and match, mixing paid employment with child raising and matching both to her family's needs. The allowance reduces at the rate of 25c for each dollar of income over $10.85 per fortnight that is earned. So she can earn $250.85 per fortnight before she loses the whole allowance. I believe that that is a major contribution to the family way of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the typical case of the woman who has been working full time, becomes pregnant, has her baby and wishes to leave the work force while her family is young. Her current income would drop to zero. However, under this legislation, she will be eligible straightaway for a fortnightly payment of $60. The strength of this reform is that it responds immediately to a family's changed financial situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Approximately 840,000 families are expected to receive this new allowance at any one time. An extra 20,000 families will receive it for part of the year. The partner allowance is designed to address inequalities arising from the abolition of the dependent spouse rebate for couples who have dependent children and who receive jobsearch, newstart, sickness allowances or special benefits. The dependent partner will be able to receive this payment directly and, as is only fair, the combined amount of allowance received by these couples will not be affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are measures that assist all Australian families. They address issues of social equity and the long-term vision for this nation. I have a great deal of pleasure in supporting them. It is symbolic that the opposition does not oppose this legislation. I know that, just like us, deep down the opposition knows it is right for Australia too. That is why it gives us on this side of the House a great deal of pleasure in making sure that this International Year of the Family will be a symbolic year; it will be year of progress; it will be a year in which the Australian government makes sure that the family way of life becomes the Australian way of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that many speakers on both sides of the House wish to contribute. I hope that, like honourable members on this side, members of the opposition take the opportunity to contribute positively, because this is truly a landmark in the way that this government is looking at Australian families. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Horne) has said, a number of members have spoken already in this debate and a number are still to come. We will probably hear a lot of the same things over again and I apologise if I repeat some of the things that have already been said. In fact, the honourable member for Paterson has already stolen a bit of my thunder; nevertheless, I will put it my way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that this legislation is being enacted in the International Year of the Family. This government has acknowledged that the family is the core of Australian society and we have had a lot of debate about what the family is. I am a single person. I live alone. I have been part of a family; I still am part of a family. Regardless of whether a family comprises a single parent, a person alone, a grandparent with a grandchild or even homosexuals&mdash;my God, we cannot even mention that word&mdash;it is a group of people who love each other, who maybe live together and who support each other. This piece of legislation is very important in supporting the family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before dealing with the legislation, I would like to put it in a historical context and describe some of the changes in the role of parenting over the years. When I left school and went to work in the 1950s, women that I worked with&mdash;I suppose one could call them girls at that age&mdash;often left work to get married. We know of women who leave work to have babies and sometimes they come back. In those days, women left work to get married. If they did not, it meant that their husbands were not capable of providing for or looking after them. At that stage my sister worked for the ABC. She was forced to leave work when she got married. That is a great contrast to the kind of situation we have today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later, in the 1960s and 1970s, we saw a great increase in the number of women in the work force. In some cases, this was of economic necessity and still is. But, in most cases, women wanted to work; they wanted a career; they wanted to be acknowledged in their own right as being something additional to a wife and a mother. They wanted that credibility. With that, eventually, came maternity leave and now paternity leave, which acknowledges the important role that men play in the family. Sometimes we can focus too much on one side of parenting. This is an acknowledgment by government departments and various employers that having a family is an important part of life; it disrupts the work flow, but it needs to be acknowledged and handled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More women in the work force inevitably led to an increase in child-care centres and child-care places. Earlier this evening the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), while spending a lot of time saying, `Don't get me wrong; I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but', made a comment that there seemed to be a child-care centre on every corner. In the olden days we used to say that there was a pub on every corner. I used to think there was a bank on every corner, but they seem to be changing into McDonalds these days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been an increase in the number of child-care centres and child-care places. In last year's budget, the government made further moves to assist in increasing the number of those child-care places. This move was made towards the target of meeting demand for work related child-care places by the year 2001. The Commonwealth has entered into direct partnerships with local government and community groups to provide 500 centre based community child-care places, and some of those have been in my electorate. In addition, 700 out of school hours care places and 4,000 family day care places are also being provided, and they will contribute to an expected overall increase in 1993-94 of 29,000 places, and that is extremely important. The before and after school care places are equally important to the child-care places for the younger children. When parents are both working, they do not get home from work at the same time as the children leave school and those places are very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some things have been said about the need for caring for children. It was said that children who do not have parental care when they are younger develop a number of problems. I certainly agree with that. The honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) in her speech hit on that very aptly when she said that what children need when they are young is love and care. That is not to say that they have to be with the parent all day. Love is something that is there, whether it is there at midday or after school, and children know that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, like most members I suppose, attend a number of child-care institutions. To see children from a very young age up to school age being so self-assured and socialised is extremely important. It may sound very old hat and very reminiscent, particularly at my age, but I can remember my first day at school. I can remember my sister's first day at school; she was two years older than I was. When I saw the terror she went through, I lived through two years of terror until it happened to me. I was one of those children who in those days stayed at home with mum, which we always did. I lived such a sheltered and cosseted life that I was terrified of anything outside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The kids who now go to child-care centres are totally socialised. When they go to school, it is a new adventure. They look forward to going to the big school. Those who denigrate child-care centres ought to go and look at those places, talk to the people who work in them, talk to the kids and talk to the mothers. I guarantee that they will find that very few of the children are deprived and if they are deprived children, it is not the child-care centres that are causing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that this government has done in the budget in support of child care is introduce the child-care cash rebate. This rebate, free of income test and providing up to $28.20 a week for one child and $61.20 per week for two or more children, will be introduced from 1 July this year. It will be for all work related child-care expenses for children up to 12 years where both parents or the sole parent are working, in training or looking for work. This is a great step forward. This initiative is expected to benefit 230,000 families and 358,000 children, and that is an awful lot of kids. Of course, we have long had the fee relief for child-care centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing that needs to be acknowledged in this progress of the family, is that more men are choosing to be the child carers. It is very interesting that we accept stereotypes, and to a great extent mothers generally are the primary carers. I have seen a number of families where it has been agreed that the mother has the more demanding career and the father is more inclined to look after the children. That is fine. It is a great step forward to see men pushing prams and walking children. When I was young we certainly did not see that. My father would never have done it. That, again, is a great step forward in the progress of the family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also need to look at that role of the wider family. We know of many cases where both parents are working or maybe, sadly, parents have been killed in an accident and grandparents take on that parenting role and do it extremely well. I am sure we are all aware of the furore caused by the Acting Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Anderson) and his comment about children needing fathers. Obviously, it is ideal for families to have two parents, but two parents fighting constantly are definitely detrimental to children and far less superior to living with one loving and caring parent. I heard a few radio phone-ins after those comments, particularly from people who have been brought up in single parent families themselves. They told of the professional careers that they were now involved in and happy with and the balanced lives that they had. So I think we need to be very careful about making judgments and calling it politically correct to say the sorts of things that I am saying now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are doing in this legislation is getting the balance right. We are saying that women, or men for that matter, should not feel guilty if they go to work when they have young children. By the same token, they should not feel guilty about wanting to stay at home and be caring parents and not yet pursue their career. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along with the child-care cash rebate, this is the other side of the coin. It allows those people to stay at home and receive those funds. The way this will work&mdash;and I am sure this has been said a million times tonight&mdash;is that the child-care allowance will be paid directly to the carer, the person who is staying home with the children. It replaces the dependent spouse rebate. That again is a rather pejorative sort of phrase. I am sure a lot has been said tonight, too, about that word `dependent'. I remember when I filled in my first tax return, my form S, the claim for wife or `daughter-housekeeper'. It was a phrase that always fascinated me. I could not work out what a `daughter-housekeeper' was. I then realised it was when there was no mum around and a daughter was looking after the poor man who could not look after himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This allowance will not be paid to the main income earner; it will be paid to the carer. The dependent spouse rebate will now be called the parent allowance. It will still go to those families where there are no dependent children. So the scaremongering about getting rid of the spouse rebate and only giving it to people who have kids at home is also a furphy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The child home care allowance both extends the benefit to those families who do not earn sufficient income to benefit from the dependent spouse rebate and places the cash directly in the hands of the person who is doing the work of caring for the children. This makes changes of policy significance in three main areas. First of all, the payment is not linked to gender or family formation. The payment is made to the person who actually cares for the child, whether male or female, parent or step parent, married or de facto. This means that the government is withdrawing from telling families how to arrange their lives. Families are free to make whatever arrangements suit them best. The government will support them in their child rearing work without judging or rewarding one way rather than another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the payment recognises that caring is real work. The honourable member for Paterson alluded to that earlier. For many years people who cared for an elderly or disabled relative or for children laboured under many of the isolating and self-esteem reducing assumptions that theirs was not a real job. To be just a housewife&mdash;and how many times have we heard that?&mdash;appeared to suggest that work was not involved. In fact, caring work is a substantial and real contribution to both our social and economic life. Even the hardest economic rationalists have to admit that, without nurturing work, nobody would live long enough to purchase products or to join the paid work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the payment is individually paid and means tested. In many families, the partners happily share their financial resources and it probably would not matter who received the payment or whose income was tested. But some families require special protection and care because of a partner being afflicted in their capacity for financial responsibility, for example, by addiction to drugs or alcohol, gambling or simply poor budgeting skills. For these people the separate payment to the carer represents a significant form of support which both increases the carer's financial bargaining power within the household and provides a safety net for financial crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Means testing only the carer and not the household as a unit is a step towards recognising the importance of the individual's contribution to the participation in the community. Professor Bettina Cass, of the department of social work and social policy&mdash;I have `of the university' here; I am not sure which university&mdash;speaking at a recent social security policy: the future conference in Canberra, commented on the way in which the home child-care allowance is a part of a process of adapting the social security system to meet changing expectations and labour force participation patterns in Australia in the 1990s. In particular, she noted with approval the recognition of the social and economic value of caring work. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . based on the individual as the unit of assessment, would be built on the clear societal understanding that these recognised forms of social participation and contribution to the economic and social welfare of the community will provide eligibility for income support, provide it equitably and provide it so as to enhance dignity and support participation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like previous speakers, I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate on the Social Security (Home Child-care and Partner Allowances) Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. With 14 speakers listed, it shows the importance that many of us place on this bill. As previous speakers have stated, it is quite appropriate that we are debating this bill in 1994, the International Year of the Family. The home child-care allowance is a major initiative, one of the many in last year's budget, which delivers the government's election promises to the families and, more especially, to the women of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Policies for women are integral to the federal government's economic and social strategies. The government's 1993 election commitments recognised women's work and skills as essential to future growth in the Australian economy improvements, to improvements in living standards and to a fair share of the benefits of economic growth. It also acknowledged the important role the government plays in supporting women's choices about their lives. For the first time, the contribution of women caring for children at home was given the importance it deserves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is rather ironic and, I think, typical of the current opposition, having listened to some of the speakers prior to dinner, that when it comes to so many reforms or almost anything resembling progressive change, we have trotted out the shrieks of alarm and the cliches which cast aspersions on what we are about to do. I was somewhat amazed to listen to the comments of several of the opposition speakers, especially the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock). During his speech on the bill he trotted out emotive cliches. He mentioned `the old-fashioned pea and thimble trick'. He said that the government is `ripping back the benefits from taxpayers', and that this is `a sneaky way' to get things done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) took up the challenge and outdid the honourable member for Berowra. We heard a word which I have never heard before, but which I suppose will go down in the annals now it is in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;`feminazis', who have `taken over' and `thrown out the family culture'. Senator Crowley is the `minister for family disservices'. He said, `This is all about social engineering' and `The government is anti-family'. One wonders why the opposition did not trot out the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter). I would love to hear his views on this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I go on to talk about some of the aspects of this bill I think it is vital that I correct some of the false impressions that are being promoted in the media. The honourable member for McPherson alluded to the government's so-called `social engineering'. One remembers the totally false and destructive campaign that the opposition and many of its followers undertook regarding the new guidelines for child-care centres just before Christmas, informing parents that children were no longer allowed to sing carols, that boys were not going to be allowed to play with trucks and girls not allowed to play with dolls&mdash;outrageous, mischievous and totally false claims that had parents worrying needlessly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there was the hysterical campaign that started up concerning child-care accreditation. It was interesting to read today in my local newspaper, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS>, of claims by the leader of the National Party in the Senate, Senator Boswell, that the accreditation scheme will add up to $69 per week to the cost of caring for a single child&mdash;once again, scaremongering. It was interesting to note that this was supported by the executive member of the Association of Child Care Centres of New South Wales, Marion Parker, who claims that the regulations would be `far in excess' of the government's estimated 88c a day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Staff in my office today have been in contact with representatives of the child-care industry in my electorate about the new accreditation scheme. It appears that the major complaint that child-care centres have about the new accreditation scheme is that, just as they had to do prior to Christmas, their workers once again must spend their valuable time assuring parents that the accreditation scheme is a very positive reform. The accreditation scheme is welcomed. It is interesting to note that in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Examiner</EMPHASIS>&mdash;I do not know what we do in Tasmania but we certainly do it better than anywhere else in Australia&mdash;it is reported that in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland fees will rise by between $18 and $69 a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But Launceston child-care centres have moved to allay fears that such a rise could occur in Tasmania. The Director of the Bungawitta Child Care Centre said that the accreditation scheme was terrific and well overdue. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only way it can put costs up is if quality care is not being provided . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will only force up costs for those centres that are cutting corners and they have no right to do that when they are looking after children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one should be providing sub-standard care . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The Director of the Dame Marjorie Parker Creche, which is also in Launceston, said that the accreditation scheme was a positive step which provided security for parents. She said, `We have been fighting for it for some time'. The Director of the Pedder Patter Child Care Centre said the accreditation scheme was the best thing to happen to child care. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be seen as a positive step for families to know their children will be cared for in a quality environment . . .</PARA>
<PARA>She said that only those centres with substandard services would face additional costs as a result of the scheme.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This accreditation scheme does provide the opportunity for industry to set standards to include parents in that process and to continue to develop the industry's very professional image. I suggest that the privately owned child-care centres have been aggressively lobbying those on the other side of the House and that there has been a massive knee-jerk reaction to that lobbying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask honourable members on the other side to reflect on those unfounded remarks about child-care centres which were made before Christmas and mentioned here again tonight and also the current comments about the accreditation scheme and the hoary chestnuts that were raised by the opposition members in the debate. Those comments have caused needless concern for parents and have created unnecessary stress and worry for child-care workers and the rest of our community. Honourable members opposite go on about the fact that they care for the family. If there are genuine concerns from honourable members on the other side about this bill, let us debate it properly rather than use the emotive language which I previously mentioned was used by those on the other side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill has by its very name two distinct parts, yet they are linked by a common social justice thread&mdash;that of enabling families and especially the care givers to provide their families with additional resources in order to improve their quality of life. Most honourable members have mentioned the fact that 840,000 families across the length and breadth of Australia are expected to receive this home child-care allowance at any one time. As I have already stated, it directly recognises the contribution made by carers of children, who are usually the mothers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The maximum rate of the allowance will be $1,560 per annum, which translates more understandably to people in my electorate to $60 a fortnight. The rate will be subject to an income test based on the income of the person receiving the allowance. As several honourable members have mentioned, the rate of the allowance will be reduced at the rate of 25c for every dollar over and above $282 per annum, and will phase out when income exceeds $250.85 per fortnight. So, as previous speakers have mentioned, it does allow the care giver to seek additional work, which will perhaps provide them with the opportunity to enter part-time or full-time work once their children are past the age of being cared for at home and enter the school system. It is also important to note that any income of the person's partner will not be taken into account and the allowance will not be subject to an assets test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is pleasing to note that the home child-care allowance will be paid until the end of the calendar year in which a dependent child, generally the youngest, turns 18 or until the child ceases secondary schooling&mdash;whichever happens first. This generosity stands in stark contrast to the opposition's Fightback proposals which it hawked around the country less than 12 months ago and which suggested that the opposition was going to eliminate family payments once the child reached the age of 12. This allowance, as previous speakers have also mentioned, will allow approximately 55,000 families whose tax liabilities were previously too low to get the full value of the existing dependent spouse rebate to now receive greater assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the home child-care allowance and the partner allowance build on previous government reforms to pay family payments directly to the carers of children. In contrast, the coalition is exploring income splitting options which would, I think, be regressive&mdash;providing most benefit, as is usual, to high income families&mdash;and would not provide a direct cash payment to the carer of children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to briefly speak on the partner allowance, to which somewhat radical changes are being made. As a former electorate officer, I think that some people will be wandering into our offices seeking clarification about what is happening with the partner allowance. The additional amount of allowance for a dependent partner previously paid to recipients of jobsearch, newstart and sickness allowances will now be paid directly to the dependent partner as a partner allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my fervent hope that, prior to September when this measure is introduced, the minister will ensure that there is widespread advertising about the need for partners to lodge a separate claim for partner allowance. Also, because jobstart, newstart and sickness allowance beneficiaries and their spouses usually hold joint bank accounts, partners may wish to open a new account to receive their partner allowance. Reminders should also be given about the requirements banks have regarding identification and the hassles that this might cause people receiving this new allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initiatives generated by this bill are properly focused towards the many Australian families who need them. I am therefore proud to be associated with the bill and I commend it most sincerely to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise to support the Social Security (Home Child Care and Partner Allowance) Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. If my speech is not as organised as it should be, that could be a reflection of the fact that I have just learned of the death of Matt Gure, a friend of mine from my part of the world. I would like to take this opportunity to thank him for his contribution to society and for the commitment that he showed over many years in his job as a public servant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Child care is a family issue, and is therefore a Labor Party issue. At the last election I was happy to stand on the Labor Party's record against the coalition's basket of woe. For the benefit of those coalition members who are here, I draw their attention to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 6 September 1992, describing the proposed tax system outlined by the coalition before the last federal election. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A tax system which fails to recognise the obligations of marriage and the family must be described as a system of de facto fiscal discrimination against families. </PARA>
<PARA>That is where the opposition is coming from, so it should not be criticising the Labor Party for what it has done. Further, the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission had this to say about the Liberal Party's basket of woes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From the point of view of its effect on the poor and families&mdash;the person and the meaning of family life&mdash;one must question the moral legitimacy of the GST.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Catholic Social Welfare Commission questioned the opposition's moral legitimacy. Yet opposition members still come in here and talk about standing up for family values. They feign concern for the poor and for families, but when they left office only 46,000 child-care places existed&mdash;and, according to my records, those places had been initiated by the Whitlam government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition members do not care about child care. They never have and their record proves it. The opposition's record proves that it has done absolutely nothing to assure Australian working families that their children are safe and will be well cared for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this issue opposition members should do the decent thing and sit down and shut up because it is clear from the policy announced at the last election that their party has nothing to say. In fact, it has a long record of having nothing to say. Meanwhile, the government's record on child care has been exemplary. We have increased the number of child care places from 46,000 to over 208,000 in 10 years. Opposition members cannot deny that because those are the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to hear some of the comments made by the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) during the debate. To some extent, I was a little outraged by the way in which he made some of his comments. He said, `Let me make it clear, I am not trying to denigrate anyone who is in a broken family or a single income family. I am not trying to denigrate those people in the child-care industry'. In the context in which the honourable member was saying this, he was indeed denigrating people in broken families, the children of those broken families and the people who work in the child-care industry. That is exactly what he was doing, but he did not want to take the load for that. He did not have the intestinal fortitude to say, `Yes, I look down upon you'. No, he wanted to make sure that the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) did not come in and take his heart out&mdash;if indeed he has one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very proud to have heard the comments made by the honourable member for Forde from our side of the House. It was one of the better speeches that I have heard. Those on the other side of this House do not realise, have not realised and will never realise, whether they like it or not, that this Australian society is going through a process of reorganisation. We do not live in a static world but a dynamic world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am married to a person who was born overseas and who was eight when her family came to this country. It is  interesting to listen to some of her relatives who seem to think that the old country that they came from all of a sudden stopped when they left, that it is in some sort of tomb and that all will be exactly the same when they go back. The world is not like that&mdash;and thank God it is not. The challenge to the men and women of Australia today&mdash;a comment that Gough Whitlam would have made; that is essentially where it started, as you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would know&mdash;and the response they have to make to the reorganisation of this society is inequality. He talked about people, irrespective of their genitalia, being able to stand up in a world where they could go forward and use the gifts that had been bestowed on them in the most appropriate way for the service of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of us, particularly those in my age group&mdash;perhaps those younger than I do not even know about it&mdash;forget that up until 1966 it was against the law for married women to have jobs. To the credit of the then Liberal government, it threw that provision out by repealing that law. I urge honourable members to think about the fact that until 1966 when a woman got married she had to leave her job. There were so many women in Australian society who lived lies, who went to work secretly married and whispered about their husbands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad that this society is changing and that men and women have to face the challenges in front of them. It is not easy for women and it is not easy for men, because a new world order demands that we have to be introspective. We have to look at those things which have been cast upon us by the society around us&mdash;the prejudices and the things that we do not even realise that we know or that we have learnt. We have to examine those things and be self-critical. I know that is a very difficult thing in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for McPherson gave us a whole range of statistics about broken marriages and told us how the children of those broken marriages were somewhat tarnished. I suppose he was implying that child care was the cause of broken marriages. That is the only thing I could see about the relevance of what he was saying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put to the honourable member that broken marriages are all about broken relationships; they are all about people growing apart. Thank God we had Lionel Murphy. Thank God we had a man who stood up and said, `The charade that we have played in this country for years that you have to go out and get some pimp and pervert to take photos of your partner doing whatever in the back of a mini or wherever should be thrown out'. Thank God he tried to bring some form of justice and sense into the divorce laws of this country, because the honourable member for McPherson was implying that the old system was good, that people lived for 40 years in a state of war for the sake of the children and that abuse should have been handled quietly by saying, `Don't tell anyone'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Mr Deputy Speaker, you know what I am talking about. You have lived in that Australia. Violence was swept under the carpet. In some of our ethnic groups&mdash;and I will not name any in particular&mdash;it is still a problem. People think they have a property right over another person and a right to inflict violence. As a teacher, I can say that when I first went out into that profession teachers were still caning children to make sure that they learned. There was corporal punishment to make people do the right thing. I refused to have anything to do with it. It took me a lot longer to learn the methodology of not having to beat people, but I felt a lot better about it as a teacher. I did make the effort to try to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So much depression came out of the old system of marriage where people stuck together for the sake of the children and because of what the neighbours would think. There were illegal abortions. The honourable member for McPherson has implied that these things were good. He put the ridiculous proposition&mdash;and I hope people heard it&mdash;that child care might cause all this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently read a book called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships to Shore</EMPHASIS>. It is a story about the Melbourne waterfront and the fights that took place there between the working class and the upper crust of Victoria&mdash;the aristocracy and the squattocracy. The honourable member for Forde was right. Poor and working class families have always had all their members working to put food on the table, shoes on their kids' feet, clothes on their backs and a roof over their heads. I appreciate the fact that the honourable member for Forde tried to remind those opposite of that. The situation is no different now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of hypocrisy goes down in this place, including the idea that child care was somehow going to take parenting away. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, would probably have noted one or two such ideas in your period in the House. The honourable member for McPherson is implying that private boarding schools should be banned. He wants to close all the private boarding schools because they are not parented&mdash;the parents are elsewhere. But not too many children of working class families went to private boarding schools. If he is suggesting that, a lot of people in the bush would be quite upset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our society has to reorganise. Men and women of Australia have to meet the challenge. And the challenge is for equal opportunity. It is not a matter of birth or genitalia or whether we have ability with our brains or other abilities. Intellectual capacity is not the only thing in society. Sometimes I have found that people who do not have a lot intellectually have been world beaters, because they have things called compassion and heart. I would suggest to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that those things have nothing to do with a person's sex; they have a lot to do with a person's soul and spirit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear rantings and ravings&mdash;and I have heard some of the most outrageous statements from the other side&mdash;about efficiencies and using our resources to the best of our ability. For God's sake, half the population of this country has been held out of positions in boardrooms and in this place&mdash;and my party has been guilty of it too. They have not been able to gain those positions&mdash;not through lack of ability, not through lack of assertiveness, not through lack of confidence, not through being unable to do the job, but because, in a world that is unequal and unfair, their genitalia got in the way. I do not mean physically, of course, but in fact they were seen as women&mdash;and we cannot have women in the boys' clubs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that this equality has nothing to do with the breakdowns in marriage. I suggest that, if anything, the breakdowns in marriage have come from a lack of equality. I am guilty of this as much as anyone else. As individuals, we sometimes get caught up in our own self-importance. We get caught up with where we are going and do not talk; we do not express ourselves to the people who mean the most to us. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am learning, and I can tell you that it is hard. There are years of prejudice that have been ingrained. I have tried specifically to fight it, but I still find it coming out. It is embarrassing sometimes when it comes out because I do not even know it is there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This challenge to create equality may not seem to have a lot to do with the bill before us, but it has everything to do with it. This is not a women's issue; this is a family issue. In years past I took exception to having my language corrected. Some of my fellow human beings took exception to words I used&mdash;words like `lady' and others. At the time I found it somewhat annoying. But, really, we do have to address the way that we look at issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to all honourable members in this House, child care is not a women's issue; it is a family issue. In terms of my family life, I am desperately trying to do a rotten job. I love my job but, in terms of having a family, it is a rotten job&mdash;it takes us away. But I am desperately trying to do my best to contribute to my family in the biggest way that I possibly can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Lowe (Ms Easson) who, in her first speech&mdash;and I emphasise that; her first speech&mdash;in this House referred to the creche needed in this place; she is doing me a very great service.

I don't want you to go to work', to which I was replying, `I've got to, son; I've just got to'. I would have liked to have been able to have him here. My wife will be going back to her profession and holding down a career. Why should she not have a career? Why should she not be able to contribute?

Not all parents who send their children to boarding school take that attitude, but there have probably been a few. I hope that this legislation results in a reorganisation of society.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very happy to be speaking in this debate. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), on behalf of the Labor Party, gave an undertaking to the families of Australia prior to March 1993. That undertaking, which was to introduce a new allowance for home child care, has been prepared and is now being enacted in this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This allowance, which will be available from 29 September 1994, will replace the dependent spouse rebate currently available through the taxation system to couples with dependent children. The allowance will not be taxed; it will be for a maximum of $1,500 per annum; it will be indexed annually; and it will be subject to an income test based on the dependent partner's income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This new allowance is welcomed by a great many women who remain in the home and whose main occupation&mdash;a very noble one&mdash;is full-time homemaking. Over the past generation, a great many married women with children have joined the paid work force&mdash;I am one of them&mdash;and I support a woman's right to do so if that is her decision. However, it is also true that many married women with children are in the paid work force not by choice but by necessity. The pressure of finance, mortgage payments and the cost of raising children have often forced women to leave their home and children to seek paid work outside the home. I do not think that a healthy society grows when the overriding ethos is an economic one. I have said often that Australia is primarily a society. Paid work is not the soul of our society. Our work is what we do, not what we are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many married women with children, given a real choice, would opt out of the paid work force and happily stay in the home. This is not universally true, but it is substantially true. It is especially true for women with young children. Obviously, as the youngest child grows older the need for the mother to be in the home full time can decline. This allowance is a very useful contribution to families having a choice in this field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that a lot of the problems and difficulties concerning working women with children still exist. It is therefore most important for this parliament&mdash;90 per cent male&mdash;to acknowledge the existence of these problems and difficulties. The solutions to these problems and difficulties are related to our economic development. Economically, we are still burdened by high unemployment, a persistent current account deficit and an aging population. A national policy of alleviating the effects of these three problems would require us to be a richer country than we currently are. A richer nation would extend the choices of working women with children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly pleased to see that this allowance will be paid directly to the person doing the work of child care. Previously, the dependent spouse rebate operated through the tax return of, generally, the husband. I am very pleased to see that this allowance will be paid to many thousands of people below the tax threshold. The dependent spouse rebate was only available to taxpayers. These benefits, through the new allowance, will now be more widely available. This is equitable and more in keeping with our Australian way of doing things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A more contemporary and equitable approach is recognised in this legislation, and the carer of the children, generally the wife, is the direct beneficiary of this allowance. I notice that proposed new section 907 says that a person will continue to receive the allowance even after being out of Australia for up to 13 weeks. I approve of this section. In today's world of jet travel, it is easy for parents and children to suddenly leave Australia to go to the side of an ill relative in another country. We are a nation of migrants, and many Australian children have one or both sets of grandparents overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the department to make a special effort to bring section 907 to the attention of allowance receivers. The department has a similar rule for other social security recipients and my office has dealt with people who have inadvertently fallen foul of a rule similar to proposed new section 907. This inadvertence was due to widespread lack of knowledge of the rule. I urge the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) to ensure that his department, which is already run highly efficiently, takes steps to advertise any social security rule that cuts off social security payments when recipients go overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed new section 771HA concerns qualifications for partner allowance. The section is well thought out and a model of clarity. However, real life can never be reduced to the framework of any group of public servants. It is certain that there will be situations in the future not covered by the new section 771HA. Therefore, it would be beneficial if this bill were to give latitude and discretion to the department's secretary and delegates of the secretary in the determination of qualifications for this allowance. We pay senior public servants well. They are well educated and conscientious, and I think this parliament can trust them with discretionary powers to be used in a positive manner in favour of a borderline applicant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further situation which qualifies for discretionary powers is proposed new section 771HF. This section deals with the assets test and an allowance not payable if the assets value limit is exceeded. We are fortunately now out of recession and advancing towards a better economic situation. In the years ahead we are likely to see property booms, stock exchange booms and all the other commonplaces of Australia during economic good times. This will make the determination of the value of assets quite problematic. Unless discretion is available to senior departmental officers to be used positively for the benefit of an applicant, we will see a great amount of departmental effort taken up in argumentation over aspects of proposed new section 771HF. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the department on its sensitivity concerning the possible death and bereavement of a child, which, of course, brings to an end an allowance for home child care. Such sensitivity is definitely consistent with the general approach of honourable members of this House. </PARA>

They certainly do not have anything as forthright in direction as this and many of them were very envious of the sorts of policies that we have in this regard. I think it is often salient for us to realise how progressive many of our policies are and to take great pride in them in this country. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to take this opportunity to speak in support of the Social Security (Home Child Care and Partner Allowances) Legislation Amendment Bill, which introduces the home child-care allowance and the partner allowance. The home child-care allowance gives effect to a commitment announced by the Labor government prior to the 1993 election. Both the home child-care allowance and the partner allowance build on previous government reforms to pay family payments directly to carers of children, usually women, and they are totally consistent with the Labor Party's commitment to social justice. In contrast, the coalition is exploring income splitting options, which would be regressive in most cases, providing most benefit to high income families, and would not provide a direct cash benefit to the carers of children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently under the taxation system a dependent spouse rebate for couples with dependent children is provided in recognition of the fact that the cost of supporting dependants reduces a person's capacity to pay tax in comparison with a person who does not have dependants. That rebate will be replaced by the home child-care allowance, which will be paid directly to the dependent partner.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Approximately 55,000 families whose tax liability was previously too low to get the full value of the existing dependent spouse rebate for couples with dependent children will receive greater assistance from the new allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The home child-care allowance will be introduced on 29 September 1994 and, as I said, it will be paid fortnightly through the social security system. As I also said, it will be paid directly to the dependent partner of a couple with a dependent child or children. That is a very significant part of this bill. The maximum rate of the allowance will be $60 a fortnight, approximately $6 a fortnight higher than the current maximum rate of dependent spouse rebate for families with children. The allowance will be subject to an income test based on the income of only the dependent partner and will not be subject to an assets test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is also introducing a partner allowance payable to dependent partners of recipients of the jobsearch allowance, newstart allowance or sickness allowance. This replaces the current situation where the additional amount is paid directly to the recipient of those allowances. The total amount involved will be the same but will now be split into two separate payments, one to each partner. This will apply from 20 September 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments underline the Labor government's commitment to child-care programs and to support for families with children. As a parent myself with a dependent spouse and young family, like a great many of my constituents in Macarthur, I understand the importance of these programs in the context of social justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Macarthur electorate, south-west of Sydney, is one of the fastest growing regions. It has one of the youngest populations in Australia, with about half the population in the area under the age of 20. Unfortunately, many of the benefits of the significant commitment by this government to children's services programs in recent years have been denied to the people of Macarthur and to the people of New South Wales. This is because the New South Wales coalition government has deliberately obstructed and refused to sign the Commonwealth-state agreement in what has been a joint Commonwealth-state program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) mentioned earlier in the debate, 780 occasional child-care places funded by the Commonwealth in the 1988 budget have yet to be actually delivered, and at least 600 of these are in New South Wales. This disgraceful situation affects not only occasional child care but also other forms of child care, such as long day care and out of school hours care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the New South Wales Liberal-National government of John Fahey continues to play grubby politics with a Commonwealth-state program, the young families of New South Wales, including the areas of rapid growth and high need for children's services, such as Macarthur, continue to miss out. This situation has led to the federal government now deciding to fund many of these programs directly to local government, as was foreshadowed before the last election and announced by the Minister for Family Services, Senator Crowley, last month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The home child-care allowance is a major initiative in what is the International Year of the Family. We have heard a lot in this debate already about the International Year of the Family and much of it has been hypocrisy in the case of the opposition. Between Christmas and New Year I was on holidays with my family and I could not help but notice in the newspapers that around about 30 and 31 December a number of opposition members were falling over each other to get into the papers to strut their stuff about the International Year of the Family. It is almost as though they had just discovered that 1994 was going to be the International Year of the Family and they wanted to try to use it to make some political point. The opposition obviously has not got any other issues to run with so it thought it would invent something under that particular banner. It ran with the issue of income splitting and the proposal to look at the tax system. It was rather strange to see all of this in the papers. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) were all hopping into the newspapers trying to get some reflective glory in the International Year of the Family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party was not quite so enthusiastic a year ago when it was the International Year of the World's Indigenous People. We did not hear much about that from the opposition. Those opposite took a rather different attitude towards the International Year of the World's Indigenous People. It was pretty clear from the Liberal Party's response to the Mabo decision and its disgraceful and obstructionist attitude towards the Native Title Bill that it was not very enthusiastic at all about the International Year of the World's Indigenous People. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that it is the International Year of the Family the opposition is suddenly jumping out of the woodwork and trying to gain some political mileage. If we listen to some of the rhetoric that we have heard in this debate today and some of the public statements that have been made, it would appear that the opposition thinks it has a monopoly on the family. It is almost as though the opposition thinks that people who vote Labor do not have families. We are told a lot about what sort of family we should have and what the appropriate family unit should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everybody is born with parents and most people enjoy a family life of one sort or another. It is up to an individual to choose exactly what form that family takes. The opposition has missed the boat because it is the Labor government that has taken the initiative on the International Year of the Family. The government has introduced this legislation. I happen to know that for some years several departments&mdash;and particularly the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services&mdash;have been planning for this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has developed lots of initiatives on work based child care to encourage employers to provide work sponsored child care for employees. The expansion of the children services program has been tantamount evidence of this government's commitment to child care and the recognition of the importance of families in the International Year of the Family. Once again the opposition is trying to make some cheap political mileage and moralistic mileage out of the International Year of the Family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the Labor government that has taken the initiative in this regard. It is the government that is doing the big things with child care and bringing in the reforms. It took the opposition 10 years to recognise that child care was an important issue in the community. In December 1992 the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) finally realised that Fightback 1 was not a goer and he had to change it a bit and bring in Fightback 2. That was when he recognised that child care was a bit important and he decided to do something about having a policy on child care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a bit late because the Labor government had already been promoting child care, funding child care and recognising the importance of child care to both working parents and families where only one partner worked. The government has recognised the importance of child care as a social justice issue for a long time now. As with most major social reform in this country, the opposition is a long way behind and it will remain a long way behind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend this bill to the House. It is yet another reform that the government promised in its election campaign and which it is delivering.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it extremely pleasurable to be able to start the new year following the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland) on the Social Security (Home Child Care and Partner Allowances) Legislation Amendment Bill. In particular I support his final remarks regarding the delivery of the commitments made in March of last year. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said at question time today, some people find it difficult to accept that this government has been so consistent and so positive. That we have been progressing, step by step, the agenda put forward in the election from March right through till now, and we are still going, I think is fairly significant. It might be a bit hard for the opposition and some in the community who would rather demean that achievement to accept that. But the reality is that we as a government will persist and persevere. Those people who supported us in March 1993 on the basis of our platform and policies will be more than justified with their confidence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has always been poor practice to use tax rebates as a means of family support and recognition of dependent children and spouses. Turning that spouse rebate into an allowance, as this legislation does, will be a major step forward. In many ways it is coherent and fits very well with the range of actions of this government over the last 11 years. Looking at child allowances and family support&mdash;the whole raft of changes and initiatives that have been undertaken in that period&mdash;is just one more step in trying to focus on supporting, in ways which are appropriate, those in the community who need support. This is an extremely appropriate way. </PARA>

I join with my colleagues in speaking in this debate and in adding our personal stamps and voices to it to indicate to all in the community that this government is not just coherent and far-sighted but also very strong and united in approaching issues that affect and support families. In this current year, that is more than appropriate. I very strongly commend the bill, which focuses on improving the conditions of families in the community, to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank all the honourable members, particularly from this side of the House, who have contributed to the debate. I listened with some interest to the contribution by the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock). Although I was not able to be in the House, I watched him on closed-circuit television. I must admit that what he had to say was no different from what he usually has to say in matters relating to the welfare of Australians, particularly families and those who need the social security system as some sort of a safety net and means of obtaining income, especially those who are on very low incomes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the parliamentary secretary in this House with responsibility for legislation in the social security area, I am very proud to have been involved in introducing and debating a number of measures in this portfolio over the last four years which, all in all, has been to the betterment of Australians generally and particularly to those who need our assistance. I will not take too much of the House's time, but I want to make a few comments on some of the contributions that were made, particularly by the honourable member for Berowra, who has come into the House. I apologise to the House for not being here in person when the honourable member made his contribution. I was here in spirit and listening to his contribution upstairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Berowra has made the claim tonight that income for most families will not change&mdash;that what we are doing here today is a revenue neutral exercise. When this measure is fully implemented there will be a cost to government of some $200 million more each year than the cost of the existing dependent spouse rebate. This is due to a number of factors. Firstly, there is an increase of nearly $6 per fortnight in the maximum payment, which means that nearly 800,000 families will benefit from this higher rate. In addition to that, we are paying up to $60 per fortnight to an additional 55,000 families whose tax liabilities were too low to get the full value of the dependent spouse rebate. Fifty-five thousand families who were getting nothing out of the dependent spouse rebate will now be covered by this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This measure is much more responsive to family needs because it bases payment on the current income of the carer. That will assist up to 120,000 families a year. For example, if a woman leaves the work force to have a baby, she will be able to claim home child-care allowance straight away rather than having to wait until the new financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These policies and measures contrast with some of the known stances taken by my colleagues in the opposition. The honourable member for Berowra claimed that the government did not have a coherent or sensible family policy. He said that different payments were delivered by different agencies&mdash;for example, that the child-care rebate was paid by Medicare offices. The reality is that the coalition has no family support policies; it is simply arguing about income splitting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland) said that during the silly season a number of opposition members were involved in making those sorts of statements. I do not see how splitting incomes will be of any great benefit to children. There is no doubt that such a measure would be highly regressive and hugely expensive, without delivering any direct assistance to the partner at home caring for the children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One absolutely unbelievable act of hypocrisy came to my attention during the silly season when I happened to be listening to a report on ABC radio. I heard Senator Jocelyn Newman, if I remember correctly, saying all sorts of things about what the coalition would do for families. She had the  audacity, as had the honourable member for Berowra, to criticise the government for lowering the income test for the basic family payment from $65,000 to $60,000. What the coalition did not say&mdash;this is the hypocrisy of it&mdash;was that under Fightback the opposition intended to knock that figure down to $55,000, which would have had the effect of cutting off twice as many families from the basic family payment system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of coalition members&mdash;including, I think, the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford)&mdash;claimed that every bit of government policy was anti-family. I acknowledge that the views held by the honourable member for McPherson are very sincere. I know that when he says something, particularly when it is about families, that it is said quite sincerely. Nevertheless, the attitude of those opposite, including the honourable member for McPherson, is a little bit rich. Their attitude ignores a number of things. In particular, it ignores this government's record of achievement in supporting families by initiatives such as Medicare and child care, and through direct payments, such as additional family payments for families dependent on social security and low income working families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Families with two small children and which are renting privately now receive up to $123 per week in tax-free family payments. In real terms, that is worth more than five times the assistance that was paid at the time of our election to government in 1983. On top of that, many of these low income working families will soon get the HCCA. As an indication of just how much this government spends on families, in the 1993-94 budget some $5 billion was allowed for in family payments alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Berowra also complained about changing the maximum qualifying age of 25 under the dependent spouse rebate provisions to 18 under the new home child-care allowance provisions. Families without children can still claim the dependent spouse rebate, so the net loss is small. The government has decided to pay the HCCA on conditions as close as possible to those for the family payments, for which 18 is the maximum qualifying age. Therefore, very few families are affected by this and, in any event, it is offset to some extent by the home child-care allowance having a higher child income test than the dependent spouse rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some younger children with part-time jobs whose families would have missed out on the dependent spouse rebate will now get the HCCA. The HCCA is not payable if the family is overseas for more than 13 weeks or if the claim is made outside of Australia. However, such families can still claim the dependent spouse rebate without a child, so the net loss is very small.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that the honourable member for Berowra issued a press release today which states all the things that he has said in the House. The fact is that he finds it difficult to acknowledge that we are doing the right thing. Since he became the shadow spokesman on social security matters at the time of the last election, I have seen him stand up in this place and absolutely deride every good measure that we have introduced in this House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition will not oppose the amendment. I make the point, as I did in relation to the debate, that the necessity for an amendment of this sort demonstrates the shortcomings in legislation of this complexity and detail. I think the Social Security (Home Child Care and Partner Allowances) Legislation Amendment Bill requires very considerable examination because of its impact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier in the debate I took the opportunity of highlighting a number of matters which were of concern to me. They have not been fully addressed by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) in his contribution to this debate. As I am sure is well understood by you, Mr Nehl, and many of your colleagues, obviously the fact that an allowance such as the remote area allowance, to which a great deal of importance is attached, was to be included in the assessment of income demonstrates the shortcoming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relationship between my office and the offices of the parliamentary secretary and the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) is not altogether that distant that we were not asking for details of these matters, and we were informed in advance that an amendment was intended. A bill of this sort ought to be the subject of a much more comprehensive examination by this parliament than the rather cursory examination that occurs in a debate of this sort. I am disappointed that it will be up to the Senate to undertake that examination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary secretary will see that I do compliment some of his colleagues. The honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) emphasised last evening the importance of committees of this House being involved in scrutiny of complex and detailed legislation. I was particularly impressed by the way he was able to advert how he circulates government legislation amongst his former colleagues in our profession for comment, advice and counsel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government were prepared at this stage to accept that an inquiry be undertaken by a committee of this parliament, I would be happy to accede to that suggestion. If the government is not prepared to respond in that way, the opposition will seek to have the matter referred to a Senate committee to enable that comprehensive review to take place. My examination of the differences between this legislation and the Income Tax Assessment Act in relation to the way in which tests are applied in qualifying for these allowances as against the old dependent spouse rebate, revealed an enormous number of implications for the way in which this new scheme will operate, which the parliament ought to have cognisance of when it is looking at the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary secretary gave an explanation in relation to the issue of people living outside Australia. I appreciate the explanation and the fact that eligibility for a dependent spouse rebate might still apply. But it is a fact that eligibility for the dependent spouse rebate will still apply to, say, an Australian soldier serving in Butterworth, or Australian troops serving in Australia's interests in a peacekeeping force, or an Australian diplomat, or even to officers of the Department of Social Security who are placed in some overseas posts and who may be, for a time, with their families. The dependent spouse rebate that they would be eligible for would be at a lower rate than the full rate&mdash;with dependants, I assume&mdash;so the benefit they would receive would be lower.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regard that as an anomaly. I suspect it has not been addressed.

To this end, the government, with its usual fairy-like lightness of touch, brought in what was essentially a new tax on business to force companies to meet a fairly arbitrary level of training for their employees. At first, this meant that only companies with a payroll of $200,000 or more were required to pay the levy. Later the payroll was raised to $220,000. The levy began at one per cent of annual national payroll and has risen to 1.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point about the levy is that it simply does not cover the majority of Australian businesses which are too small to fall within the net. In fact, 93 per cent of businesses are excluded from the requirements of this legislation due to insufficient payroll. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is that the rest were, in most cases, already spending the money on training. The big companies were spending at least two to three per cent on training. For example, companies such as IBM spend as much as 10 per cent of their annual payrolls on intensive staff training. Research by the Australian Taxation Office found that 63 per cent of businesses believed that they were spending the same or less on training since the levy was introduced. For some, the levy was a positive inducement to spend less on training of their staff because it put a specific figure beyond which the businesses were already spending on training and therefore managers decided that they were training in excess of what is normal and could introduce some useful cost cutting into the training area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A study by Professor Charles Noble of Charles Sturt University which looked at the impact of the levy on businesses in the Albury-Wodonga area found that 81 per cent of firms surveyed said that if the levy was abolished there would be no impact on the amount of training they were conducting. In the report one employer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The training levy is just one more wank in the overgrown undergrowth [of bureaucracy] and no worse than some of the others, but taken together they are as forbidding as a sea of blackberries.</PARA>
<PARA>What the Australian Taxation Office found, and various other reports have corroborated, is that 70 per cent of firms believe that the levy has resulted in more administrative work for their businesses. The levy is just another roll of red tape with which to strangle business in Australia. This may not be as crucial to large businesses but, for small to medium sized businesses which exist on a knife edge and have particularly done so in the last two or three years, it is not merely a manifest waste of resources, but often another nail in the coffin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the truly telling point is that not one study has had a good word for the training guarantee levy. The best that has been said about it is that it has made businesses focus on training. As the ones that do focus did so anyway, this is not really much of a point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Vocational Education, Employment Training Advisory Committee pointed out what should have been obvious about this scheme from the start. No money is being spent to assess what impact the changes in training are having. Therefore, there is absolutely no way of knowing whether any goal has been achieved, let alone whether that is the right goal. Twenty-eight per cent of the money spent on education in Australia is spent on vocational training, but only 15 per cent is spent on research. It is because there has been little scholarly research in the area that the Carmichael report got such an uncritical reception and the government has been able to go its own sweet way. Dean Ashendon produced a report for the National Board of Employment, Education and Training pointing out that there is no single body in this country responsible for national directions in skills formation and recognition. It is a gap to which we are looking to the Australian National Training Authority to fill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A study by Tim Henson, from Monash University's David Syme faculty of business, found that only four companies in 100 had anything positive to say about the training guarantee levy. The study looked at medium sized manufacturing firms in Victoria. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Respondents from all industry sectors stated that they are now simply documenting what was already done prior to the introduction of the act.</PARA>
<PARA>Thirty-four per cent of respondents considered the effectiveness of the training guarantee legislation in improving the skills of the Australian work force to be only minimally effective and over 60 per cent of the respondents indicated that the training levy was minimally to not at all effective in improving workplace skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Expenditure on training has increased over the period since the introduction of the legislation from 2.2 per cent of gross wages and salaries in the September quarter of 1989 to 2.6 per cent in the corresponding quarter of 1990. However, these figures are entirely rubbery because of the lack of record keeping before the introduction of the levy itself and so cannot be relied upon in any way. Training on average now consists of 3.6 hours of on-the-job training and 2.3 hours of external training at a cost of about $27.50 per hour to employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Society for Performance and Instruction has claimed that this expenditure is money not well spent. The society has cautioned that 80 per cent of trainers and human resource practitioners did not conduct proper evaluation of what training was needed in the organisation served and did not evaluate whether the training had any discernible effects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nub of the problem with such heavy-arm tactics for encouraging training is that all of the emphasis is placed on the delivery of the training itself rather than the actual content and the value of the training. This observation has been corroborated by the Job Watch organisation, which reported earlier in 1982 that much of the training provided to the unemployed hoping to reskill is inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From what I have been told by Social Security officers, the unemployed are put on a merry-go-round of mickey mouse, dead-end, short training courses and are no better off than before they started, but the public conscience of course has been salved because the money has been spent, albeit in many cases uselessly. This is, I suppose, what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) calls being jobs ready. There is no point in being jobs ready unless there are jobs, and the economic miracle we are now witnessing is not expected to do much for those who are already unemployed in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another taxation office report led to the damning admission that, on the basis of compliance in 1990-91, there was insufficient evidence available to conclude whether the legislation has led to any improvement in the quality of training or any increase in the amount and distribution of employer investment in employer related training. Less than 20 per cent of money spent went to external training programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation was aimed at stimulating training in small businesses, where it was most lacking, but here the levy has had the least effect. Businesses with payrolls between $220,000 and $500,000 a year accounted for 65 per cent of the eligible employer population and made up 77 per cent of those who voluntarily lodged shortfall statements and 75 per cent of those who did not meet their training obligations. This small business group, with the equivalent of eight to 20 employees, had the lowest estimated compliance rate at 94.1 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What should be pointed out about the compliance rates is that for the first year of the levy the standards set by the tax office were not particularly rigorous. The tax office concedes that if its assessments had been more rigorous the compliance rate would have been reduced to around 80 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Previously, the company had only to show that it spent the amount and made a genuine effort. Now it is required that the training program must be structured. This means that before the program begins, organisations have to identify the skills to be acquired by the participants in the training, the means of imparting those skills, expected outcomes and the extent to which the participants' productivity will be enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The requirement for structured training presents a particular dilemma for small to medium sized businesses. About 45,000 of them fall within the net of the levy. If the training is not structured, employers who have spent well in excess of 1.5 per cent of their payrolls on training find that they still have a liability to make a non-tax deductible payment to the Australian Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A study by Karen Beresford and Jim Gaite from the University of South Australia reported that small business managers agreed unanimously that staff training was helpful to a business but was not necessarily of a kind that could be claimed under the Training Guarantee Act. This is because much of the one-to-one unstructured training considered vital to a small business is a training cost but it is too difficult, or in many cases impossible, to claim under the training guarantee levy provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will use an example which may be a little sensitive to members opposite at present. How does one structure the training of a sandwich hand in a little sandwich shop in, for example, Moonee Ponds? The managers interviewed for this report did not know whether they were complying with the legislation and feared the imposition of the levy at a time of diminished income. They identified record keeping as a serious problem. The authors concluded that there was a need for a radical review of the act and its administration as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The training guarantee levy has been more a boon to beach resorts and exotic overseas cities than to businesses as such. It was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> in July last year that, according to industry estimates, up to 30 per cent&mdash;that is almost one-third&mdash;of the funds used for training involve overseas and domestic conferences that are little more than executive and staff holidays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In April last year, several hundred Australian businessmen, lawyers and doctors went to Hong Kong in time for the annual rugby sevens tournament. Many were aided in their travels by the training levy. Numerous legal and business conferences which complied with the training levy legislation were held in Hong Kong during the rugby tournament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax office is trying to clamp down on rorts, but industry sources claim that the amount of pseudo training by companies could range from about 10 per cent to a third of the $841 million that is presently spent under the terms of the levy, or between $85 million and $280 million of this amount. I will give some other examples that have been noted of training approved by the tax office: travel to Brazil by a group of motor industry executives; a conference for political lobbyists in Honolulu; and a four-day luxury cruise on the Hawkesbury for members of the New South Wales Employers' Federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What should immediately be obvious and offensive to those on the opposite benches&mdash;particularly those from the Left of the Labor Party&mdash;is that most of this training concerns managers and executives. The training guarantee levy is being used by business to re-skill middle and senior staff, often at the expense of workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures at 28 July last year show that study leave was given to 36 per cent of managers and professionals, who made up only 13 per cent of the total work force, while only 9 per cent of labourers and plant operators got study leave, even though they made up almost one-third&mdash;in fact, 32 per cent&mdash;of the work force. So there is a great disproportion in where the funds are spent in terms of the training guarantee levy itself. If this proposal has the objective of somehow skilling the nation, particularly the ordinary workers of the nation, it is falling far short of those objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to Professor Richard Sweet from the Dusseldorf Skills Forum, many Australian companies do not require workers at low levels to exercise responsibility and skill. Recent surveys of the metal industry have shown that the levy has been totally ineffective in raising expenditure on training, particularly of blue collar workers. So much for care about the true believers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levy has been condemned by the Business Council of Australia as an inappropriate method of encouraging industry to train. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has also called for the scrapping of the levy. The ACCI did a survey of the effects of the training guarantee levy on Australian business, which it released this year. It concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The training guarantee survives today as a nuisance imposition on the costs of running a business and on the structure of training at the enterprise level.</PARA>
<PARA>The firms that participated in the survey indicated that there had been a slight to moderate increase amongst almost 23 per cent of their number. This, as the report states, would demonstrate a useful addition to total output if the aim of economic activity was training, rather than goods and services. But as industry training is merely a means to an end, which is to make economic activity possible, the measure of the usefulness of training is where there is a demonstrable shortage of skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only around 8.9 per cent of responding firms can be said to be experiencing skill deficiencies. Increased training is therefore only of benefit to these firms. The government's attitude is clearly that we cannot have too much of a good thing, but increased training costs where there is no benefit or need&mdash;the company's workers already being sufficiently skilled for the job&mdash;have to be taken into account in assessing this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Half of all responding firms experience significant increases in costs as a result of the imposition of the training guarantee. Furthermore, there is no reason to suppose, the report argues, that the training provided in firm A, for which there is no immediate need for training, will provide the kind of training needed to meet the skill shortages of firm B. One in six businesses found an increase in paperwork due to the training guarantee, and these are simply a dead weight on the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Training is being directed to satisfy a bureaucratic set of requirements, rather than to target the skill needs of the Australian work force. Recently, the Prime Minister's task force on regional development has found that the training levy is not providing the training for which it was designed. The Prime Minister's own task force recommended that the scheme be suspended for three years. The task force reported that the levy was not fully understood by industry, had received mixed acceptance and was an administrative burden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The training guarantee is a poor substitute for more difficult reform. There has been a failure by government to consider why industry has not been investing in training. This has much to do with our flat wage structure and, until recent times, a lack of industrial competition. What the government has served up is only training for training's sake. What we need, rather, are incentives for industry to train and for young people to take up vocational training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that many on the opposite benches would join the coalition in voting for the end of this nuisance levy if they had a conscience vote on this matter. Therefore, I urge the House to do business and the workers of Australia a favour by repealing the training guarantee levy. I indicate that at the committee stage of the debate I will be moving amendments which, if passed, will effectively bring the scheme to an end on 1 July this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that whilst there is some little attempt to add more flexibility to the training guarantee levy, that little flexibility is so minute that, for example, in allowing firms to average their training from one year to another, all it simply does is say that, if firms have a training excess in one year, they may carry that forward for an additional year. One would have thought that if the government was seriously intent in bringing about some real flexibility in the system which it had introduced, it might allow averaging of training over a period of, say, three to five years. But we see nothing of that nature in this bill. That indicates that there is no serious intention of providing real flexibility in terms of the levy itself. For those reasons, as I said, I will be moving an amendment at the committee stage of this debate to introduce a sunset clause into this legislation, the effect of which would be that the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act would cease to have effect on 1 July this year. </PARA>

I would like to inform the honourable member that this statement is absolutely and utterly irrelevant to the issue of the training guarantee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Training Guarantee Amendment Bill fixes the problems associated with the Training Guarantee Act. It honours this government's election commitment to do so. The Training Guarantee Act, which was enacted in July 1990, provides for employers to spend at least a minimum amount on training. The entire rationale behind this scheme is to make the Australian work force competitive on an international basis. We need a labour force which is so highly skilled that it can rapidly adapt to shifts in the international economy. The training guarantee scheme ensures that Australia is developing just such a work force. It means that, as the economy strengthens, a pool of skilled labour is available for the growing economy as and when it is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some honourable members opposite view the training guarantee as having a negative impact on small businesses because of greater direct and administrative costs. The facts are that, prior to the training guarantee, little or no training was conducted by any small business. Let me give the House an actual example of how the training guarantee has specifically helped small business:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A chartered accountant in a New South Wales country town, sensing business opportunities for the accounting profession from training guarantee, completed the Train the Trainer course. His first task was a request from a company that traded as a contract weed exterminator on the cotton fields. His client sought advice as to what training they could provide to their workers. The problems were as follows: their work force was seasonal, not well educated and constantly changing; the work was mainly digging weeds from around cotton plants with a hoe or a large knife; the previous efforts at training had been unsuccessful and the client was thinking of sending the money to the Taxation Office.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The accountant spent time seeing just what took place on an average day and found: the workers suffered numerous injuries from their implements; they had little knowledge of occupational health and safety; up to a third of the cotton plants were damaged by the weeding process; the workers had little knowledge of how to treat different classes of weeds. The accountant then arranged to plan and conduct classes in: occupational health and safety, covering safety footwear, sun protection and first aid courses for the foremen. A course was then devised to allow the various classes of weeds and their eradication to be covered. Foremen were then to be designated first aid officers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The accountant has since been contacted by his client who advised the following results:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since training, staff stability has improved; accident claims have decreased, leading to a reduction in workers compensation premiums; the weeding process has improved to such an extent that the need for recalls because of unsatisfactory work has been eliminated; the client estimated that the savings to his firm were $30,000 for the first six months. The savings to their clients and the economy in general just from this example would be great.</PARA>
<PARA>This example shows the absolute and undeniable value of the training guarantee to Australian small businesses. Occupational and health and safety training is one of the major planks upon which the training guarantee is pinned. Many Australian employees do not pay as much attention to occupational health and safety as they ought. An article from yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> by industrial reporter Nicholas Johnson highlights the extreme importance of training in this area. He wrote:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But seriously, there is a range of reasons why voting patterns have increasingly changed in the last decade. These reasons are long-term trends both nationally and internationally. In Australia since 1980 the non-major party vote has grown from four per cent to 18 per cent on average around Australia in state and federal elections. In between elections, polls routinely indicate up to a 20 per cent non-major party vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992, 11 of the 15 Australian houses of parliament were not controlled by the executive governments. It is true that this has slipped back to six out of 15 and that the non-major party vote dropped to about 11 per cent at the highly polarised 1993 election. However, this was due primarily to the strident personalities of the leaders and the radical policies of the opposition and, in my view, is simply a bump in the graph. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The underlying reasons for the multiplicity of Independent candidates and minor parties remain in spite of the difficulties for them of funding and the `winner take all' single member electorate systems. These reasons are many: the changing electoral bases of political parties; the decline of rigid party identification; demographic shifts such as falling rural populations and growing coastal areas, immigration and general transience; labour market changes; reduced employment in manufacturing; the decline of unionism; the growth of women in the work force and their increased political activism; the spread of education; and, most of all, the growth of the ethic of participation since the 1960s and the consequent dissatisfaction with the basis of traditional representative government. This has led to the growth of well organised interest groups in Australia and around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was inevitable that the rate of change, both economic and social, and the deregulation of the 1980s would affect political systems and allegiances. The massive political reorganisations occurring throughout the world are evidence of this. The current moves here towards republicanism and constitutional reform are part of that change. The traditional political duopoly cannot stand aside from the forces of deregulation and competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The centralisation of power in both parties has led to a steadily declining membership and a paucity of candidates. The seemingly endless parade of both major and minor political corruption scandals revealed by increasing media scrutiny has forced many people to look for alternative representation. Frankly, unless the major parties make a concerted effort, the present public perception of them as self-serving institutions with endlessly expanding perks and lurks, existing mainly to distribute public funds to supporters and perpetuating themselves in office, will accelerate their disintegration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The gradual adoption of proportional voting in upper houses has encouraged tactical voting and further weakened major party allegiance. Many of these features are evident in democracies around the world, as is the rise of interest groups, minor parties and Independents. Possibly the main reason why the Australian two-party rigidity has held up as long as it has is compulsory voting. This tends to reduce electoral volatility with its 30 per cent largely apathetic major party vote acting as a shock absorber at national elections and perhaps 50 per cent at state levels. It should be remembered that compulsory voting is a system traditionally used mainly by right wing dictatorships, communist countries and Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the North Shore by-election the fact that an Independent, Robyn Read, is even a serious contender is evidence of all of these trends. One major party, Labor, has given up. The Liberals are running a three-time loser as a candidate, the recipient of `jobs for the girls', who is now involved in another version of politicisation of the Public Service and a sports rorts controversy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a commentary on a major party's ability to attract candidates. The reason the inner city areas of Sydney have seen the development of independent voting patterns is that they are the most extreme examples of all the deregulating characteristics.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 30 September last year in this place, I supported a New South Wales pharmacist, Stuart Keen, in his bid to assert his customers' right to choose cheaper `benchmark' brands of drugs when having prescriptions dispensed. At that time, there was a deal of publicity on the subject, including several television excerpts in the ABC's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> of 6 July, 25 August in Sydney and 26 August in Melbourne. These highlighted Mr Keen's courage in attempting to save his customers unnecessary expense, even though they and he were allegedly being harassed by officers of the Health Insurance Commission during their official investigation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even then, there was abundant evidence from this country as well as others, including the United States and Britain, that benchmark or lower priced drugs were being substituted widely to replace the more expensive premium brands, particularly in hospitals. It seemed evident that the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association were being ultra conservative in their opposition to dispensing benchmark drug brands. It also appeared that some members of the medical profession were resistant to change in this respect. However, at least partly due to Mr Keen's persistent efforts on behalf of his patients, there was a softening of attitude in favour of the cheaper benchmark brands and customers visiting a pharmacy were closer to being able to exercise their personal choice of drug type. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, since then I am sorry to say that the situation has taken a turn for the worse, which is my reason for speaking on this same topic tonight. On 21 December last year, Stuart Keen was issued with a summons relating to charges brought against him by Mr David Charles Stuart, Senior Investigating Officer with the Health Insurance Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not for me to comment on these charges, being well aware of the concerns surrounding sub judice matters, but I can question the circumstances surrounding the summons. It seems curious that the summons, dated 12 November, was not issued until a few days before Christmas, even though the court appearance was set for 18 January. As most people would agree&mdash;keeping in mind the fact that many professional services, including those of the legal profession, are unavailable due to the season's festivities and holidays&mdash;the issuing of a summons immediately prior to Christmas for a court appearance on 18 January certainly imposed an unnecessary time limit on the defendant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even more disturbing is the fact that the summons was dated approximately five weeks earlier&mdash;that is, 12 November. One would have to ask why there should have been such a delay in issuing a summons for a mid-January court appearance. It is also necessary to question the timing of a fax received by Mr Keen's solicitor, Mr Paul Baker of Ebsworth and Ebsworth, at 5.09 p.m. on 17 January, which sought to amend the information deleting five of the original 33 charges and adding a further two, when the parties were due in court at 10 a.m. the next day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems a pity that the Health Insurance Commission feels a need to be petty, vindictive and wasteful of the taxpayer's dollar in its efforts to make Stuart Keen the sacrificial lamb of the benchmark brand affair when he has done so much to alert the public and the pharmaceutical and medical establishments to the obvious advantage of choice in this particular matter. If, as seems likely, the law is changed to allow for the substitution of benchmark for premium drug brands where appropriate, those who will benefit most&mdash;the sick and the aged&mdash;will be able to thank Stuart Keen. As I said last September in talking on this subject in this place, I believe that Stuart Keen should be applauded, not persecuted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Friday 28 January, Australia lost one of its proudest sons when Frank Hardy died at his home in Melbourne. Frank died at his desk with the form guide in his hand, preparing for Saturday's races. He was a complex and a lovable character. Frank achieved notoriety in 1950 when he published <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Power Without Glory</EMPHASIS> and when in 1951 he was charged, tried and acquitted of the archaic charge of criminal libel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frank was born in the year of the Russian Revolution at Southern Cross in Victoria. He left school at the age of 13 and worked in a number of unskilled jobs. He left school in 1930 in the pit of the Great Depression. Through 10 years of the 1930s, Frank Hardy experienced the excesses of a social and economic system which had broken down and the hardship, the deprivation and the misery associated with it. He said that it was those hungry years and the logic of his own experience which caused him in about 1940&mdash;he could never be sure of the exact time&mdash;to join the Communist Party. That was also the year of his marriage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frank remained a committed socialist. He realised that when he spoke out against the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia he would be treated as persona non grata by the Soviet government. It was some years after that that a visiting writer from the Soviet Union told Frank that they thought he must have died because all references to him suddenly disappeared from Soviet publications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frank Hardy joined the army in 1941 and served until 1946. He was a cartoonist before he was a writer and he founded and edited an army publication. His great storytelling caused his contemporaries to encourage him to write. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Too many people have forgotten the courageous stand of Frank Hardy when he fought for the wages and land rights of the Aborigines in the 1960s and 1970s. It was Frank who introduced his great mate, the late Fred Hollows, to the Gurindjis. It was Frank Hardy who was largely instrumental in assisting the Gurindjis to become the first Aborigines to win land rights in 1975. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frank Hardy stood for the principles of socialism. He believed that a social system structured without class and based on the freedom of the individual would best contribute to the elevation of the human personality and the development of human capacities. But Frank was able to reconcile a profound philosophical and humanitarian commitment to his conception of an ideal social system with the down-to-earth personal qualities which led Malcolm Muggeridge to refer to him as `the most Australian Australian'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frank and Fred Hollows were great mates. It was almost exactly one year ago when Frank delivered the chief eulogy at the remembrance service in St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney. As I said in the condolence motion to Fred Hollows, it would have been the first and only time that the chief eulogy to an Australian communist was delivered by his communist mate at a state funeral in the Sydney cathedral of the Catholic Church. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frank's life encompassed that remarkable period from the establishment of Soviet communism to its ultimate collapse and disintegration. In later years, Frank was embarrassed by his book `<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Journey into the Future</EMPHASIS>', which he published in 1952 following his visit to the Soviet Union in 1951. He regretted his praise of Stalin and often wished that he had spoken out against Stalinism earlier. However, Frank was a visionary who sought for the people of the world a social order that would enhance and elevate the human character. He said on occasions that he did not know whether communism or Christianity was the superior system because neither of them had ever been tried. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, in its obituary for Frank Hardy, said that he was fast becoming our most treasured Red. I think Frank achieved that eminence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I extend my personal sympathy to Frank's family&mdash;Frances, Alan and Shirley&mdash;and to Jennie, whom he described to me as his counsel, his confidante and his best friend. We are all the losers with Frank's passing. As he said when he delivered the eulogy for his mate Fred Hollows almost exactly a year ago:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will never see the likes of him again.</PARA>
<PARA>We can say the same about Frank Hardy. Frank's public funeral services will be held in the Collingwood town hall this Friday at 1.30 p.m. Perhaps a number of us will be there, with his family, his friends, his admirers and supporters&mdash;including the Gurindjis, the Eritreans, Gough Whitlam and others&mdash;to say farewell to a great Australian. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to say a few words about the supposed closures of post offices throughout Australia. The ALP government of Queensland has alleged that the post offices in country areas will not close and that no-one will lose their jobs, but in the next minute it is skiting about how it will make those services pay. Clearly, those services will not pay. Clearly, hospitals do not make money in Australia. It is simply a matter of whether or not post offices want to make deliveries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I saw recently a travelogue on Canada. A postman was delivering the mail to homes in the snow and in the tundra nearly 400 miles from the nearest town. It is with great pride that the Canadian government claims that every single person is a citizen of Canada and that therefore every citizen should get the mail delivered to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People living outside of towns in Australia will very shortly not have their mail delivered to them. The postal services to stations, to isolated mining camps, to isolated Aboriginal settlements and to people who live in the great outback of Australia from which this country secures its identity as a nation will cease to operate. People will no longer receive their mail as a result of the introduction of a user-pays system. Clearly, in those areas the user will not pay. What they know now as isolation will be nothing compared with what they will be looking forward to very shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once upon a time in this country we had security in our jobs. If we did not have security in our jobs in the private sector, at least we had security in our jobs in the government sector. It is now true that people in the government sector no longer have any security. Once upon a time I thought that would probably be a good thing, but having seen people live in terror I no longer feel that way. The previous speaker made reference to suicides. In the last seven or eight years we have achieved the highest juvenile suicide rate in the entire world. In the last 18 months, four of those suicides have been in the Charters Towers-Hughenden area. Suicides are very heartbreaking things to occur in one's area and they occur because people are sick with worry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen a number of our postmasters in North Queensland become alcoholics and die from stress. One of my friends died. The doctor said that his heart attack was occasioned by stress. It was clear to all of his friends in the local Lions Club that he was prominent in, that it was the stress that had been responsible for the death of this very great citizen of our town. Those stresses are being cold bloodedly created by people in this House. Those stresses are being created so that we can run this system at a profit. No-one believes in profit more than I do. I hardly gave a speech in the state house in which I did not say, `Profit is a dirty word to you people on the other side of the House'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a user pays principle. The way that translates for we people who do not live in the big metropolitan areas is that we virtually lose our airports in most of our country towns while Brisbane gets nearly $700 million for an international airport to cater not for Australians but for very rich foreigners who are visiting Australia. That is what the user pays principle has become. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The user pays principle means that our backs are broken from the taxation that we have to pay on fuel. A shearer in my electorate travels an average of 40 miles a day over the worst roads that exist anywhere in the continent to do his daily work. This same person watches a fellow worker in Brisbane have his commuter transportation system subsidised so that he pays about $3.50 to get to his workplace during the week. This is not fairness. This is a dreadful injustice that is being foisted on the working people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only does the closure of the postal services mean the reintroduction of the tyranny of distance in this country of ours, and not only does it mean the straw that broke the camel's back for many of our battlers in the country areas who are fighting to survive with an average debt in farming industries, for example, of $100,000 a piece, but it also means for the shearers, contractors, railway workers and some of our isolated Aboriginal settlements a burden which they can simply carry no longer.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Clinicians and hospitals are responsible for determining priority of access to publicly funded MRI services. There are waiting lists of varying lengths for routine investigations. However, specialists are able to make arrangements with the chief radiologist of the relevant funded unit for priority of access for patients who require urgent scans, especially for neurosurgical and neurological cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Waiting lists vary between the States with an average time for routine bookings of four weeks in Victoria. There is some anecdotal evidence that waiting lists in New South Wales are longer, but no comprehensive national data is currently available on average length of waiting lists.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">under the MRI program, States may use Commonwealth funds allocated to the program to purchase scans at privately owned MRI units where appropriate. However, this does not occur on a large scale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Yes. Reports indicate a wide range of charges for MRI scans at privately owned units. These units are not funded under the MRI program and the fees charged are outside the Government's control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Yes. The rebate was replaced by the Commonwealth MRI program, consisting of grants to the States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's MRI policy was based on the MRI assessment program established as a joint initiative between the Commonwealth and the States in order to achieve a planned and rational introduction of an unproven and expensive health care technology in Australia. The MRI assessment program was conducted over the period 1986 to 1990. The National Health Technology Advisory Panel (NHTAP), an independent panel of experts, provided advice to the Commonwealth and State Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the period of the assessment, an MBS benefit was available for MRI scans. This was an interim measure only, pending the results of the assessment. Five machines were purchased by the Commonwealth and located at public hospitals for the purpose of the evaluation and the MBS rebate applied only to services provided by these designated units.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The MRI grants program replaced the Medicare rebate in order to constrain proliferation of this expensive new technology. An open ended Medicare benefit may lead to waste of scarce resources through inappropriate use of the technology, reductions in quality and increased costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) The Government based the size of the grants program on the NHTAP assessment of the number of MRI units required to meet the needs for clinical cases where MRI is of proven benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) The national target of 18 MRI units to serve both public and private (non-compensable) patients mainly for neurological and neurosurgical purposes was based on NHTAP's recommendation of an approximate ratio of one unit per one million people. All 18 units will be operating by late 1994. Although there is a lack of hard evidence to support claims made about problems with access to existing public units, there is plenty of anecdotal evidence that some additional machines are required. The Government is currently examining this question, particularly taking account of new uses for the technology. The Royal Australasian College of Radiologists has made a detailed submission on this matter which is currently being considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(e) As stated in the answer to (1), clinicians and hospitals are responsible for determining priority of access. Critically ill patients would normally be admitted to hospital and receive scans as required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(f) The issues are being assessed. However, benefits of a grants program, i.e. to improve access to MRI while retaining control over proliferation, cost to the community and quality of care, remain valid.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All social security clients or new claimants for a pension or an allowance are required to provide documentary evidence to verify their circumstances, including those of the investments they own.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes. The Australian Protective Service (APS) is a sub-program within my Department, but on a day to day basis, it reports to the Minister for Justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The roles of the APS are to provide guarding services to Commonwealth departments, authorities and bodies, custodial and escort services to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, a counter-terrorist first response role at certain security designated airports, diplomatic and consular security within Australia, advisory services to Commonwealth departments and instrumentalities on various aspects of guarding and custodial services and related physical security matters and the provision of security arrangements for the guarding of property including hazardous goods and cultural property such as art exhibitions indemnified by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) and (5) The APS role does not include intelligence gathering, nor does it engage in such activity. The APS does, however, frequently liaise with the Australian Security Intelligence Services in order to: obtain threat assessments; provide information on (and discuss the implications of) security incidents that have occurred at establishments protected by the APS; and to discuss the appropriate security response to potential incidents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) No&mdash;however in 1991 a Regional Office of the APS purchased some equipment without authority. This action was investigated by an independent person and was brought to the attention of the Australian Federal Police. The investigation revealed no evidence that the equipment had been used for anything other than the purpose for which it was alleged to have been made, that is to demonstrate to clients how easy it would be for someone to bug their premises. The equipment was purchased for a sum of $545.00. The equipment was of a kind which was commercially available. It was disposed of immediately following the investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The APS is not "charged" to perform any functions, rather it is authorised by statute to do so. The work it actually performs is the result of contractual arrangements with its clients. It does, however, have limited arrangements with private firms as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) The APS has an agreement with a small number of security firms for the provision of marketing and technical advice and occasionally will co-ordinate the purchase of commercial services on behalf of the client. Firms in this category include: Chubb, Bio-recognition Systems and Visions Systems Limited. The APS has contracted Securitron to perform repairs and maintenance on security systems at the Westbridge/ Villawood Immigration Detention Centre. Payments in the order of $20,000 are expected to be made for these services during the 1993/94 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Private security firms are generally only contracted to provide and install security alarms and similar technology which is then monitored by the APS&mdash;the APS has never deployed private security personnel to undertake guarding or other functions performed by the APS. (The only exception occurred during the Gulf crisis when the APS contracted the Corps of Commissionaires in Victoria to undertake guarding which the APS would normally perform itself but which it was unable to do because it had to deploy limited resources elsewhere to cope with the emergency situation.)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) Because APS officers work in the security industry, they would have regular discussions amongst themselves and during those discussions they may recommend an arrangement with a private firm. Any actual use or dealings with a private security firm would, of course, be subject to proper Public Service processes. In the course of dealing with clients, most senior officers would at times "recommend", but not "promote", the use of private security firms. They normally do this in the context of advising a client how they might obtain and install alarms and other security technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) The APS has no record or information to suggest that any officer or member of staff is a proprietor or shareholder of, or consultant to any private security firm. Moreover, as public servants, APS staff members are required to seek permission to undertake outside work and are also expected to declare any potential conflict of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) Cases of suspected impropriety are always investigated, and there have been two such cases in the last year. In neither case was there sufficient evidence to sustain a charge. There have been no cases of suspected fraud in the APS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) Members of the APS are public servants and as such are subject to all Australian public service legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) The APS is a division of a Department of State and follows the normal procedures applying to such a body with respect to the conduct of its members. Officers are required to disclose potential conflict between private interests and public duty, and applications to engage in outside employment are subject to scrutiny by the Secretary of the Department. Suspected instances of conflict or impropriety, patronage or victimisation are dealt with through normal public service disciplinary processes. Grievance avenues are open to officers and these are referred to the Secretary of the Department and/or the Merit Protection Review Agency and/or the Minister and/or the Ombudsman. Responsibility for conducting investigations lies outside the APS, although preliminary investigations may be undertaken internally if directed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12) Yes, but as indicated above, no disciplinary or other charges have been laid; accordingly it would not be proper to provide further details.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(13) Any member of the APS who raises a matter concerning actions by another member receives the normal protection provided to public servants in such cases. I am informed that the Director of the APS does not discourage such matters being raised and would immediately take disciplinary action against any member who threatens another under such (indeed, all) circumstances, provided there was sufficient evidence to support such action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(14) APS members normally occupy positions and perform duties commensurate with the rank they hold.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(15) When temporary positions become vacant, the normal practice is to notify them in the APS's internal newsletter, "UPDATE" which is issued weekly. When positions become vacant permanently, they are also notified in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette and sometimes in the press as well, in the normal public service manner. In some cases, however, advertising is not appropriate and decisions to transfer are taken to provide career development opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(16) The normal APS procedures as set out in the Personnel Management Manual Vol VII (as updated by the Public Service Commission's "Streamlining" booklets).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(17) APS General Orders, supplemented by instructions from National Headquarters limit the use of firearms to very restricted circumstances. APS officers who are subject to a restriction of the use of firearms (for example a domestic violence order) or who fail to pass rigorous six monthly theoretical and practical tests, or who for any other reason it is suspected should not carry a firearm, are not permitted to do so and are deployed to an establishment which does not require the carriage of firearms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(18) Yes. Where an officer's work performance is unsatisfactory, he or she is counselled&mdash;in the first instance by that officer's immediate supervisor. If there is no improvement the matter is referred up the line, with the final step being the institution of the formal Public Service inefficiency procedures. If an officer's conduct is such as to warrant some form of discipline, the matter is investigated by an officer authorised by the Secretary, who can lay a charge. The charge is then investigated by an Inquiry Officer appointed by the Secretary, who can impose penalties as prescribed under the Public Service Disciplinary Code. If an officer's conduct is actually or potentially dangerous to him or her or to others, the officer is removed from his or her duties and placed on other duties or to other locations or stood down.</PARA>
