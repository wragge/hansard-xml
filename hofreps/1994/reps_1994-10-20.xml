<PARA>HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cerberus</EMPHASIS> is the significant and expanding Royal Australian Navy training establishment with a complement of 132 officers, 310 senior sailors and 460 junior sailors. The number of officers and sailors under training at any one time averages 1,150, giving a total population of about 2,000 serving members. The Defence Housing Authority is responsible for the provision of housing for married defence personnel at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cerberus</EMPHASIS>. There are currently some 554 families located both on board HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cerberus</EMPHASIS> and ashore in the surrounding area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This project is aimed to partially redress the imbalance in housing available on board compared with ashore by increasing on board housing from 109 to 152 in accordance with the Defence Housing Authority's mission to provide defence personnel and their families with good housing consistent with community standards. </PARA>

<PARA>Russell has been the main administrative and planning centre for Defence for more than 30 years and is located at the third apex of the Parliamentary Triangle as proposed by Walter Burley Griffin. The Russell Defence complex consists of 15 buildings, eight of which are considered unsuitable for renovation to current occupational health and safety and building code of Australia standards. As a result, these will be demolished. Defence also occupies another 10 buildings in the ACT, and it is proposed that four of these buildings be vacated and the staff and functions relocated to Russell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The redevelopment proposal will provide 54,000 square metres of new office accommodation in two buildings, each of 22,500 square metres and a third of 9,000 square metres; and 30,000 square metres of office accommodation as a result of the refurbishment of four of the existing buildings. The Department of Defence has been working with the National Capital Planning Authority to define the planning constraints to be imposed on any new development at Russell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence will also carry out the necessary roadworks to create the development sites in accordance with the National Capital Planning Authority's proposed amendments to the capital plan. The project will be undertaken at an estimated out-turn cost of $212 million, and it is anticipated that construction will start in March 1995 and continue until the year 2000.

<PARA>The Land Warfare Centre, Canungra, which this year saw the establishment of the defence intelligence wing, DIW, is a vital training establishment for the Australian Defence Force, the ADF, with a complement of 364 posted military personnel. The Defence Housing Authority is responsible for the provision of housing for married defence personnel at LWC, Canungra. There are some 211 families located on the base and in the surrounding Gold Coast area. Housing provided by DHA at Canungra is generally well below acceptable community standards and it is increasingly expensive to maintain. The lack of suitable housing is of concern to the military community and reflects poorly upon DHA and the army. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some spot purchasing of civilian community housing in the Gold Coast area, approximately 30 to 40 minutes from Canungra, during 1992 and 1993 has eased pressure to a limited extent but also served to highlight the poor standard of on-base housing. The work will include the provision of 56 new houses as replacements for existing substandard houses on revised lots. Work is expected to commence in 1994 for completion at the end of 1996 at an estimated cost of $7.6 million. I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not detain the House. I indicate the coalition's support for this motion. Some of us have long memories of the Land Warfare Centre, Canungra, otherwise known as the jungle training centre, Canungra. We have pretty ugly memories of that particular location and of the training that we were subjected to many years ago in the 1960s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have since revisited the centre and have noticed, as is necessary, that the army must have stringent training conditions. Equally, families must have totally adequate conditions and that is why we support this reference to the public works committee. From my own experience, I have seen the operation of this committee second-guess some of the recommendations that are brought forward from time to time and improve on those recommendations with regard to some of the detailed aspects of redevelopment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One case in point was at Albury-Wodonga, and this may well be the case at Canungra. Certainly, additional housing of adequate standard for service families in close proximity to the Land Warfare Centre and a new defence intelligence wing at Canungra are worthy of support, given the very high cost of accommodation that pertains on the coastal corridor just to the east of that location. I therefore support the motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to all of that, there is an under-recognised museum at Canungra, which relates to the coast watching services that were provided during World War II, the 50th anniversary of which we are leading to the culmination of next year. I commend that particular facility as one worthy of a visit as it recognises that part of our rich military heritage. </PARA>

<PARA>The 1992-93 budget provided for the refurbishment of Scarborough House together with construction of an annex building to provide office accommodation for the AIPO in the Woden town centre. Scarborough House has not undergone major refurbishment since constructed in 1970. The building's internal fabric is now at the end of its economic life and its services are generally below currently required standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal is for the total refurbishment of the building and upgrading of base building services to be of a standard commensurate with current commercial office building standards. The proposed new building will provide approximately 10,400 square metres of net lettable area for offices and approximately 600 square metres of net lettable area for storage. The estimated outturn costs for both the Scarborough House refurbishment and the new building's construction&mdash;including AIPO's fitout cost&mdash;is $50.38 million. The project will be undertaken in two stages with the construction of the new building scheduled to commence in July 1995 and it will conclude with the refurbishment of Scarborough House to be completed by February 1998.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Joint Committee on Native Title, I present the first report of the committee entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Consultations during August 1994</EMPHASIS>, together with the evidence received by the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr LATHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;This committee was formally established with the full complement of its members in May. The committee chose to use the winter parliamentary recess to consult widely across the nation. Consultation meetings were held in Sydney, Brisbane, the north of Queensland, Perth and the north of Western Australia. The committee had discussions with the Western Australian government, miners, farmers, the tourism industry, lawyers, local government authorities, Aboriginal people and Aboriginal organisations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report does not make recommendations regarding the government's native title legislation, but it summarises the issues raised from consultations with the committee. It is the view of the committee that it is still too early in the implementation of the native title legislation to make a definitive judgment on the need for amendments or recommendations to this House or the Senate. Rather, it is the view of the committee that the clarification of the Mabo II decision that will arise out of the High Court consideration of challenges by the Western Australian government and also challenges by Aboriginal groups in Western Australia to their state legislation needs to be understood before the parliament can make any definitive judgment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My early impression is that the government can be well pleased with the progress of its native title legislation. While changes to the legislation may usefully be considered after the Western Australian government's High Court challenge next year, there is no evidence to justify rushed amendments. The legislation should be allowed to work in practice, free from pre-emptive strikes against native title by the coalition parties and business interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each of the concerns of industry can be resolved under the current provisions. Quite simply, the Native Title Act is not aggressively set against the interests of private investment. Unlike the Northern Territory legislation, it has no mining veto. Special measures under the 1975 Racial Discrimination Act have been used to secure leases and freehold tenure. At a cost of just $300 and with minimal delay, businesses can lodge non-claimant applications under the legislation to clarify whether native title applies to the parcels of land in which they hold an economic interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, some captains of industry are on edge and have presented their concerns to the committee. They have been agitating under the all-purpose banner of investment uncertainty. In a market economy, certainty never exists: only varying degrees of uncertainty. When asked in Brisbane to define his argument for certainty under the Native Title Act, the head of the Queensland Mining Council expressed an expectation for all legal issues to be fully resolved. In the early days of any new statute, not just native title, this is near impossible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our system of government allows the parliament to enact and the courts to interpret. Legal certainty on native title must await the High Court challenges and a range of test case claims in the Federal Court. Without the Native Title Act, the High Court's 1992 Mabo II ruling would by now have produced at common law scores of native title claims and injunctions, each questioning the validity of freehold and leasehold investments. This would have been the mother of all uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mining and pastoral industry chiefs have concentrated their complaints on the so-called low threshold test whereby claims on pastoral leases have been registered by the Native Title Tribunal. Even though valid pastoral leases extinguish native title, the act of extinguishment may raise issues of compensation paid by government and land access, which the tribunal or Federal Court can properly consider. Coexistence, where graziers and Aborigines use the land on a pastoral lease, need not damage the interests of either party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Law Society of New South Wales has testified to the committee that the legal rights of property holders and leaseholders are in no way diminished by the low threshold test. The National Farmers Federation is aware that non-claimant applications could clarify this issue for its membership but so far has failed to act. Pastoralists have in their hands the catalyst for dealing with claims of uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Claims of reduced mining exploration or delayed tourism permits need to be supported by a rational assessment of cause and effect, not just anecdotes and rumours. The peak industry councils should not be allowed to set up native title as a catch-all scapegoat for fluctuations in investment. As ever in the electronic media, simple misrepresentations are easier to communicate than complex facts. The work of our committee has been to sort through those suggestions and try to find instances of investment that has been delayed or cancelled. It has been very hard for the committee to find that definitive evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that a range of industry groups, especially those in Western Australia, do not want the Native Title Act to proceed. They are seeking to avoid the provisions of the act while undertaking private legal advice on the applicability of native title to development projects; that is, they are sidestepping the legislation, taking their own legal advice, and then proceeding on the basis of that advice with exploration and mining. Public claims of uncertainty and chaos are designed to mount political pressure on the legitimacy of the legislation. From consultations with the committee, it is clear that there is enough evidence for the Liberal and National parties to reassess their stance on native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is regrettable that not one of the committee members from the opposition is present in the chamber to contribute to the tabling or debate on this report. I would have thought that the shadow spokesperson on Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), would have been here contributing to the tabling of this important report. It is not good enough for the opposition to say that native title is a matter for states rights because in Western Australia leaving it to the state government means that native title will be abolished. That has been the purpose of the Court government. Consultations with the committee show that the Liberal Party's confusion about these issues is noted by Aboriginal people. It needs to do a lot better. I am not saying that the Liberal Party or the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) is racist in his views, but certainly paternalism underlies the way in which the coalition has addressed this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paternalism relies on a pessimistic judgment about the nature of Aboriginal people: that they cannot be relied on to make effective decisions about their needs and welfare&mdash;neither land, employment nor social conditions. Only affluent European stock can make these judgments. This is the missionary reborn into public policy. A truly Liberal Party  would regard any denial of decision making as a fundamental breach of human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any disadvantaged community, irrespective of race, progress cannot be sustained without a growing sense of confidence and higher expectations. Welfare dependency can only paper over the cycle of defeat among demoralised people. Access to traditional land is the key to lifting up the spirit and expectations of Aboriginal people. More than a matter of cultural rights, it is an essential foundation for economic and social justice. With native title and the tools of local self-government, each community and tribe can move closer to self-sufficiency. No Aboriginal group in Australia has ever argued that, beyond the short term, social and health standards can be advanced without access to traditional land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the Liberal and National parties to take a greater interest in the work of the committee. It is disappointing that the shadow spokesperson is not present in the chamber to participate in these matters. As a product of this report and the committee's consultations, the coalition should end its opposition to the concept of native title in Australia. This is not a matter of states rights but a true national responsibility properly discharged by this parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;When this Native Title Bill was first introduced into this parliament, I asked the people in my electorate, particularly those in the RSL, to reflect on how we would feel and where we would be as ordinary Australians had an invasion by the Japanese taken place. It is quite an appropriate argument, and there has been some discussion about that argument. But now, over the next 12 months, we will be looking at the 50-year anniversary of the war with its potential for invasion, and it is very much time for us to reflect on our own values and on the way Australian people would have evolved if, in fact, that invasion had taken place. The relevance of these remarks to this debate is that an invasion, in fact, did take place 200 years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The members of the Joint Committee on Native Title have been touring all around this country and having a good look at what is happening within this country's communities. It was my privilege, with a number of others on that committee, to go to Western Australia&mdash;it was the first time I had ever been to Western Australia&mdash;to tour through those communities and to see what has happened. Quite honestly, I have to say to this House that the love and tolerance that were shown by the members of the Aboriginal community were quite outstanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those of us who are members of the white Anglo-Saxon, Celtic and multicultural communities in Australia had experienced the havoc which has been wreaked on Aboriginals and their families, if we had suffered the indignities that they have suffered in their dissociation, divorce and breaking away from the land&mdash;even though the ownership of that land is not a cultural concept to them; in fact, it is the reverse: the land, the mother earth owns them&mdash;if our families had been broken up and our children stolen, which is what happened in New South Wales, I wonder whether we would show the same degree of love and tolerance that the Aboriginal people show. One of the big things that has really moved me about this issue is that level of spirit within the Aboriginal people. I think it is one of the truly remarkable things about the Aboriginal people in this country. If, in essence, you have to find a reason why they have survived, I would put it down to that great, endearing quality within them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report into the Native Title Act is the beginning of an investigation to try to make sure that the process that we go through works. Many great ideas&mdash;I will not discuss them now&mdash;are put forward by politicians, and then, after they have been translated by bureaucracies, are totally transformed and become completely different animals. We are attempting through this committee, through this first report and its subsequent reports, to make sure that the great idea, the great value that was put forward with this native title legislation, is translated into real communities, into real people in the fabric of Australian life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have great respect for the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and for the vision and leadership he has shown in the hard ball game of politics, which have enabled us to make this courageous decision and to now follow it through. Mr Speaker, I am sure that you will find, as will everyone else in this House, that those from both sides of the House who are serving on this committee will put all their efforts into making sure that this committee reflects the true values of the Australian community&mdash;values that are there, even though we cannot always see them. I speak of the values of toleration and inclusion and of that old much used cliche of `a fair go'. It has taken us a long time to realise that Aboriginal Australians should also get that fair go. But there is another old adage: it is never too late. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have made that decision and we have formed this committee to make sure that our high ideals are translated into real policies. We realise that our high ideals have to be delivered and that the bureaucracy has to put in place the appropriate arrangements. That is the task that confronts this committee, and this report is the first of an ongoing series. I commend the report to the House. I hope that the work which the committee undertakes in the future will ensure that we earn the long-term respect of the community for the decisions that we have made in this place. </PARA>

It is with regret that I have come to learn that this debate on the first report of the parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title has been a somewhat political one. It is always of great distress to me when these types of committees become too political. My understanding is that most of these joint committees work best when they are not political. I once shared a committee with the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh), who is at the table, and I was always delighted that the committee never brought down a minority report; the members of the committee worked very well together.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In August this year the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) released the government's response to the 60 recommendations of the committee on matters of policy. The Finance minute I have just tabled is the second and final part of the government's response to the report. The Finance minute addresses the 88 recommendations of the committee which deal with administrative matters. In summary, the vast majority of the committee's recommendations have been accepted and are being implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the most significant policy recommendations agreed to by the government are: to establish the tax law improvement project, the aim of which is to rewrite and simplify the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936; to establish a small taxation claims tribunal to provide a cheap and streamlined review process for taxpayers with claims below $5,000; to sponsor the development of a charter of taxpayer rights to better define the relationship between taxpayers and the Australian Taxation Office; to create a taxation ombudsman within the office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman to provide a discrete and readily identifiable avenue of administrative review for taxpayers; and to publish rulings issued by the tax commissioner in the Commonwealth <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> and table them in parliament within five sitting days of publication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The administrative recommendations accepted by the government cover such matters as: encouraging the further development of the ATO's computer systems, particularly to allow external access to some databases; providing explanatory information which is well targeted, accurate and up to date; improving the quality of training for staff involved in tax audits; and restructuring the ATO and reorganising particular groups within the office. The measures contained in the Finance minute, in conjunction with those announced by the Assistant Treasurer, will go a long way towards ensuring that ordinary taxpayers are treated fairly, are clearly informed of their rights and have access to appropriate forms of administrative review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is vitally important that the momentum for change which has been generated by the committee's inquiry and by the positive nature of the government's response not be lost. The committee, therefore, intends over the next few months to meet with the tax commissioner, Michael Carmody, to discuss the implementation of those recommendations which have been accepted and also to meet with the director of the tax law improvement project, Brian Nolan, to discuss progress in the simplification of the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rewrite of the tax act is a very significant undertaking with potentially huge benefits for the Australian community. Although the early results from the improvement project are encouraging, I know that there are some in the tax profession who are concerned that the complexity of the tax laws will not be substantially reduced unless questions of tax policy are considered as they arise. I am inclined to agree that the best results will be achieved if the substantive provisions of the law are reviewed at the same time as the words are being redrafted. The work of the Corporations Law simplification program shows that such a task can be undertaken successfully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, as the Finance minute acknowledges, the committee's report has created a real opportunity for change. I am pleased that the government and tax office have shown a willingness to grasp the opportunity, and I am hopeful that the changes being made will be to the benefit of all taxpayers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I am pleased to present, on behalf of the members of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the committee's annual report of activities for 1993-94. This report, which is the 334th tabled by the committee since 1951, presents an overview of the committee's activities for the last financial year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee began the practice of presenting annual reports to parliament in 1976. Prior to that date, the committee regularly prepared indexes of committee reports for the information of parliament and less frequently tabled statements of committee activities and procedures. The committee's decision to prepare annual reports was explained in the 1979 annual report in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reporting this way to parliament, the committee has recognised its responsibility as a statutory body to report on its activities. This committee has always taken the view that bodies established by the parliament should report to the parliament and has been in the vanguard of encouraging increased standards and regularity in reporting.</PARA>
<PARA>This statement is as valid today as it was in 1979. The period 1993-94 was a year in which the committee tabled five reports, published a discussion paper in relation to its inquiry into the administration of Commonwealth-state agreements for specific purpose payments and gave its approval to a new set of annual report requirements for Commonwealth departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most significant of the reports tabled was undoubtedly report 326, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An assessment of tax</EMPHASIS>, which I tabled the finance minute on today. The inquiry was a significant exercise which generated considerable attention within government circles and the wider community. It is the committee's hope that its recommendations will lead to real improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of Australia's tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other reports tabled by the committee in 1993-94 were report 327, which contained the committee's comments on aspects of the finance minute in relation to the report of the Midford Paramount inquiry; report 328, which was the committee's report of activities for 1992-93; report 329, which contained all the finance minutes presented in response to committee reports in the year 1993; and report 330, which presented the results of the committee's review of those reports of the Auditor-General which had been tabled in the period 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One notable development in the last financial year has been the committee's decision to give a renewed focus to its statutory responsibility to examine reports of the Auditor-General. The committee believes this responsibility to be one of its most important duties. The committee has developed new procedures to allow it to report regularly to parliament on its examination of audit reports. These procedures are described in chapter 4 of the annual report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another highlight in the committee's year has been its approval of the new annual report requirements for departments. The new requirements state that an annual report must be tabled by 31 October and call for a much sharper focus on past year program performance rather than on administrative details. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For over 60 years, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts has watched over the expenditure of public money by successive Commonwealth governments. I believe that the committee's work over the last 12 months has continued the tradition of helping keep the executive accountable to parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's achievements in the last year would not have been possible without the energy, enthusiasm and commitment displayed by my fellow committee members. For this, I thank them. On behalf of the committee, I also thank the very enthusiastic and hardworking staff of the committee secretariat for their dedication and professionalism throughout the year, which I have referred to when I have tabled previous reports in this place. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are considering today the Employment Services Bill and a cognate bill. This legislation follows from the government's initiatives in the green paper and then in the white paper Working Nation which was presented in May. When the white paper was first presented to the House, it seemed as if it was a sunshine document to drive away the dark clouds of unemployment. It was of little substance but contained a lot of light talk. This legislation goes to the heart of the government's commitments made in the white paper. The white paper announced a range of initiatives to achieve the government's stated objectives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons the House has become particularly interested in this legislation is that it contains a number of initiatives of a type that the parliament has not seen before. It establishes a working relationship between the Commonwealth Employment Service and a whole range of privately employed case managers who will be working on a contract basis with the CES or a subsidiary of the CES known as the Employment Services Regulatory Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ESRA's role is to make sure that the management of people who have been so unfortunate as to be unemployed, particularly those who have been unemployed for a substantial period, is done in a way that enables those people to gain the best benefits. What the government is doing is in a way inventing a new quango to move the management of long-term unemployment further away from the government. The government seems to be distancing itself and its agencies from the problems of people suffering long-term unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many features of this legislation of which one could be critical. The major thing that appeals to most members of this House is that the government is trying to do something about the situation, even if belatedly. It blew up the economy, it caused massive sackings and it produced massive bankruptcies, but now belatedly&mdash;three or four years beyond the time when it should have been showing some interest in the unemployed&mdash;it is introducing an initiative to help those people. We wish it well, even though the initiative is too late, it seems inappropriate and it has obvious flaws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The greatest flaw is that the government has declined to apply itself to providing sustainable job opportunities. Hence the opposition moved a second reading amendment to this legislation which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: "whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, this House deplores the Government's failure to provide real sustainable job opportunities'.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact of the matter is that the government has not applied itself to the detrimental employment features in the current economy, nor has it applied itself in budgetary and financial management terms to determining the most appropriate strategies to create employment. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) hates to admit failure or any flaw. The Prime Minister's overweening pride and his absolute enthralment with his own ability have meant that he and his lifestyle have become remote from the Australian people. As a result, he does not want to admit that he has caused a massive failure in the Australian economy and that he and his government have wrecked the lives of over a million Australians. He has done that but refuses to admit it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If he were to admit it, he would then set about facing the issue squarely instead of this window-dressing with a quango endeavouring to case manage those who are unemployed. At best this is a patch-up process. It is not dealing with the core of the problem for the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's record for creating employment opportunities is mixed. It certainly has created massive unemployment. Over the last few months with the slight improvement in the economy the employment position has changed. But today we read predictions from the Reserve Bank and others that we are not too far away from further dreadful times unless the government takes appropriate action to try to manage the economy and the processes needed to sustain employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the government has failed to focus on employment for Australia&mdash;what are the impediments to employment and how can we have the economy moving so that businesses and government can employ people? That should be a prime responsibility of government. But the government has not recognised that. Instead we have the legislation before us today, the Employment Services Bill and the Employment Services (Consequential Amendments) Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House was pretty concerned about the style of this legislation. I am thankful that the government agreed that this legislation could go before one of the committees of the House of Representatives&mdash;the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. It is an unusual process for a bill on employment to go before the legal committee of the House of Representatives. The original  concerns that were raised about this legislation related to privacy and to the role of the ombudsman in being able to check up on behalf of clients of the case managers as to whether they were receiving appropriate treatment, whether they had been properly dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other privacy factor related to the privacy constraints upon private contractors working with people who had been on the unemployment list for 12 months or so. In the process of counselling and encouragement of those who had been unemployed for 12 months, those contractors had come to gain a lot of private information about income levels, about family situations, about relatives, about attitudes, about possessions&mdash;all of which is part of assessing a person's eligibility for government programs, unemployment benefits, and government support schemes and encouraging them to take employment or training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there was concern on the part of the parliament about the privacy aspects that relate to individuals coming to a private contractor under direction of the Commonwealth government. It was not long, however, into the consideration of this legislation before the legal and constitutional affairs committee of the parliament realised that it was necessary for the sake of both the House and the Senate that we look more broadly than at just the privacy issues or the role of the ombudsman at fair play for the clients of ESRA&mdash;the Employment Services Regulatory Authority. It is not usually the function of a legal committee to look at policy matters. So it was a new experience to have before the legal and constitutional affairs committee of the House of Representatives people from a range of government and non-government agencies responsible for employment policies and programs&mdash;from the Salvation Army, the Brotherhood of St Laurence and similar organisations&mdash;to explain exactly what they felt about the policies lying behind this legislation and whether they would work. Because these agencies deal on a day-to-day basis with people who have been unemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed, it was possible to gain an impression of the effectiveness of the government's policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the committee made some very strong recommendations about the government's proposals, which were set out first in this legislation. In fact, the government was so pleased with the fact that the committee was doing this work that it decided to load another bundle of amendments onto it, hoping that the committee would pick up a fresh lot of amendments. The committee felt it was unjustifiable to accept these amendments and felt that it was completely inappropriate and wrong of the department to try to swing onto a committee of the House of Representatives matters to which we were uncommitted and which the parliament had not said we should investigate. The government bears responsibility for any comments or any mess that might ensue from that last batch of amendments proposed by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendations of the committee went to the heart of the legislation and found that there were a number of deficiencies. I will list some of the deficiencies because I think the public of Australia and those operating in the system need to understand why a parliamentary committee was appointed to carry out this task, what that parliamentary committee found and the deficiencies that it pointed to, both in the government and Public Service process of designing legislation of this type. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recommended in one instance that even the definition of case management should be amended. Case management is the process of taking people who are long-term unemployed and sitting down and examining in detail with them what is the most appropriate work pattern and the most effective training for them. This is done on a one-to-one counselling basis to try to come to grips with personal or geographical difficulties of employment, to try to come to grips with the core reasons that person has been unemployed for a very long period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the first recommendations from the committee's inquiry was that the bill be amended so that the case manager's role is more clearly defined to accurately portray the responsibility the case manager has to assist job seekers to find and maintain secure employment. That was a deficiency of the legislation. The very core of it was the case management process, yet the definition of what case managers were supposed to do was lacking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significant feature of applying responsibility to the very essential activists, the very central providers of information, sustenance and encouragement to those who are unemployed, was not in the legislation. The committee said that it had to be there or the legislation would not work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee found that the government had not applied itself to the needs of people with disabilities and those with other disadvantages, for example sole parents, in formulating the disallowable instruments. I explain to the House in passing that one of the features of this bill which I think is deplorable is having the framework of the bill erected and then being told, `Well, you guys are all going to find out what this bill does later because there is no substance in it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Employment Services Bill when first introduced contained nothing of substance to tell anybody anything. The government said, `We are going to have a whole lot of disallowable instruments.' Disallowable instruments are regulatory processes that limit the Public Service in the process of applying the government's policy. They say how much people are paid, how they can be sacked, what job specifications they should have, who their clients should be&mdash;all of that sort of thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very detail of the way in which something is going to work has in this instance been formulated in disallowable instruments. I find that obnoxious. The government has asked the parliament to undertake a program which it proclaims as the natural follow-on of this great white paper Working Nation, and to accept it and the legislation without detail. Talk about buying a pig in a poke or signing a blank cheque!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the strong objections of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs concerned why the government had adopted this mechanism as one of its major initiatives. Why has the government decided to keep secret from the parliament the way in which this program is going to work? Due to the work of the committee, the government and the department made a commitment that details of disallowable instruments and any other regulatory processes will be made available to the Senate before the Senate considers the legislation. When the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) replies to the debate, I want a confirmation that that will be the case. Otherwise, the government will be continuing with this facade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation in the House of Representatives is nothing more than a facade. Members of the House of Representatives do not know what this bill is going to do. We have a rough idea. All the detail is somewhere else: it is buried back in the department. Nobody in this place knows it. The government has a bright idea that it hopes will work, and that idea is basically supported and encouraged by those who are responsible for programs for the unemployed. The government has brought it into the parliament as a framework, but the detail of that framework is lacking. There is no detail at all. There is no substance to what the government is proposing. We do not know whether the disallowable instruments will give full attention to people who are disabled or disadvantaged. The parliamentary committee of this House believes that they should. The government needs to give that assurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The committee also said that it believes that, in the case management process, ESRA and the Department of Employment, Education and Training should look at payment on results. If we are going to have private enterprise case managers in this process, they can be employed forever on a piecework basis&mdash;so many clients per hour or per day&mdash;but nobody cares too much about the results. So payment for results was one of the recommendations of the committee. We want to see a greater focus by those case managers on resolving unemployment problems. We also felt that this process was necessary to ensure that Commonwealth funds were expended appropriately and that the government was not paying twice&mdash;or even more times&mdash;for an individual placement to be arranged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the central agency, ESRA, should take into consideration the difficulties that apply in rural and remote areas where it is extremely difficult to find employment. In rural areas you can case manage until the cows come home but, if there are no jobs, people are not going to get employment. ESRA should take into account the problems of rural and remote areas. There is also a need to maintain a service so that people can upgrade their educational and employment skills, even in remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consultative committees are part of this legislation. In western Sydney, we are in the process of establishing a consultative committee. It is the first step in the whole box and dice of this new age in which it is believed that by case managing long-term unemployed we are somehow going to get them jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I go back to my opening statements. This legislation is, no doubt, necessary and well-founded. However, it lacks detail, which is deplorable. It is also based on the white paper Working Nation, which cannot be counted as any more than a broad statement of intent and a whitewashing of the government's failure in the economy and the government's failure to think of the people of Australia needing employment. The bankruptcies and the sackings that have taken place under this government are shameful. The government continues to fail to apply itself to the needs of Australians, to the disabilities that are preventing employment and to the management of the economy in such a way as to create jobs positively through a healthy economy. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I will speak about that a little later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me take this opportunity to congratulate both the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon), who is in the House, on their tireless efforts in managing this rather momentous structural and administrative change to the delivery of labour market programs in this country. They have worked tirelessly to encourage employers to take up the range of concrete employment initiatives that have been provided under the white paper, and we are now starting to see the runs appear on the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My electorate has a very professional private case management sector. I am very much looking forward to its participation in the task that the community is facing in bringing the long-term unemployed and the generally short-term unemployed back into the work force as quickly as possible. We also have a very dedicated and expert public sector labour market delivery system. I commend the work that is being done by members of the CES, employees of the government of the day, in their efforts to come to grips with a problem that besets not only the community of Geelong but also many other communities throughout the length and breadth of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to briefly outline some of the amendments made by the Employment Services (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1994. They reflect some concerns and some proposals of a committee of this House. These amendments basically seek to amend the Freedom of Information Act 1992, to extend the powers of the ombudsman and to amend the Privacy Act 1988 and the Social Security Act 1991. These amendments are mainly designed to improve the flexibility and the delivery of services to clients and to protect clients and case managers once this particular case management system really grinds up, and I expect that will occur to an even greater extent as we move into 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequential amendments bill amends the Freedom of Information Act 1992 by providing members of the public with the right to access to documents relating to case management services that are held by contracted case managers. It is very important that clients are assured that they will have access to documentation generated by private contract case managers should they require it. The bill also gives the ombudsman the power to investigate complaints about contracted case managers. The opportunity is there for the ombudsman to investigate these matters or to refer them to ESRA should the ombudsman consider that appropriate. The bill also amends the Privacy Act by protecting clients in respect of information generated under this particular system. From time to time, information between the client and the contracted case manager is of a fairly personal nature. It is important for clients to understand, appreciate and have confidence that the information generated will be protected by the Privacy Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Employment Services Bill 1994 establishes the case management system. This represents one of the most significant reforms in the delivery of labour market programs that Australia has seen at least in the last decade. One could not expect that, with a reform of this magnitude, we would get great results overnight. It is a system that will improve dramatically over time. We ought not to have great and unrealistic expectations of what might be delivered in a period of some months with such a momentous reform. It will take time for the expertise and the systems to be built up, for the bugs to be ironed out and for the system to be working at its most effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even in the few months that this system has been in place, we have seen rather impressive&mdash;let me say quite dramatic&mdash;results. For example, in the period from April to October we have seen some 160,000 unemployed people enter that case management system. The figures indicate that in the vicinity of 2,000 case managers are now working in the field. The minister has reported to the House that the case management system is proceeding on schedule. As I have indicated, a natural momentum will be built up more in 1995 than in 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the House are very pleased with the introduction of this system. We have had a lot of debate in this chamber about the case management system, and members opposite have levelled some rather harsh criticism at the government's desire to quickly introduce it. But we all should look at this reform from the client's perspective. In the past, governments of all political persuasions have failed the clients in many ways. It is not a pleasant task for an unemployed person to walk into a CES office, which may be old and which may not be user friendly, go to a rather impersonal interview and then hazard themselves with everybody else on the unemployment queue to get a job off the board, so to speak. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployed people will now, under the case management system, receive far more personalised attention in addressing their particular needs and their particular problems. The case management system will provide an assessment of job readiness to that unemployed person. There will be personal contact between the unemployed person and the bureaucracy&mdash;in this case, the case manager&mdash;on a continuing basis over time. They will be dealing with somebody who, like themselves, has a vested interest in the success of what is being undertaken and who is committed to achieving results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is also overlooked is the positive impact that this will have on the employees of the government&mdash;I am referring to public sector managers&mdash;who will receive a lot of personal benefit from this sort of exchange. They will undertake a more personal contact with clients, will have a better opportunity to develop their own personal skills and work skills and will have a very powerful and strong interest in achieving outcomes. This is what the government is really on about&mdash;achieving real outcomes with the introduction of this system. From society's perspective, when it is outlaying significant amounts of money to this task, we will get greater efficiency and a better result from the dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take issue with the opposition on the way that it has criticised the government for the introduction of this initiative. I do so on the basis that it has argued before this House that the only people who will gain employment from the introduction of this system will be those in the public sector. That may be so. There may be an increase in the number of people who are employed in the public sector. But the opposition cannot then come into the House and say, `You set a target for 2,000 case managers by this time. There aren't 2,000 case managers working in the field. You have failed.' Those opposite cannot mount that particular argument. It is not a valid way of approaching the argument. The minister refuted that in the House the other day when he said, `If you can achieve a significant outcome&mdash;a target ahead of schedule&mdash;with a minimum number of staff and you are doing it efficiently and effectively, surely that is the name of the game. Surely you should attempt to do that?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen a dramatic and significant improvement in unemployment over time. Those opposite have always criticised the government for the fact that it has not created jobs. It is not the role of government to create the jobs. It is the role of government to set the general economic framework in which the private sector will invest and enterprises and employment will grow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any fair analysis of what Australia is experiencing at this point compared with some 10 years ago would indicate that we have the best framework in place and the best chance of the private sector growing and creating the jobs that we so desperately need. We have high growth&mdash;the highest growth in the OECD. In an historical sense, we have a low level of interest rates. We are enjoying low levels of inflation. We have seen the profitability of enterprises grow dramatically and with that their capacity to invest in new plant and equipment, which allows the economy to grow even further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen significant structural adjustments in the economy that are now yielding massive increases in productivity. More importantly, we have seen a very low level of industrial disputation in this country, which has added to a better investment climate and a better rate of productivity in the economy. What is the upshot of this? Since October 1993 unemployment levels have fallen from 964,400 to 836,100 in September 1994. In February 1994 there were 365,900 long-term unemployed. In August 1994 that figure had reduced by some 20 per cent to 290,100. Since April 1993 employment growth has been in the order of 413,800 people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government gave a commitment to the Australian people that it would set an economic framework for the next three years of its term in office that would see the creation of some half a million jobs. There is the evidence: some 413,800 jobs have been created in the Australian economy. The government does not create jobs; it sets the framework; it manages the levers. This government has done that extremely successfully, as the evidence that I have just presented indicates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have referred in recent adjournment debates to the rather encouraging signs that are occurring in Victoria's largest provincial manufacturing centre, which is also one of the nation's most important manufacturing centres. I will refer to some of the smaller statistics in the bigger picture. Since August this year jobs have been found for some 323 people who had been employed for over a year. In the same period last year, 227 jobs were found for people. There has been increase of some 40 per cent over the same period last year. In addition, we have seen the introduction of jobs in Geelong. We have seen that community initiative, which I referred to before, coming off the back of the white paper and pulling the community&mdash;employers, unions, the community and the government&mdash;together to confront this very real problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Geelong, we are seeing larger employers such as Ford and Alcoa taking on staff. We are seeing a dramatic increase in job intakes by small businesses; they are showing some very real interest in the labour market. If you want an overall indicator of how a local economy such as Geelong is faring, you would want to have a look at the hospitality statistics and see how many restaurants are opening in Geelong. We have seen a rather significant increase in that area in recent times. It is a very good sign. It means that consumers are coming out to spend a little bit of their money on recreational and other pursuits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) levied some fairly substantial criticisms at the government. I do not agree with many of the propositions that he has put before the parliament. The government has not just introduced this piece of legislation hoping that the whole system will work. It is working. I see opposite me the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), who has criticised the minister in recent times. The honourable member for Goldstein is a fantastic fudger of the figures. He is really the doctoring doctor of this House as far as the unemployment statistics are concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my happy task to bring this second reading debate to a close. In doing so, I thank all of those members who have spoken in the course of the debate, not the least being the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor), who gave what I thought was a very fine contribution&mdash;not only because of the flattering remarks he made about certain members of the government but also because of the substance that he drew upon in the course of his remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> On 24 August, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) in his second reading speech to the parliament outlined the effects of the Employment Services Bill 1994 and the Employment Services (Consequential Amendments) Bill in providing assistance to unemployed people and ensuring that the best possible services will be provided to assist them to find quality long-term jobs. Enhanced case management was introduced as a major initiative in the government's white paper Working Nation to support the aim of getting long-term unemployed job seekers into work. From the introduction of case management in April this year until 7 October, 160,500 unemployed job seekers entered case management. Of that, 112,000 people entered case management during the first quarter of this financial year. The number of job seekers being case managed is therefore well on target. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now estimate that around 462,000 eligible clients will be case managed in 1994-95 compared to the original target of 500,000 when Working Nation was released. This lower estimate can be attributed to the positive effects of the new case management arrangements and the strength of the economic recovery. I think no better illustration of the strength of  that recovery is in the number of jobs that have been created. Over the last 12 months, employment has grown by over 303,000. The number of long-term unemployed is now 290,000, a fall from March 1993 of some 76,000 job seekers. I think that is an indication as to why we have been so successful. Around 2,200 full-time case managers will be required by the CES to meet currently anticipated workloads for case management activity. The CES currently has about 2,000 case managers who are case managing job seekers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Employment Services Bill provides for the establishment of the Employment Services Regulatory Authority, ESRA, to regulate and monitor the case management system and for the formation of Employment Assistance Australia, EAA, as part of the Commonwealth Employment Service. This morning I will table disallowable instruments which have been prepared by the department and the interim ESRA secretariat. I have agreed that the next stage will involve public consultations to be conducted jointly by the department and the interim ESRA. ESRA has been given the task of developing an accredited system for case management organisations and ensuring that only organisations that can provide a quality service are allowed to tender for the delivery of case management services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of a competitive environment into the delivery of services to unemployed people is a bold new approach, something which was debated long and hard within the government and the wider community. But in my view it has been successful and will continue to be so. It has traditionally been the sole province of the public sector. Now community and  private sector organisations will be operating in fair and open competition with EAA in the delivery of case management services. Unemployed people eligible for case management will be able to nominate a preferred case manager, and the CES will make every effort to ensure that this nomination results in a placement with a preferred case management organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the referral of the Employment Services Bill 1994 and the Employment Services (Consequential Amendments Bill) 1994 to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on 25 August 1994. The committee tabled its advisory report on 22 September this year. I commend the committee and its chairperson, my good friend the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham); for the thoroughness of its inquiry and presentation of its report in such a short time frame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee conducted hearings over a two-day period, took over 20 submissions from a variety of groups and investigated the bills in depth. The committee expressed support for the thrust of the bills and noted that the case management approach is supported strongly by a variety of groups as a strategy for assisting unemployed people. The findings of the committee support the policy directions of the Employment Services Bill. I am pleased that there is a measure of bipartisan support for these initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee made 28 recommendations, 11 of which related to the making of disallowable instruments under the Employment Services Bill. The government's response to the committee's recommendations will be tabled shortly. Indeed, I will be tabling amendments to this legislation later this morning as a result of those recommendations. It is fair to say that in general we support the recommendations made by the committee, and the amendments will be in that vein. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments which we will move today will incorporate the government's response to those recommendations which would have required legislative amendments. I note the comments of the opposition spokesperson on unemployment, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), who in the second reading debate of 24 August applauds the government for contracting out some of its case management services. The introduction of competition to case management will result in a better service for unemployed people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to touch briefly on a number of matters raised in the course of the debate. The member for Goldstein raised the issue of the extent of ESRA's powers and questioned whether they were too wide. The Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs was not persuaded by the evidence that ESRA's powers were too wide for performing the functions provided for in the bill. The committee's report did not find widespread scepticism; instead, it found that the case management approach established by the bill is strongly supported as a strategy for assisting unemployed people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's report then quoted from submissions from the Welfare Rights Centre; the Australian Council of Social Service, ACOSS; the Disabled Peoples International; and ACROD. They all supported strong support for the case management system. The comment by the member for Goldstein that there was widespread scepticism in the community about case management did not spread as widely as I think he first thought it did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition's spokesperson on social security, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), questioned the information contained in the disallowable instruments. I am pleased to be able to share that with him today by tabling those instruments. The honourable member for Corio pointed out that the measures included in the white paper and the Employment Services Bill will constitute the broadest set of real reforms to the delivery of Commonwealth labour market programs in our postwar history. I think that is beyond question. These reforms will give the long-term unemployed a real chance to participate in the economic recovery. Again, I think that is beyond question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security, the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), eloquently expressed her support for the bill in the second reading debate and pointed out quite rightly the pessimistic aspects of the speech by the member for Goldstein. She made the point that the case management system will be phased in and that it will take time for case management expertise to develop. We all should acknowledge that. She also recognised that compassion, fairness and decency with equity and access are the hallmarks of both this bill and the government, and that the bill provides a climate for maximising opportunities for all Australians to participate in the growing prosperity of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased this morning to hear the member for Corio reiterate the remarks he made earlier in the debate supporting the commitment of the CES staff around Australia to unemployed people. Indeed, I think he highlighted the work  which has been done in his own electorate in assisting unemployed people to find work through the existing case management process. I say to those with an interest in this subject that it has been difficult for us to recognise that the CES has been required to do things which it has not been asked to do before. I thing that, generally speaking, the commitment which has been shown by the CES staff is to be absolutely applauded. I travel widely around Australia discussing these matters with not only CES staff but also employers, community groups and trade unions. I have absolutely no doubt about the level of dedication or commitment of the CES staff to the objectives which have been outlined in these pieces of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish now to table the draft disallowable instruments which have been prepared by the department and the staff of the Interim Employment Services Regulatory Authority. I hand a copy of these instruments to the member for Goldstein. The purpose of tabling and publishing these draft instruments is to allow the public consultation of these instruments before they are required to be made under the proposed legislation. It is proposed that the drafts be open for public consultation until 21 November 1994. I would welcome the comments of members of the opposition, and the government would be happy to facilitate discussions between the member for Goldstein and officials for that purpose. The department and the Interim Employment Services Regulatory Authority will publicise the names of contact officers so that members of the public and other interest groups may obtain copies of these instruments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two instruments, however, which I am not tabling today. The departmental information technology assistance scheme, which was recognised by the House standing committee as requiring the most detailed work, will be available for publication shortly. The instrument referred to in clause 32(10) of the bill, which deals with persons becoming eligible under the job compact, is not required at this stage, as clause 32(9) of the bill already specifies all people who are currently eligible for the compact. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The handling of the Employment Services Bill, which is before the House, has been totally unsatisfactory. The government has just introduced further amendments. These amendments became available late last night. They were in the hands of the Bills and Papers Office for quite some time before that&mdash;I think some days before that. My office has been unable to obtain them. We have been in constant communication with the office of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), attempting to get some adequate forewarning about these very substantial new amendments. But it has been impossible to get any clarity whatever from the minister's office about how he intended to handle this legislation or to get permission to get access to these amendments. According to the minister's office, these amendments were on the minister's desk and he was going to be looking at them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are witnessing in the handling of this piece of legislation is a chaotic approach to the introduction of the case management system. We are seeing the public expression of the same chaos which the Community and Public Sector Union has identified as existing behind the scenes in the department as it seeks desperately&mdash;and I have great sympathy for the department and for the CES because their members have been asked to do an heroic job&mdash;to put into place systems, whose aim is to help the long-term unemployed, which have not been thought through and were far from being thought through when announced in the white paper in May. We have the most extraordinary situation where the government announced in May a very substantial program to address a problem which had arisen under its policies over the last 11 years, which is the growth of an underclass of long-term unemployed people&mdash;a major component of the underclass living in poverty, locked out of employment&mdash;and a widening gap between rich and poor in this community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government finally in the white paper came to the view that it was going to have to do something to address this problem. It put down, as we remember, a green paper late last year and then the white paper detailing what it was going to do to help the long-term unemployed. It picked up in that white paper a number of the initiatives, in rhetorical form at least and to some extent in substance, which the coalition had put forward in the last election campaign. The concept of the training wage for which we were vilified was brought in, in concept at least&mdash;and I emphasise that because it is still not there in substance&mdash;in the white paper.

Yet this legislation before the House is aimed to establish the case management system and to put into place the Employment Services Regulatory Authority and Employment Assistance Australia to administer the case management system. As the parliamentary secretary tells us, the case management system is to be phased in. So, on the one hand, we have claims that the system is fully operational&mdash;as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) told the Hobart conference, 116,000 people have now entered the case management system&mdash;and, on the other hand, we are now considering before this House legislation to establish it.

The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) did not even claim that when he used the figure of 116,000 in Hobart. He said that 116,000 people had entered the system. There is a great difference between entering the system and being properly case managed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the government is proposing in the Employment Services Bill is a system which it claims will allow proper case management. As I said in my opening remarks, the system is not in place. Something called case management&mdash;and I have no doubt about the very good will of the officers in the CES as they attempt to implement and move ahead on case management&mdash;is in place, but it is very different from the case management that is being proposed. It is not at all clear how the present system is working and, indeed, to what extent people are receiving the kinds of case management services that the government has promised in the white paper. What we have at the moment is a rhetorical claim without very much evidence of real substance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already referred to the claims of the Community and Public Sector Union, which includes staff in the department responsible for and involved in the system of case management. The claims made in that union's most recent bulletin, the September bulletin, are quite contrary to the claims made by the parliamentary secretary, and they raise real questions over what is actually happening and whether the long-term unemployed are receiving the sort of help that they were being promised in the white paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The union claims, for example, that the budget simply failed to provide the extra resources necessary to support case management and other white paper activities. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) says to this House, `Forget that. What would you expect it to say? It is just after another grab for resources.' But it has negotiated with the department, and the department has apparently agreed to a draft agreement which will protect resources in other areas of the department's activity so that the other general activities of the CES network are not scaled back in order to provide case management. So there is a question over what resources are available and what effect that is having on the other activities of the CES. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The union went further. It said that there was `chaos' in the department surrounding the introduction and establishment of the case management system. It claimed that senior management in the department was trying `to frantically rearrange staffing resources to meet case management targets'. That could be a coloured version of what is happening: management is trying very hard to reach case management targets and the union says that it is frantically trying to rearrange staff, and that this is chaotic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The union goes on to make a further, and I would say very serious, allegation that the management of the department is `fudging' statistics to make it look as though targets are being met. Here are people who are involved in the establishment and development of the case management system saying to their members throughout the Public Service that, presumably based on the knowledge of people in the department, statistics are being fudged to make it look as though targets are being met. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The union's claims have not been refuted by the government. The government denies their validity, but we have to remember that those claims are from people who are actually and actively involved in the introduction of the system. Naturally, one would give those claims some credence. Why would one not give them some credence, particularly when they are so specific? Yet the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) expect us to totally ignore those claims, to act as though nothing has happened, and to accept the fact that the white paper is rolling along.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the government is facing enormous difficulty in introducing the white paper. This difficulty has caused significant and substantial delays in the proper introduction of the white paper. Earlier I mentioned the training wage. The training wage was supposed to be in place from 4 July. The training wage has been described as the centrepiece of the government's efforts to help the long-term unemployed get real jobs and work experience. Yet the training wage is still not satisfactorily in place. The minister chose to go down a certain route to introduce it. That route was to introduce the training wage by means of a national award. The ACTU told the government how it was going to implement the training wage and what kind of training wage the ACTU and the union movement were prepared to accept. The government went along with it, as it generally does. So what we have is a training wage that was established without any satisfactory consultation with those who were actually going to have to implement it&mdash;that is, small business and the employers&mdash;and who were then told, `This is it, and you will introduce it or not.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implication then dawned on the government that since the ACTU had insisted that a training wage be introduced via a single national award how was the training wage going to apply to people under state awards? How was the training wage going to apply to people who were not under awards at all? Those issues still have not been resolved. They are still being raised in the states. So we do not have, at present, a satisfactorily operating system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A body was established based on the Kelty-Fox task force, called NETTFORCE, to introduce and promote the training wage and to persuade employers. The agreements with the states under which NETTFORCE will operate are still in question; they have not been settled. So, although we were told back in July that this training wage would be in place to help people, it is still not helping any significant number of people at all. The long-term unemployed, once again, have been denied the sort of assistance they were promised in the white paper because of the great delays and mismanagement that have taken place in its introduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is so complex that the government agreed with the opposition that a standing committee of this House should look at the legislation and consider whether or not the powers that were given in this legislation to the Employment Services Regulatory Authority were too broad. The report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, a bipartisan committee with a government majority, is very revealing about what is happening. The committee made the point that this legislation had been introduced with enormous haste, so much so that a number of significant elements of the scheme were not available to the committee when the legislation was referred to it. The majority of amendments to the Employment Services (Consequential Amendments) Bill were received by the committee on 7 September, well after the public hearings. The committee report says:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The committee commented on the extraordinary amount of detail which is left to be provided in the disallowable instruments, the first of which we have just seen today. The committee made the point that this legislation should not be passed through the parliament until all these disallowable instruments had been subjected to very close scrutiny.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon) for offering in his speech to provide a briefing by officials of the department to me and the opposition on these disallowable instruments. We will certainly be looking at them in great detail to see what their implications are for the operation and structure of the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee, however, said that it was firmly of the view that some of the detail should be incorporated into the primary legislation and that the reason we have so much detail in these disallowable instruments is that, frankly, the scheme had not been fully thought through at the time the legislation was introduced. What a strange paradox we have here. We have a white paper which is really struggling to get up and running because of the way in which the government has gone about it, and effective assistance to long-term unemployed people being delayed month after month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat what I said in my speech in the second reading debate: there is widespread scepticism out in the community amongst the helping organisations in particular, bodies like the Salvation Army and the city missions and so forth, about whether or not this white paper will be effective in helping the long-term unemployed. Whether it is or not, we will have to wait for quite some time. Although it is now five months and more since the white paper, a great deal of it still has to come into place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the government's point of view, this is probably not a major problem, because the white paper has one overriding objective: for the white paper schemes to be in place sufficient months before the next federal election to be seen to be having an effect in removing a large number of people from the statistics of the long-term unemployed. The white paper, as Professor Helen Hughes of the full employment project at Melbourne University said, is really all about concealing the long-term unemployed from the electorate at about the time of the election rather than actually helping the long-term unemployed into sustainable employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the government's point of view, it is perhaps not a major problem that the white paper has got off to such a stumbling start and that the staff involved in the department, through the Community and Public Sector Union, have raised questions about the accuracy of statistics and whether its introduction is being handled in a chaotic way. But it is of great concern to the coalition and the long-term unemployed in this country that the white paper has been extremely slow to get up and running. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I referred to the paradox that the white paper has been slow in its introduction, yet the committee is criticising the government for the haste with which it has introduced legislation. How can these two circumstances be reconciled? The reason is that the government made promises and announcements at the time of the white paper which it had absolutely no idea how it was going to implement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An enormous amount of effort is clearly going on in the department by very well-intentioned officials to give the government a scheme that will work. All the time the minister is riding on the back of the department saying, `We have to get it in. The Prime Minister wants to see this white paper in operation; he has a lot riding on this white paper. He is going out telling everybody it is already in operation. In fact, I've told them it is in operation. Let's get this legislation into the House.' So the legislation came in and, of course, it was not ready. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As soon as it was introduced, there was a flood of amendments to it&mdash;44 amendments were introduced at the time when the original bill was put before the House. Further amendments were then later introduced when the bill was referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, and last night another swag of amendments was introduced. The minister must be wondering what is going on&mdash;`What is wrong with these officials of mine? They cannot produce a bill and a scheme which is to going to work. They keep hitting me with these new amendments.'

Therefore, it is not easy for me to address in great detail amendments which have just come before the House. But I do want to draw to the attention of the House the committee's views on the amendments that it saw.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also considered the policy of these amendments and the proposed structure of the case management system. It is very interesting that when the committee, a bipartisan committee with a government majority, looked at the policy of the case management system it said that `on balance' it accepted the proposed structure of the case management system with which these amendments before us today are concerned. That is hardly a warm endorsement from a bipartisan committee of the case management system. It was an `on balance' judgment by a committee dominated by government members. That is a fair warning, I think, from that side of the House that this whole structure that is now being put in place requires very close scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee heard evidence from members of the Disabled Peoples International, Australia, that the model in the legislation was not a case management model at all and that these amendments do not implement a case management system in the ordinary understanding of that term by people involved in welfare organisations. They said that the case management system is characterised, and ought to be characterised, by clearly defined roles and responsibilities that apply equally to the case manager and the person whose case is being managed. They are also of the opinion that case management is a process which requires great flexibility, and that it is very difficult to legislate for flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee itself was concerned over this matter and felt that it had some merit. It recommended that the definition in the bill should highlight and be adjusted to accurately reflect a case manager's responsibility to assist job seekers both to find and to maintain secure employment. There has been some attempt by the government to amend the definition of case management services in the bill presumably in response to this recommendation of the committee. But I believe that there is quite a distinct difference between the words which the government has used in the bill and the words which the committee is looking for. The government's words are that it is the case manager's responsibility to assist the person being case managed to find sustainable employment. The committee says that the task of the case manager should be to assist job seekers both to find and to maintain secure employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I read it, the committee is saying that the case manager's responsibility should not finish the moment it seems as though the long-term unemployed person has attained employment but that the case manager should keep a weather eye on the progress of that person and see whether or not that person is successful in maintaining that employment and, if that person is not, take action to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's amendment seems to terminate the case manager's responsibility at the point when employment is entered into. Therefore, it does not seem that its amendment adequately reflects or implements the recommendation of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The committee was also concerned about some other matters. I will seek the indulgence of the chair to comment on them at a slightly later moment. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

What system have they entered?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee noted in its report that eligibility for case management has not yet been determined. The question of whether or not somebody is to be a participant in the case management system is to be the subject of a disallowable instrument. When the committee considered this matter, it was told by the department that the disallowable instrument was in the process of being drafted. This meant that in fact no system was in place under the white paper structure to determine whether somebody was eligible for case management or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This immediately raises the question: who are these people who are currently being case managed or have entered the case management system? Are they people who would be eligible under the terms of the white paper or not? It is quite clear that the system which the department intends to put in place to assess the eligibility of long-term unemployed people, and people at risk, for case management has not yet been designed. So doubtless there are many people going through case management who would not be going through case management if the terms of the white paper were being implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It makes one wonder what is the nature of this fudging of the statistics that the Community and Public Sector Union has alleged is occurring. How are the numbers of those in case management being bumped up at the moment to make it look as though targets are being met when, as the union says, targets are not being met? It has been said that there is a view that some of the people who are notionally in case management at the moment are simply names on the computer lists and that if you were to approach some of these individuals and ask them, `How's the case management going?' they would say, `What case management?' They are on the lists of people to be case managed, the department considers that they have entered the case management system, but so far as they are concerned case management is not a reality of their lives; they are not really aware of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Questions have been raised not by the opposition but by the staff of the department and by government members on the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs who make the point that the system to determine eligibility for case management is not yet in place.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some other aspects of the amendments to this white paper and the bill which certainly warrant comment upon, and which were commented upon by the House of Representatives committee. The coalition has consistently said that one of the major objectives of the white paper has been to remove people from the unemployment statistics and put them onto other programs; to hide the unemployed rather than to help the unemployed. The committee expressed its concern at the fact that, under the provisions, participants in the jobskills and LEAP programs who are being case managed will be reclassified; their status will be changed. The committee's report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prior to the introduction of the Bill, participants in these programs were considered to be unemployed during their Jobskills or LEAP placement and thus retained eligibility for LMP assistance at the end of their program.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee is concerned that a broker may be paid for organising a placement and that the Commonwealth may also be paying a case manager to arrange that same placement; in other words, that there may be double dipping into the funds that are available for assistance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am at a loss to understand why the government is concerned that the coalition is making a number of comments on this legislation. I presume that the haste with which the Employment Services Bill was introduced and the fact that amendments keep pouring out of the government is intended to stifle debate on this matter. There has scarcely been enough time to consider and give adequate scrutiny to the amendments which the government has put forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a matter which the committee&mdash;which comprised a majority of government members&mdash;complained about and it is a matter which the opposition is very concerned about. The government should not consider for a moment that the opposition feels compelled to accept all these amendments just because the government has seen fit to introduce and move them through the House at this extraordinary speed. It is quite appropriate for the opposition to be making comments on the amendments before the House. If the government does not like it, it will have to wait. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has introduced a great deal of additional material which spells out the detail of this legislation. It has done this not only through the amendments but also through the 13 disallowable instruments, some of which have now been made available. We will certainly not be prepared to pass this legislation in the Senate until there has been adequate opportunity to consider the detail of these disallowable instruments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I once again draw attention to fact that the government's claims about the effectiveness of the system now in place have no credibility in light of the fact that what we now have before us is a very complex schema which is growing like topsy before our very eyes. The department still needs to produce a great deal more detail on the operation of this legislation before it comes into operation. It is the government's fault and the fault of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) that its credibility is being called publicly into question on the operation and introduction of the white paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only people who are suffering as a result of this are the long-term unemployed who have been placed in that position by the government's mismanagement of the economy over the last 11 years. They have had to wait a very long time to get some rhetorical acknowledgment of their problems. They now have that rhetorical acknowledgment and, when this system is in place, presumably they will have some hope of further assistance. Whether or not the system embodied in this legislation and in these amendments will operate to help them is another matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I now take this opportunity to address myself to the amendments relating to breaches of obligations by those under case management and, indeed, under the jobstart and the newstart arrangements. The matter was considered in the Senate. A non-government amendment to social security legislation in the Senate provided that suspension of an unemployed person from payments due to a breach of obligations under the act could only take effect following two further payments covering 28 days of jobsearch allowance and newstart allowance. The government has been concerned about this particular amendment because it causes administrative difficulties in the way in which it is worded, in particular, and seems, according to the government&mdash;and one can understand what it is referring to here&mdash;not to accord with the signals that the government wants to send to job seekers in regard to the importance of their reciprocal obligations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter has been discussed with me by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean). I have corresponded with the minister on this matter and notified him that, while the opposition has sympathy with the concerns of the government on this matter, we did want to see this issue referred to the legal and constitutional affairs committee for consideration. The government undertook to do that. Unfortunately, according to the committee, the amendments were not received by it until after public hearings had been conducted. The committee consequently, it says, did not have sufficient time to consult widely on them but it did have time to receive some comment on these amendments. It received comment from the Australian Council of Social Service and from the Welfare Rights Centre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Council of Social Service told the committee that it was extremely concerned by the most recent proposed amendments and that it was concerned that tighter reciprocal obligations constitute a punitive approach that is unhelpful and that runs entirely counter to the case management approach. ACOSS agreed that the amendment to allow deferral periods to operate from the time that notice was sent was necessary but accepted the department's views about the administrative difficulties being caused by the Senate amendment. It went on to say it was acceptable only if there was a period of notice. The Welfare Rights Centre sought to maintain the previous arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee investigated the issue. It came to the view that the system has some built-in safeguards that may make the additional two payment periods unnecessary on a number of grounds. It did feel that sufficient notice probably would be given to unemployed persons before they lost their benefits or payments because of a breach of the obligations on their part. The committee, however, did say that, in relation to administrative breaches, the matter was not so clear because the nature of an administrative breach is that the person cannot be contacted. It recognised that every attempt was made  by CES and the Department of Social Security to make contact and that a total of 35 days was allowed for a person to respond, which entailed more than two pay periods. The committee said that if a person is not responding to this correspondence because he or she is no longer looking for work and therefore no longer eligible for payment then the concept of making an additional two payments to the person does not seem to fit with responsible financial management practices. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The focus of the youth training initiative will be to encourage young people to undertake full-time education or training, entry level training, and appropriate employment opportunities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first strand of the youth training initiative will provide intensive case management to unemployed young people.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clients will be eligible for case management 13 weeks after registering as unemployed, with earlier case management assistance for clients assessed as being at high risk of becoming long-term unemployed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of the youth training allowance is a further policy development and will align benefits for unemployed young people more closely with assistance available under Austudy. In particular, the youth training allowance will introduce an away from home rate for unemployed young people who do not qualify as independent but who need to live away from home to seek employment or undertake suitable training. Payment of the away from home rate will be subject to certification by the Commonwealth Employment Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the clear emphasis on employment, education and training outcomes sought for the target group of the youth training initiative, the bill will establish the youth training allowance by amending the Student Assistance Act 1973, which will be renamed the Student and Youth Assistance Act, providing for youth training allowance, Austudy, Abstudy and the assistance for isolated children scheme. </PARA>

The main bill&mdash;the Student Assistance (Youth Training Allowance) Amendment Bill 1994&mdash;has 267 pages. It was introduced last Thursday afternoon and, consequently, there has been very limited time for the parliament to consider it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill has not been accompanied by a flood of amendments and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) is probably entitled to some commendation for that. It is a bill within covers and it gives some evidence of having had satisfactory attention given to making sure that at least all the components of the scheme are in place. Regardless of what one thinks of the various detailed elements in the bill, at least this piece of legislation has been put together and introduced in what appears to be a complete form. I may be proven wrong. There may be a lot of amendments to come, but so far we have not seen them. The government has created a good impression that it has got its act together on the drafting of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, I cannot be so complimentary on the timetable of this introduction. The government is really saying that it does not care whether the parliament or the House of Representatives, in particular, has time to consider this piece of legislation. As I say, the bill was introduced last Thursday night and is being debated a week later. In that time, the parties have had to organise their party meetings, shadow cabinet meetings and so forth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an unsatisfactory situation for such a substantial piece of legislation. I protest in the strongest terms on behalf of the coalition at the way in which this is done. I can assure the minister that this piece of legislation will get very close attention not only from those of us in this House but also from those in the other chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main bill, the Student Assistance (Youth Training Allowance) Amendment Bill 1994, is designed to establish the income support component of the youth training initiative. Young people are desperately in need of constructive assistance; there is no doubt about that. The circumstances that young people in Australia find themselves in at the present time are very difficult. Unemployment, as we know, has been exceptionally high amongst young people. This problem has a number of sources, but one of the major sources, regrettably, has been the decade and more of economic mismanagement which we have suffered under this government and which we are still suffering from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's boom-bust approach has had a disastrous effect on families around Australia, and this country now has the highest rate of divorce that it has had for a decade. It has impacted particularly on young people. The youth of this country have also suffered greatly from the attitude that the government has taken to the employment and training of young people. When the present Minister for Employment, Education and Training was a union secretary, he worked vigorously to close the gap between junior and adult rates of pay. When one compares the situation in Australia with the situation in a country like Germany, which has a long established and generally very successful training and vocational education system, what stands out is that young people in Germany move through a very clear progression of stages and wage rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Germany the concept of a training wage has not been controversial. It has been recognised that, if a young person is going to be successful in gaining employment, that young person must be productive when he or she comes into the workplace. Until he or she is as productive as more experienced people, it is entirely proper that he or she should be paid a training wage rather than a wage which is much closer to a full adult wage. This is a view which I have put for some time in this chamber and which the coalition put very strongly in the last election campaign. It is pleasing that since the election the government has at least picked up in the white paper the concept of a training wage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why there has been so much difficulty with this on the government side is that this country is governed under the terms of an agreement, a contract, which was reached and signed between the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Council of Trade Unions in 1983, known as the accord. The accord deals with virtually every area of policy. It means that the Australian Council of Trade Unions has in virtually every portfolio a veto over policy developments which it sees as impinging on its own interests. It has pursued a view designed to promote the role and the influence of the trade union movement on youth wages, wage differentials, and how training should be organised. I regret to say that that has been its first priority, not the interests of young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Young people have been the victims of this approach. Young people have been willingly sacrificed to maintain the wages system and the training arrangements which the trade union movement has seen as contributing to its own interests. This is deeply regrettable and it has had a devastating effect on the opportunities for young people in this country, whether they be opportunities to undertake appropriate training or education or whether they be opportunities to obtain employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Vocational education is not dealt with at length in this bill, but it is certainly relevant because it relates to the kind of training that is available to young people. It is a tragedy that we have not had a clear strategy to develop vocational education and training opportunities over the last 11 years. Since 1983 we have seen the deliberate neglect of training through formal institutions such as the colleges of advanced education and the TAFE system, which was greatly built up by the Fraser government. The TAFE system was put in limbo for virtually a decade. The colleges of advanced education, which offered vocational education and education relevant to the various regions of the country within which they existed, were pushed out of existence. They were told that they had to become universities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A former Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, at the bidding of the college unions&mdash;college staff were very keen to get the employment conditions and research opportunities of university staff&mdash;decided that the colleges should become universities. For a period of years we had young people in this country being told, `If you are not interested in university education, you are not with it. Everybody has to go to university.' So the colleges, with their vocational emphasis, disappeared; the TAFEs were neglected; and we had the young people of this country being pushed into university education whether that was suitable education for them or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government realised, some years after Mr Dawkins had had his way, that it had made a terrible mistake. His successor as the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the present Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), came out and said, `Australia has too many universities'&mdash;too many universities, after the number had been bumped up from nine to 38 by the former minister&mdash;`and what we need to develop is vocational education and training.' The government then said, `We will put more money into TAFE and we will develop a training system in this country which is suitable for young people.' All this time young people were out there wondering what on earth they were supposed to be doing, given the conflicting messages they were getting from the government. So Australia started to go down a different track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the features of this government is that when it changes course, boy does it change course. It suddenly shifts. It said, `The universities have reached their optimum size. They are now going to be cut back and the whole system is going to be swung onto training through TAFE. We are going to build up the TAFE system.' It was a bit like the case management system for the unemployed. The government said, `The long-term unemployed have been neglected so we will shift the whole system onto the long-term unemployed. All the skillshares will now take on long-term unemployed. We will push resources in the CES onto the long-term unemployed.' This approach to government has a sort of an eastern European flavour. The fashion at the moment, the top priority, is the one that gets the resources so resources have been swung into the TAFE area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia now has one of the lowest proportions of young people in the entire Western world, in the OECD, in industry related training and employment. A country such as Germany, which has had a well-established system, has always recognised that young people should have workplace experience as an essential part of their training. They should have experience on the shop floor. They should have experience that makes them productive in the workplace. This government has not been concerned about this because apprenticeships and traineeships have not fitted easily into the schema. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until recently, this country has had the lowest number of young people, as a proportion of the work force, in apprenticeships and traineeships that it has had since the 1960s. Australia has one of the lowest rates of workplace experience-based training in the Western world because of the total confusion on the part of this government as to what sorts of opportunities it should be providing to young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before us, which is part of the government's training agenda, aims to provide people who are under 18 and presently receiving the jobstart allowance with increased opportunities for training. There are a number of questions that we should be asking about this. What kind of training will these young people be receiving? Will this training be appropriate to their needs? As other young unemployed people have suffered before them for a number of years under this government, will they suffer the indignity and the demoralising pressure from the government to go through one short-term training program after another knowing that these training programs are quite disconnected from the labour market opportunities which are there? Will they realise that these training programs do not offer them the job opportunities they want?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us make no mistake about it, the way in which the government has gone about developing its labour market programs for young people has been one of the most destructive efforts we have seen in this country for a long time. We have seen the demoralisation of young people in this country. Many young people are despairing because of the lack of opportunities before them. I regret to say that a very sad indicator of this is the fact that this country now has the highest rate of youth suicide in the world. There is a sense of hopelessness around this country due to the complete confusion and lack of direction and vision from this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When a piece of legislation such as this focuses on youth training, the first question we have to ask is: will this training give these young people real job opportunities and increase their productiveness to employers or will it be more of the same? I see no answer to this in the legislation. But I do see an answer to another question that the coalition has asked on a number of occasions: what is the government really about? This is yet another approach which is going to have a very interesting statistical effect. Young people will be removed from the jobsearch allowance and put on the youth training allowance. The consequence of the introduction of this legislation&mdash;from figures taken from 20 May this year&mdash;will be that 37,346 people will be removed from the jobsearch allowance and put onto the youth training allowance. This seems to have surprised the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), the next speaker in the debate, but it is a very interesting fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I assure the honourable member that those people on the youth training allowance are still unemployed people, but that is not going to be quite so obvious. I have no doubt at all that government speakers will be going around this country saying, `Oh, look at the fall in the people on jobsearch allowance. This is remarkable&mdash;the effectiveness with which the government's employment programs are working!' They will not be saying, `Of course, the young people on the youth training allowance are unemployed and regarded as unemployed people.' They will just be focusing on the fall in the statistics of those whom the public understands to be unemployed, because those people are receiving what the public still regards as the unemployment benefit&mdash;the jobsearch allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is part of the general approach that the government is taking under the white paper to shift as many people as possible out of the unemployment statistics. It will be interesting to see what effect the implementation of the youth training allowance will have on the unemployment statistics produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Will the young people on the youth training allowance regard themselves as still being unemployed, or not? I suppose this depends on the kinds of training programs they will go into and the sorts of opportunities they will get under the case management system. It is quite likely that many of these young people will say, `Perhaps I am not unemployed after all.' So not only will we see a quite substantial fall in the numbers on jobsearch allowance, but also we may see this flow through into the ABS unemployment figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is all very good news for the government, which is why this legislation is being introduced. But it is not good news for this country and for young unemployed people. Unless they can be offered effective training and unless case management really comes to mean something for young people, it will be simply yet another example of how their interests have been sacrificed to the political interests of the government. I have no confidence at all in this. I can tell you that, having talked to a lot of young unemployed people since I have been in the shadow employment portfolio, there will be very little expectation on the part of young people in this country that the youth training allowance will do a great deal for them. There will be very little expectation indeed, because they know the way they have been treated in the past and they will want to see a very significant change in that treatment before their attitudes change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These bills introduce some substantial and significant changes to administrative arrangements. There is no doubt that the Student Assistance (Youth Training Allowance) Amendment Bill is a very significant piece of legislation from the point of view of the Department of Employment, Education and Training. It gives the department a large new brief and a foothold in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not all those who look closely at these matters are happy with this. A strong view has been expressed by some that there is no need for this bill and that the Social Security Act should have been amended. They ask why, as jobsearch comes under that act, the youth training allowance and other income support programs which help unemployed people should not come under it as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some rather unpleasant comments have been made about the capacity of the department to administer income support programs, based on the experience with Austudy. But there seem to be some improvements occurring in that area. Nevertheless, the question has been raised as to why this whole schema should not be put with the Department of Social Security, which, after all, is skilled in the making of income support payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One really has to question what the rationale is for this particular bill being introduced in this form. I have looked closely at the explanatory memorandum and have seen the explanations offered. They are remarkable for their brevity and sound rather like rationalisations to me. I would be interested to hear this issue addressed at some stage in the debate. It is of concern to a number of organisations concerned with helping young people and with social security and welfare matters generally. It explained why this bill is being introduced in this way. It certainly places a great premium on satisfactory relationships in this area being established and developed between the Department of Social Security and the Department of Employment, Education and Training. We would not want to see developing the loopholes and gaps through which people can fall that sometimes have occurred in the past when more than one department was involved in the administration of schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The youth training allowance depends for its effectiveness on the effectiveness of the case management system that is to be introduced. In principle, the coalition has no quarrel at all with the notion of case management. That is undoubtedly, in principle, an effective way to help unemployed people, particularly longer term unemployed people. It is a more costly system, but it allows the individual person seeking assistance to be treated for his or her individual needs. These needs have more chance of being understood. There is a chance of some continuity in the assistance given to that person and some potential for flexible adjustment. The concept of case management is one that we find attractive in principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> To say that it is positive in principle is not to say that in practice it will be implemented in a way which will work. In the debate on the previous bill, concerns were expressed from various bodies in the welfare area about the nature of the case management system which is being established. There has to be a major question as to whether or not we have a case management system which will follow people through in the way in which the rhetoric says that it will. Whether a case manager who has a load of 250 people under the job compact over the year plus who knows how many others will be effectively case managed remains to be seen. This issue I think is still to be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a positive factor that the government is jumping up and down telling us how many people are currently under case management or how many people have entered the case management system. Rhetorically it sometimes says, `This shows the white paper is up and running.' As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) told the ALP conference in Hobart, 116,000 people have entered case management. But what case management system have they entered? We have before us today legislation to establish the case management system under the white paper. I have no doubt that the officials in DEET are doing their best to meet the demands coming down on high from the Prime Minister and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, who say, `Please get this case management up and running so we can say targets have been met and the system is in operation.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard very serious comments made on this matter by the Community and Public Sector Union, which said that the whole system is presently in chaos in the department. It said that senior management was rushing around trying to reallocate resources to get people into case management at the risk and cost of other activities undertaken by the CES. Most seriously of all, it said that figures were being `fudged' to make it look as though targets were being met when they were not being met&mdash;targets presumably of the numbers of case managers and the numbers of people being helped by case management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am constrained to mention an example of how this fudging seems to be leaking up to the ministerial level. In early August the Minister for Employment, Education and Training told us that there were 2,000 case managers in place&mdash;this is to show how quickly the white paper was getting under way&mdash;and another 500 were to be appointed over the coming months to do the job. Then, several months later, he comes in and tells us that we have 2,000 case managers in place. The 500 new case managers apparently disappeared. The question arises not whether we have 2,000 in place&mdash;in fact, the minister's latest figure was under 2,000&mdash;but whether we had 2,000 in place at the end of July. I think the only conclusion is that we did not have 2,000 case managers in place at the end of July. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the union said, there are people actively engaged in case management who are being given case management ID numbers within the department. It has also been said that some of these people who are said to be in case management are in case management only on the department's computers. If you ask them whether they are on case management, they would not know what on earth you were talking about. They have not seen any case managers or heard about case management. They have not been told that they are in case management, but the department's record system says they are in case management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether these charges by the union are true or not, but they are quite serious charges and they have not been answered by the minister or by others who have spoken on behalf of the government. A very large piece of legislation is being introduced in a way which is quite unsatisfactory and making all sorts of commitments and promises which seem to be much more closely related to the political interests of the government than to helping young people in this country. </PARA>

Young people will become eligible for case management 13 weeks after registering as unemployed. Young persons at high risk will be provided with earlier case management. Secondly, the youth training initiative provides a labour market or vocational training program placement for young people who remain unemployed six months after registering for unemployment. Thirdly, it provides new income support arrangements to encourage young people to undertake approved education training or jobsearch activities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that this nation needs to acknowledge the dramatic changes which have taken place in the Australian labour market over the last 30 years. As I am sure you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, 30 years ago low skilled jobs were readily available, and probably both you and I in our own lives took advantage of them. Getting work as a teenager was the norm, and few people expected to retrain during their working lives. In fact, in the mid-1960s nearly 60 per cent of 15- or 19-year-olds had full-time jobs, and under a quarter completed full-time secondary education. Today, less than 20 per cent of teenagers hold a full-time job, but 75 per cent now complete secondary school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to recognise that we will never return to the world of 30 years ago, where large numbers of jobs were available for unskilled young workers. Today, half the number of people who are unemployed are under the age of 30. Australia's high rate of youth unemployment reflects the fact that we have one of the highest rates of labour force participation in the OECD. Conversely, we have one of the lowest rates of participation in apprenticeships and in secondary school vocational education. It is an area of secondary school level vocational education and the time spent before that in primary school that I would like to address more fully. </PARA>

There is no doubt that those young people who drop out will be disadvantaged throughout their lives, facing much longer periods and much higher rates of unemployment. Working Nation states that young people are much more likely to come from lower socio-economic backgrounds, have a disability, be an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander or homeless. Unfortunately, it omits the most important factor: the success or otherwise of schooling at the primary school level. To Working Nation's credit, it states that we need to act now to stop the cycle of disadvantage continuing and building, but it does not state when or where we should start. </PARA>

It states that the most significant determinant of future success is the quality of education received between the ages of seven and 11, and that schooling was a more significant factor in the determinant of future success than socioeconomic background, gender, race or religion. </PARA>

The question that needs to be asked is: why has similar research not been conducted in this country? As all members of this House are aware, it is state governments which are primarily responsible for the schooling of 5- to 15-year-olds. It is the failure of state government education policies that contribute more than any other factor to the 14 per cent of young people who leave school early. </PARA>

Children know; they do not need someone to tell them.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very uncivilised society that does not care for its young. Children, when they first go to school, are generally pretty excited and full of hope. Certainly, the odd one is tearful, but often a sympathetic and caring teacher can overcome that, and usually very quickly. But the child who fails to grasp early literacy and numeracy skills is at risk as early as six years of age when the symbols placed in front of him or her make no sense and there is no specialist teacher available to deal with that problem with an appropriate program such as `reading recovery' or `first steps'. A child is at risk in large classes when, because of lack of social skill, a disability or a difference, the child is ostracised by others and does not have the counselling skills available to him or her to learn the strategies to overcome and resolve those conflicts. </PARA>

I am not asking to go back to the technical schools of the 1950s and 1960s, even though they were a superior form of education. But certainly we need technological and operative skills in the context of 1994 leading on to the next century. There is no doubt that one way of encouraging young people to stay at school is to make sure that the school curriculum is flexible enough to meet the needs of each individual and that all young people, no matter what courses they follow, acquire the key competencies which are needed for work and life. </PARA>

Such young people very quickly learn that they cannot fit in, and life at school becomes a misery. That is exacerbated if they come from a low socioeconomic base, are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders, have disabilities or are homeless. They do not just leave school; they run away. They hide, and they vent their anger at great cost to society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remain quite convinced that, for the great majority of this group, this is all preventable. It is to our shame as a nation that we have so long ignored the needs of our forgotten people: children aged from five to 15 years. This bill deals with the consequences of that negligence for young people who have failed at their first chance of schooling, in primary schools, and at their second chance of schooling, in secondary school. It provides a third chance to participate in education and training, this time with desperately needed individual case management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge the member for Goldstein for approving case management and individual attention, because perhaps the basic goal of all education is the impact of mind on mind. It is not necessarily the technology. It is that personal relationship, as well as the building of trust into that personal relationship, that gives the confidence to explore all the options that are available. How much more productive, efficient and cheaper for the taxpayer would it have been, and how much less damage would have occurred, if that early school leaver had had a remedy by way of a specialist teacher, a counsellor or a case manager when he or she was six years of age and, probably, first exhibited the signs of the learning or social difficulty he or she developed at a later age?</PARA>

The next generation of young people going through our schools, if success is to be measured, should not need 50,000 places.

In response to the comment about the state governments, I remind the House that, if my recollection is correct, during the period of the Whitlam government we actually doubled in real terms the amount of per capita spending on education, yet from that period on we seem to have got into more and more trouble with unemployment.

I understand that there is a need for restraint in government expenditure but, when we consider the billions of dollars that are going into programs such as this and into the tertiary sector, $57 million in 1991-92 terms to allow the people of the regions to have reasonable access to Austudy seems a small price to pay. </PARA>

On past experience, it is extremely difficult to qualify the remote area allowance or isolated children's schemes. This is one of my main areas of concern with youth unemployment and education.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to be able to speak on the legislation before the House because it plays such a very important role in bringing to fruition some of our government's aims for helping our youth, as outlined in our Working Nation document. I have to say that, contrary to the negative attitude that has been displayed by the opposition, our government at least is prepared to put its money where its mouth is. It has implemented and continues to implement programs and policies which will achieve a fairer and more equitable society. It is a government which directs energies in a very positive manner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Student Assistance (Youth Training Allowance) Amendment Bill changes the name of the Student Assistance Act 1973 to the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973 and provides for the payment of youth training allowance instead of jobsearch allowance to young unemployed people under the age of 18 years. As part of our federal government's $660 million white paper youth training initiative, the youth training allowance is an income support measure for unemployed people under the age of 18 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Student Assistance (Youth Training Allowance&mdash;Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill complements the Student Assistance (Youth Training Allowance) Amendment Bill 1994, referred to as the YTA legislation, and enacts saving provisions and transitional provisions. It also makes amendments to a number of provisions of other acts which deal with jobsearch allowance and, of course, our Social Security Act 1991. It does that so that uniformity is achieved in all aspects in portfolios dealing with youth unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While our Department of Social Security will remain the paying agency for jobsearch and youth training allowance, the Department of Employment, Education and Training will have responsibility for YTA. This is in line with the idea of placing more emphasis than previously on the integration of income support and processes which lead to employment or employment related outcomes. DEET will have responsibility for program delivery and for the labour market program placements. In my view, this is a very logical move. Combining these elements demonstrates the government's commitment to enhancing cooperation between portfolios and ensuring improvements in knowledge of each other's responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this legislation some changes will occur to student assistant schemes, such as the implementation of safeguards for information about student assistance clients, the repeal of the requirement for an annual report on the act, as this duplicates the department's annual report, and moves to have student assistance appeals heard by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The YTA aims to ensure access to education, training or work for all young people and to equip them to compete effectively in our labour market. It also provides for access to comprehensive specific case management and vocational training programs. Realistically, it endeavours to reinforce for young people that sound education and training are pivotal to a successful career path and the need to implement early action to prevent young unemployed from entering the ranks of the long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Specifically, providing over 50,000 places annually to 15- to 17-year-olds will significantly increase the number of commencements in labour market programs for that specific group. The bill's transitional provisions provide appropriate treatment of claims for a jobsearch allowance made by people under the age of 18 years and will have a date of commencement before the commencement of the YTA legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Youth training allowance will align benefits for unemployed young people more closely with Austudy, encompassing a rate for unemployed young people who do not qualify as independent but need to live away from home to seek employment or undertake suitable training, subject to CES certification. Some of the benefits of the YTA are that there will be flexibility of rates, YTA clients will qualify for a health care card, and the fortnightly rate of the YTA may be increased by various allowances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obtaining meaningful employment has always been a key concern to young Australians. Increasingly, youth unemployment is a major concern to the whole community and indeed to our government. There is no doubt that Australians place enormous priority on all facets of their children's welfare, development and particularly their future prospects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1990 ANOP youth survey found that the main issues of concern to our young people in the 15- to 20-year-old age group were money, education and jobs. Expressions of concern about future employment and financial circumstances featured strongly. The issues confronting youth today&mdash;completing their education, training, gaining employment and economic independence, forming their own living arrangements and social relationships&mdash;are being faced in a time of considerable structural change to Australia's economic base. This has been compounded by the worldwide economic downturn of recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is fair to say that, to some considerable extent, high levels of youth unemployment are the result of technological and structural changes within our economy. Simply, entry level training for many of our youth has declined with technological advances. Irrespective of our politics, we all know that many jobs have disappeared. As the former New South Wales Premier, Nick Greiner&mdash;and I do not often quote him in this House&mdash;put it when he launched the 1991 New South Wales government youth policy, the problem is not youth but the rapid changes in society, particularly in technology and in the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many jobs which in the past provided entry to the work force for our youth have gone. White-collar and clerical work for youth has declined. For example, between 1966 and 1986&mdash;the period of the figures which I have available to me&mdash;the number of typing positions has been estimated to have fallen by some 28 per cent, clerical positions by 38 per cent, telephonists positions by 66 per cent and postal workers positions by nearly 70 per cent. Full-time teenage employment has fallen in skilled occupations such as nursing, drafting, electrical work and printing. Additionally, higher entry qualifications have closed off work options in banks and in the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The declining share of full-time employment and the increasing economic dependency of young people over the past 20 years have been recognised in federal government policies. The government has encouraged participation in further education and has targeted its assistance measures accordingly. Certainly, the majority of Australian young people are obtaining higher education levels and more skills than young people of previous generations. Many of them take part-time jobs while in school and further education to supplement their slower moves towards economic independence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A 1993 study from the research group in the Parliamentary Library shows that of most concern to social researchers and youth workers are the 10 to 15 per cent of young people who are estimated to be falling out of the net of mainstream education, training and work opportunities. This is the group who are most likely to be forced to leave their parents' home early, who are most likely to leave school, who are most likely to have limited employment skills and who are certainly most likely to be living in poverty on the streets. That group is of concern to our federal government. That is why the government introduces policies to assist young people in every possible way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as fast as we introduce positive measures to help our youth, we seem to have the opposition taking a contrary stance. Consider the Liberal Kennett government in Victoria. Over the past two years, the Kennett government has continued its demolition, which has seen over 230 schools closed, 8,000 teachers forced out of the state system and a further 1,000 made redundant. In fact, the federal government's share of the funding to the Victorian education system has been increased substantially since 1992, as the Kennett government has progressively reduced its own spending. In my own home state, New South Wales, the Liberal coalition government has sacked 2,500 teachers since 1988. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the federal government will persevere with those policies which are achieving results. Since 1983, the federal Labor government has embarked on unprecedented reform programs to improve Australia's education and training systems, to enhance our society and culture, and to provide a work force which is highly skilled, productive and internationally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Work has been under way on the consistency and quality of school curricula between states and territories in many core subject areas.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nation's literacy and language skills improvement programs have been, I am pleased to say, implemented. We are very proud of our retention rates, which have increased remarkably. For example, when Labor came to office in 1983, only four out of 10 people were staying on at school until year 12. That figure is now eight out of 10. Importantly, improvements in educational systems have been accompanied by new and dynamic approaches in the training area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Central to the federal government's programs is the idea of increasing opportunities for everyone, particularly those at the bottom of the socioeconomic scale. Recent figures are gratifying. Economic growth is strong. Consumer and business confidence levels are high. There is improved international competitiveness, less time is lost through industrial disputes these days and, of course, inflation is at an all-time low. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest industry survey has also shown a continuing pick-up in recovery in the important metal and engineering industry, with production at a five-year high and investment set to jump. According to the Metal Trades Industry Association, three out of five firms now in the industry have reported busy trading conditions in the three months to September of this year. Almost 40 per cent of the 290 firms surveyed have increased their work forces. About 30 per cent have reported higher exports, with further gains expected within coming months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> These good news stories are a by-product of our government's policies. In the final analysis, what we have achieved is real. The achievements of our Labor government since 1983, in difficult times, have given us a healthy economic base on which to build for the future. Certainly, in the International Year of the Family, the federal government recognises the importance of providing for youth and constantly displays willingness to participate in innovative ventures that will produce positive results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the federal government has endorsed a proposal from the Australian Football League for the establishment of a six-year sports traineeship program for something like 1,200 unemployed young Australians is just one example. This sports traineeship program, based on federal government funding and support, is a major initiative for Australian football. It will provide an excellent opportunity to develop a national program with all of our clubs and to give young people the chance of developing specific skills to assist their ultimate entry to the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement with the AFL can serve as a model for establishing traineeships in other sporting codes. Discussions are already under way, I gather, with a number of major sporting organisations. AFL traineeships will teach our young people useful, marketable and portable skills by offering training in sports administration, umpiring, ground keeping, coaching and catering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a national program&mdash;with trainees available to all clubs in the national league, including Sydney, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide, and country players&mdash;its potential is obvious. As well, a formal curriculum, comprising a range of accredited training modules, will result in trainees receiving a portable qualification under the Australian vocational certificate training system following the successful completion of that traineeship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other programs, illustrating clearly the government's commitment to getting young people into jobs, will of course include our $700,000 federal funding package to improve the national coordination of youth programs and services. Called the youth strategy action grants program, this program will fund 15 projects nationally, in cooperation with state and territory governments. Focusing on the needy, special attention is to be paid to young people who are currently unemployed, homeless or living in the more remote areas. YSA programs include strategies aimed at improving coordination of case management for our young people, assisting non-government bodies to improve financial and management skills and developing innovative strategies to assist young offenders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the federal Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) has recently commenced discussions with the National Farmers Federation on a package of rural traineeships specifically designed to help our drought ravaged farmers. In launching a green jobs report commissioned by the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and DEET, the federal minister noted that by the year 2000 we can expect as many as 700,000 jobs in environment industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrast such lateral thinking and involvement in positive ventures with the approach of the opposition. What does the opposition stand for? Looking at their paper, The Things That Matter&mdash;hardly an inspiring name, you would have to admit&mdash;I notice that it is full of motherhood statements. What does the document say? Nothing substantial, and certainly nothing specific. It says, `Young people should be able to look to the future with hope and optimism.' But what does this mean? The document says the coalition will provide young people with genuine employment opportunities and give our youth the basic skills needed to find employment. But the coalition does not provide any substance or specific outline for its policies or intentions. Its paper is merely a set of cliches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal Labor government has the runs on the board. Since it was re-elected in March 1993, 413,900 new jobs have been created. Figures now show that 31,000 long-term unemployed people have been helped under the federal government's job compact in its first three months of operation. Interestingly, these figures have been disputed by the coalition, which claims that the white paper measures have failed. What have we really received from the opposition? Zilch! But there has been strong support from many quarters for the government's ideas for nationally recognised vocational skill based competencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Views from the union movement, youth organisations and the community generally are that, while the young may be viewed as trainees rather than workers, their pay should be based on their level of competence. That is where the federal government policies are assisting our young unskilled people. Training is being provided, and improvements in educational systems have been accompanied by new and dynamic approaches in the training area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the government has implemented plans for long-term systemic change, it has also modified existing programs. Vocational training has been high on the government's agenda. Substantial funds have been provided for the establishment and expansion of a national system of vocational education and training with the establishment, of course, of our Australian National Training Authority. We have also substantially increased spending on TAFE. We are now on a path of strong sustainable growth, because we have implemented a comprehensive and intensive program of economic reform, concentrating on many sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, employment has increased by 3.8 per cent since April of 1993. That represents 286,000 new jobs in only 1 1/4 years. At that rate, we will easily have exceeded our election target of 500,000 extra jobs in this term of office. Our federal Labor government acknowledges that unemployment still needs to be addressed. The government's introduction of a training wage, allowing businesses to employ more people and train them to acquire appropriate skills, will help meet the needs of the modern Australian economy. It will also help people, particularly our young people, get the skills they need to enter and to stay in the work force. Our training wage contrasts sharply with that punitive, slave-labour youth wage that was originally put forward by the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With a highly educated, skilled and motivated work force, Australia can take its place as a leading player within the world community. Australia is enjoying a strong economic recovery which is well based, thus giving Australia the real prospects of achieving a strong economic performance for the rest of this century. I am very pleased with the bill before the House, and I am particularly pleased that it forms such a vital part of the program of implementing what we, as a government, see as vital structures for the youth of tomorrow. I commend the minister on the bill, and I am pleased to support it here in the House today. </PARA>

The package brought down in August was a classic example. The minister's best statement at her press conference was, `I'm terribly sorry that this is so difficult.' What the press forgot to ask was, `For whom, Minister&mdash;for you or for us?' On that occasion all we heard was a PR blurb about how this package was supposed to slow down the rate of decline in private health insurance. It will fail on every count, as we have seen in the last two days when the government's own health fund, Medibank Private, in Victoria put out a press release saying that 750,000 Victorians will benefit by cuts to their premiums when in fact one-quarter of Medibank's membership had a premium rise. </PARA>

<PARA>Remember that the explanatory memorandum said there would be no impact. Here is a statement from Minister Lawrence to another minister saying that the bill will result in an increase in overall costs to the budget of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Where is that disclosed? How much is the legislation going to impact upon it? We are supposed to have a government that is paying attention to the development of policy. Policy means that we get all the facts. It means that when we have a financial impact statement we want a financial impact statement. If the minister takes sufficient time out in her letter dealing with all the other bills that are to be addressed to say that she notes there will be an impact, why are we not told about it in the parliament?</PARA>

Apply it to yourselves, because you are in government. We are not the government in exile. We are offering another way. Again and again I have sat in Senate estimates committees and questioned bureaucrats who had been forced to abuse their function by doing party political work in analysing statements that had been made by the opposition. Allegedly they were doing this work for the benefit of government but in fact it was for a party political purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not be a party to encouraging that sort of behaviour in the Public Service.

I will not be party to making their lives more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I want to make here today is that the government is obliged to give us particular details with regard to expenditure that is being incurred, not global statements that it is all going to be okay, and to tell us where the money is coming from. Again and again I say that we have a financial crisis in health. We have a crisis because the private sector is collapsing slowly but surely because of the people leaving private health insurance. For every one per cent of people who leave private health insurance, the government has to find another $100 million. Where is the minister to find that money?

The consequential amendments have much more to do with the introduction into the national system of a new terminology and a new classification which need to be accommodated in all systems. People who were previously accommodated under the jobsearch allowance need to be accommodated under the youth training allowance. It is that consequential amendment, obviously, which this debate is about. There may be a cost to it, but the cost obviously will be inconsequential.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes in world technology, in world skills and in world trade are sufficiently profound to have been reflected deeply in our society. We were one of the slower countries to respond, if one looks back to the 1970s, in the education and training of our youth. In the early 1980s Australia was lagging well behind the Western world in school retention ratios and in the options, directions and diversity available to our talented young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in that context that a set of rapid changes have taken place, and we are trying to adapt and position ourselves in that context. People no longer will go from school to work, which was certainly the tradition for the majority of people when I grew up&mdash;and, I think, for most members. The minority went into training of some form, whether it was university, a trade or whatever. The fact was that most people went from school to a job. With this legislation, that may never occur again. It could still happen, technically, but the desirable way is for people to go from school to training of some sort and then to work. That will ensure that every person is given the opportunity and support to develop his or her skills to the greatest possible degree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that way, the white paper signals a sea change in the conceptual relationship between school, work and the community. The idea that we no longer will pay unemployment benefits was changed back in 1985 or 1987 when we switched to the jobsearch allowance as a concept. That was, as it were, a halfway house. The full development now, which is clearly needed, is the youth training allowance. That, I think, has broad community support. In that context, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs, of which I am chairman, has been conducting an inquiry for quite some time now into aspects of youth homelessness. So my comments on this legislation and on this issue are primarily related to matters that have arisen in that context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of young people in our community who clearly do not have traditional family support, and they will be affected by this legislation. Some weeks back, the committee produced a discussion paper which particularly referred to the introduction of the youth training allowance and some of the concerns that have come through the inquiry process to the committee. We did that both to assist the government to focus on the issues and also for the community and agencies to respond. Those issues involve the differences, to some degree, between the youth training allowance and Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One needs to understand that there will still be two separate systems. Young people who are in training or are seeking work and young people who are still at school will be treated differently, managed by two different departments and under separate legislation. That, in itself, is understandable and I have no particular argument about that. But looking at it from the point of view of homelessness&mdash;for children who do not have traditional family support&mdash;it seemed to me that there needed to be uniformity and a lack of discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In discussions in recent weeks, it has become clear that the original position of the Department of Employment, Education and Training on the introduction of the youth training allowance was to have separate criteria defining homelessness for people who applied for the youth training allowance as contrasted with those who applied for Austudy. In recent weeks, the two departments have now been able to agree that there be one set of criteria. Whether people are at school or seeking work or in some form of training program, if they are homeless that is a separate issue. To them, the government should be acting as one&mdash;not as separate departments with separate rules. We have established now that there will be one set of criteria. I express my appreciation of departmental officers who have been responsive to that problem and of their negotiations with the Department of Social Security to establish that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, what happens after the legislation, with the application and the processes which are involved, is equally important. Having a separate set of criteria is a vital first step. It is an extremely important signal to those applying. But there is not much point in having a single set of criteria if the processes are grossly different. What we suggested in the discussion paper, which followed the hearings we have been having and discussions which include the department, was that young persons presenting at Social Security, DEET, a CES office or a youth access centre would be treated equally whether they were applying for Austudy or the youth training allowance. That appears to be where we are going, and the interchangeability of the two departments is apparently developing also. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, with the processes used by the departments in assessing and determining the methodologies&mdash;the use of social workers and even the forms that are filled in&mdash;it is extremely important that we do not give a signal to young people at school that it would be simpler and easier to get an allowance for homelessness if they were not at school. That is the case right now and it has been the case for some time. Our feedback from the inquiry has certainly been of concern, which is why that matter has been raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I urge the department, as it moves to the implementation of the legislation, to build on what it has achieved so far. The single set of criteria is a major step forward, but it will not be fully effective unless the processes it incorporates are uniform. The idea is that a person simply approaches DEET or Social Security and is treated without discrimination. Therefore, in those towns or areas where there is either a DEET office or a Social Security office&mdash;but not both&mdash;people can apply for the youth training allowance or Austudy at either office and be treated the same throughout Australia. That will be a major step forward, and I am delighted about it, for a group of people who are greatly disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In giving honourable members some of the background to the inquiry I do not wish to pre-empt either my views or the travels and conclusions of the committee. But I point out that, in our investigations and inspections to date, we have talked to a number of young people, and many of the stories we have heard have been both tragic and disturbing. Certainly, the idea that the government makes life more difficult and more confusing for people who have been so severely traumatised is one that I am sure all members of this House would not support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue we raise in the discussion paper that has been picked up and incorporated in the legislation is the question of appeals relating to homelessness. At the moment the appeal process is through the Student Assistance Review Tribunal and we have raised some concerns about that. The decision to use the Social Security Appeals Tribunal for all appeals&mdash;for the youth training allowance and for Austudy&mdash;is another step forward. There will now be the same appeal process relating to homelessness for both Austudy and the youth training allowance. Whilst such a procedure has some complications in terms of some of the issues that may be dealt with, the composition of the tribunal and how it will take on the expanded role, it means that again we&mdash;the government and the community&mdash;present one face to our disadvantaged young people. I express appreciation that the department has been responsive to the need for a uniform process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be having some more hearings in outlying areas and talking to people who are living in remote areas in difficult family circumstances, where the nearest offices are a long way away, where the processes are forbidding, and where there is a lack of funds. To be truly equal in our treatment of people, we really have to find ways to get services out to the smaller towns. That is a challenge that has yet to be truly faced up to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter that comes up quite commonly in our hearings and that we have raised in the discussion paper is case management. I want to refer to a danger that I perceive. New methods are found and new ideas come forward: they are good, exciting and constructive, and they blossom. We have new terminology, a phrase such as `case management', which is an excellent phrase, but as we talk to different departments and different organisations in the non-government sector, we find it actually means quite different things to different people, and there is a danger that we diminish the potential by definition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the discussion paper, we have documented the possibility of five or six different people being involved in the case management of one person. Obviously, that can come up. However, we need to look very carefully at the methodologies of having key workers or having someone who acts as the prime worker. Homeless young people, in particular, have different kinds of problems. Their main concern is stability in terms of where they live. Once that is established, their prime need may change, and then the key worker may also change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a real danger that that will create a system of ownership, whereby an agency or an organisation or a department will feel responsible for a young person whom it has helped through a major crisis. The young person may need to move on in order to evolve, but will be held back by that case management structure. We need to think through case management very carefully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern is that, to date, the evidence on communication between Commonwealth departments has not been good. I have had strong reservations about that, although in recent months DSS-DEET discussions and negotiations on criteria have certainly been very welcome. The potential for the Commonwealth to improve its performance in terms of coordination is great. It could do a great deal better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can also do much better in terms of communication between the Commonwealth and the states, especially in the context of protocols. In supporting young people there are great gaps in terms of the definitions of, understanding about, application of and access to services. One finds when reading the submissions from state governments and talking to people active in the community and to young people themselves, that there appears to be a gap between the rhetoric and the performance. That is of concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth has displayed excellent leadership to date in terms of establishing protocols but, frankly, the Commonwealth protocols have some distance to go. According to young people, governments&mdash;both state and federal&mdash;do not go far enough in providing coordinated support. We and our state colleagues need to recognise that the more the departments are territorial, the more disputes seem to happen, and those intergovernmental disputes do enormous damage to young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lives of young people from traumatised backgrounds have been difficult enough. They are traumatised enough without then having to face conflict between governments, departments and agencies. So the question of case management, and Commonwealth relations and protocols, and state relations and protocols, is still a fairly profound issue. However, I am optimistic. I am urging the ministers and departments to look forward. Having established a better relation between DEET and DSS in terms of the common set of criteria, having recognised the need for change to the appeal process, and having recognised the need for common processes and the linking of the protocols between the two Commonwealth departments, we can now extend that platform into a much more uniform approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned about the lack of national coordination. That has occurred partly because of the confusion and uncertainty about the roles of the various departments. This legislation will clarify that area. The jobsearch allowance was almost a holding device, an interim measure. Although it was not recognised at the time, it can now be seen as such. The youth training allowance and this legislation will give a very clear definition of responsibility. It will make it much easier to coordinate them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of youth homelessness has been divisive. The community and, I am sure, my colleagues in this place are concerned about it. Youth homelessness will not be solved by divisive rhetoric. It will not be solved by manipulation of data. However, it could be solved if governments and parliaments could present a unified approach. I had hoped that this legislation would have brought about a fair degree of unanimity, and that is why I was disappointed that the member for Mackellar was at pains not only not to support the legislation but also not even to oppose it. She spoke on something entirely different. I found it quite amusing that she questioned bureaucrats who abuse their functions. I thought that she abused bureaucrats who questioned her functions. If she gets her phraseology right, she may be more accurate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She was saying that what the opposition is doing is offering another way. If there were another way to solve some of these problems about youth homelessness or about the youth training allowance, I would have liked to have heard it from her. If this is the wrong way to go, we should be talking about that now. My disappointment with the opposition in that context is because I had thought the community discussions and feedback that we have had since we started the inquiry, particularly since the white paper came out, had shown a high level of agreement about the direction of the youth training allowance and the youth training initiative, but with a number of queries about the application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With legislation with a single set of criteria, with changes to appeals processes and so on, we have got the base direction right and the platform right. I now very strongly urge the minister and departments to try to get the processes right, because there is not much point having a single set of criteria if we apply the processes in entirely different ways. There is not much point in young people coming to Social Security and having a conversation with a social worker on a face to face basis who helps understand the trauma and clarifies what has gone on in their lives and what is real and what is important to them, and on the other hand going to another department and having to have six statutory declarations, a whole lot of paperwork and a very long form done, and then wait three weeks for an interview with somebody. That is a very different process. That is what happens now with the current system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am confident that, with the changes caused by the youth training allowance, we can in fact get to a single seamless and transparent system where young people who have been through distressing family circumstances can approach the government for support to continue in education, to continue in training, and be treated the same, regardless of the town they live in, regardless of which department they approach. I think those objectives are broadly agreed across the community, and they are very achievable. This legislation is the first step in that, and I therefore support it in the House. </PARA>

<PARA>The planned sale of Aerospace Technologies of Australia Ltd&mdash;ASTA&mdash;is a unique step in the government's micro-economic reform program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process of reform in this case commenced in 1986 when the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) as the then Minister for Defence approved the formation of ASTA under the then Companies Code. This started the transition of the Government Aircraft Factories&mdash;GAF&mdash;from an organisation with a narrow defence focus to an internationally competitive company whose prime interest is in the civil aerospace industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ASTA's productivity improvements have been brought about largely by improved work practices and in this regard the government would like to acknowledge the commitment of the employees of the company in this transition and the initiative of the new management for its vision and implementation of these important changes. ASTA has long-term contracts to manufacture important components for the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group and Aerospatiale, a member of the Airbus Consortium. It also has a long-term relationship with the McDonnell Douglas Corporation through the FA18 aircraft program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The quality of the work carried out by ASTA has been recognised in two ways. Firstly, through ASTA winning awards from the world's prime aerospace companies, such as the President's Award for Excellence from Boeing and by achieving the McDonnell Douglas `silver' preferred supplier status. Secondly, by being the sole worldwide manufacturer of specific key components for both of these companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be recognised that ASTA operates in industries that have shown distinct cycles of activity. Both the airline industry and the aerospace industry have been in a trough which has slowed orders for the components that ASTA manufactures and that has seen demand for heavy aircraft maintenance decline as airlines defer this type of work. As these industries come out of the trough there should be significant opportunities for ASTA and its new owner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ASTA currently has an order from the UK Ministry of Defence for 18 Jindivik unmanned jet aircraft&mdash;an aircraft originally designed by ASTA's predecessor, the Government Aircraft Factories. ASTA will work with the preferred tenderer, E-Systems, in the refurbishment of the RAAF's fleet of P3C Orion maritime surveillance and anti-submarine aircraft. This is a long-term project that will bring additional work to ASTA at Avalon and employment to the Geelong region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the formation of ASTA, the company has established a major subsidiary at Avalon, Victoria. ASTA Aircraft Services Pty Ltd&mdash;ASTAAS&mdash;was formed in 1988 to conduct major maintenance of wide-bodied civil aircraft, such as the Boeing 747. However, heavy maintenance is a demanding industry which is highly competitive. There are significant challenges ahead for ASTAAS as it seeks to capture work emerging from any growth in the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government wishes to sell all the Commonwealth's equity in ASTA. Its preference is to maintain ASTA in majority Australian ownership. It wishes to find a buyer, or buyers, able to demonstrate a capacity to provide synergistic benefits to ASTA and able to commit to the ongoing development of a strong, export oriented, domestic aerospace industry. Passage of this bill will provide certainty for both current employees of ASTA and for bidders in relation to a number of issues that are important in the sale process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main purpose of the bill is to ensure that existing Commonwealth legislation applying to ASTA because of its status as a Commonwealth owned entity will cease to apply to ASTA from the sale day. After the sale, ASTA will not, as far as practicable, be subject to Commonwealth legislation which does not govern the activities of private sector companies. In addition, there are saving provisions to preserve certain pre-sale rights or obligations, for example in relation to the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983 for acts or omissions that occurred before the sale day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes provision for a separate sale of a subsidiary before the sale of the company itself should this be necessary to achieve the objectives of the sale. Employee entitlements, such as long service leave and maternity leave, are covered by awards and enterprise agreements that apply to ASTA and ASTA Aircraft Services Pty Ltd. As with any change of ownership these agreements will continue after the sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major part of the bill applies to superannuation arrangements to ensure that no employee is disadvantaged by the sale if they are relying on service with ASTA to qualify for deferred superannuation benefits. After the sale day, the service of employees of ASTA or its subsidiaries, even if sold separately, will continue to be recognised as public employment for the purposes of qualifying for certain deferred superannuation benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those employees who transferred to ASTA from the Government Aircraft Factories in 1987 and 1988, the right to apply for jobs in the Commonwealth Public Service as an alternative to taking a redundancy package will cease from the sale day. This is standard practice applied to all government business enterprises when they move into private sector ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes a consequential amendment to the Commonwealth Borrowing Levy Act 1987 so that no levy will be imposed on ASTA's borrowings after the ASTA sale day. The primary financial impacts of the sale of ASTA will be the offset to outlays occurring when the sale receipts are credited to the Commonwealth public account and the return of any surplus in the Commonwealth superannuation scheme additional contributions trust fund to the consolidated revenue fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to employees, no further employer contributions will be received by the Commonwealth from ASTA in relation to those employees who are currently members of the Commonwealth superannuation scheme. It should be noted that employee superannuation contributions are classified as financing transactions and do not affect the budget outcome. In addition, the cost of monitoring ASTA currently met by the portfolio department, the Department of Defence, and the Department of Finance will cease following the sale and the need for any future call on the Commonwealth, such as for capital, will be eliminated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill puts in place the necessary legislative framework to enable the sale of ASTA to be completed once an acceptable sale agreement has been agreed. It will remove ASTA from the remaining Commonwealth accountability arrangements other than those of a normal company and allow the company to develop with a new owner committed to ensuring that ASTA continues to play an important role in the Australian aerospace industry. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is worth recalling that, although the government has lately been selling its assets, it decried the sale of government assets when I raised the matter of privatisation in the late 1980s. In the book that I put out at the time entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Privatisation&mdash;the Australian Way</EMPHASIS> I outlined a series of companies, corporations and government instrumentalities. Today I think there are only three left that have not been got at but, at the time the book was brought out, the notion was decried as something that could not be done. Yet today, in six minutes, bang go the old Government Aircraft Factories. So we have certainly gone a long way in terms of debate within the Labor Party. We heard all about what was going to happen in Hobart with privatisation, how the Left was going to line up and resist but, this afternoon, in six minutes, away goes privatisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has to be some significance in this. The cabinet minute in relation to the decision on ASTA is quite interesting with regard to how things have changed. Firstly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The value of ASTA was unlikely to increase significantly if retained in Government ownership for a further period.</PARA>
<PARA>Secondly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further returns to the Commonwealth were unlikely to be great, given the depressed state of ASTA's markets and the company's resultant marginal viability.</PARA>
<PARA>That is not bad. So the government accepted that the company in its hands had no future, according to the record of the cabinet's decision. So then the government put out a rosy press release saying that all was well but it planned to sell the company and called for expressions of interest by putting an ad in the paper. The other day we were told that two people were already lining up. I bet the government did not show them the minute on what the cabinet thought of the viability of the corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are supporters of the privatisation process and we take the view that this company, out of government hands, will have a future. We wish it well. The old government aircraft corporation had some remarkable successes but it did tot up a hell of a lot of losses over the years&mdash;at least $30 million. As a consequence of that the government, when it reorganised it in its current form, came along with some money to help out over that period. Those losses have been turned around in recent times to modest profits. But when we look at the annual accounts of the company we can see there have been some very significant changes in assets. Also, in its last financial period, the $28 million it got from the government by way of R&amp;D was probably its most significant inflow for the year in terms of making the whole show work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at this and at the people of some eminence that are on the board, I expect that they will be delighted to go to the private sector. Some might even retire. The burden of trying to pull the point around has been borne during a long, heavy haul. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth casting thought for a few moments on what goes on in the ALP in relation to privatisation. I have not seen any debate about this. There was a statement about a year ago by Senator Ray to announce the decision of the government to sell. There was not much else after that. It is obviously not an ALP icon, which has to be discussed. It is easily cast aside. The sale was not the subject of debate so far as I can recall. There are no national strikes, there are no backroom deals and there is no PAYE tax break such as we have seen applied to ANL in recent times to see if the government can get that one going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Task force B, which is running the sale of this company, happens to be the same task force as the one that was handling the proposed sale of ANL. So we go down the trail to see what the differences were. Here are corporations with the same task force handling the selling of them, but with different ministers. One was handled by Senator Ray and one is handled by that other well-known minister who seems to bungle everything&mdash;the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton)&mdash;and here we go again in relation to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to hold up the process at all, because we support privatisation and we wish this corporation well. It pays just to point out some of the benefits that flow from privatisation&mdash;efficiency and what we get out of the flow in that area. All GBEs have improved enormously in productivity and in terms of profitability from the moment of privatisation. Moreover, additional capital can be raised without the taxpayer putting it in, on the basis that it must stand to return on the moneys raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, we have employee participation. Employees in the company can own shares in it and by doing that can feel a genuine part of it, which is so important these days. Further, consumers benefit in terms of better product, better service and certainly better pricing. The company becomes more efficient and more responsive to service needs, and more conscious of market conditions and the potential price and product advantages that flow from that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the opposition, I welcome the privatisation of this company. I wish it well. In the past it has contributed to the defence of Australia and I am sure that it has a remarkably good future in the hands of the private sector.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The AeroSpace Technologies of Australia Limited Sales Bill 1994 gives effect to the government's announced intention to sell this company to the private sector. The bill and the sale complete a process which was begun in 1986 when then defence minister Beazley commenced the process of transforming the old Government Aircraft Factories from an entity with a fairly narrow defence focus into an internationally competitive company with great potential for growth in the civil aerospace industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill canvasses certain technical arrangements and matters relating to this sale, such as the commercial status of the entity after the sale, the limits to the Commonwealth financial responsibility once this sale is effected, the responsibilities and obligations of the management in the transition period, the safeguards that are being provided for employee entitlements, the protection of the status of current enterprise agreements and the matters relating to the superannuation of employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My position on the sale of this public asset in the Geelong region is well known. My opposition to the sale of ASTA at this particular point in time has been put in print in the Geelong area. I will canvass some of the arguments that I have advanced in my local community in support of that particular point of view. I do so acknowledging that the ultimate responsibility for this matter lies with the executive of the government, which made this decision some time ago. I am satisfied with the assurances given to me and to this House by the minister in charge of this sale, the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), that the workers in this enterprise will be protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not convinced that the issue of the sale of assets that are now in the hands of the Commonwealth has been fully understood or debated enough in the Australian community generally. That is a general proposition that I hold, because this is a very important area of public policy and one which I think deserves the greatest level and measure of debate within the government, the opposition and the community generally. I suppose we eternally face this argument about what the government should own, what it does own, whether what it owns is productive and whether it should be sold. As a general proposition, perhaps these issues have not been debated widely enough. I certainly hope that, over the next few years, there is a high level of debate on these issues in local communities, in state communities and, of course, at the federal level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the public statements that I have made, I encouraged the government to postpone the sale of this asset. ASTA and Avalon are of importance to the Geelong region. Avalon is situated outside the city of Geelong proper. As many members would know, the economy of Geelong is based mainly on some heavy manufacturing areas, on motor vehicle and component manufacture, on aluminium, on value-added production to wool, as well as on petrochemicals. ASTA represented to the Geelong community a very concerted attempt to diversify the economic base of the region and to introduce into manufacturing in the area a very highly skilled and high value-added area of production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Avalon facility itself is not just the airport and the aircraft maintenance services that are there at the moment. There are some 4,000 acres of land around this facility, and I will allude a little bit later to the plans that the community had&mdash;wider plans for the development of this area&mdash;which I hope proceed after this sale is effected. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I consider it very important for the Commonwealth to retain an important leverage over the development that would take place in the Avalon area. I consider that a very strong argument for the government to retain a significant interest in this area. Of course, there were fairly bald economic considerations. They relate to the fact that, although this particular enterprise has been going through some difficulty in recent times, it would&mdash;with the upturn in the aerospace industry and with the progressive ageing of the Boeing fleet&mdash;be positioned to take advantage of increased work. Over time, I guess that would lead it to greater levels of profitability, and it would be an asset of increasing value for the Commonwealth to sell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also have some concerns that, if the sale of this enterprise were to proceed, an overseas buyer who is not compatible with the overall plans of the community and the region for this area might run down the facility and might not take care of the interests of the skilled work force that we have built up over time. It is for all of those reasons that over time I have argued in the Geelong community the case for a fairly cautionary approach to the sale of this asset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I am very encouraged by several key statements in the second reading speech made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) on behalf of the Minister for Finance. Firstly, it was stated that the government wishes to sell its equity in ASTA. The government's preference, as expressed in the second reading speech, is to maintain majority Australian ownership in ASTA and to seek out buyers who are prepared to commit to an export oriented domestic aerospace industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those statements in the second reading speech are of some comfort to me, given the position that I have held on this issue in the past. Those statements will also be of considerable comfort to those workers at ASTA, who in the past have been concerned about their future not solely because of the prospect of privatisation but because of the general state of the aviation industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, this industry demands high levels of skill from its work force. It is a high value added industry which has significant export potential. Geelong has attempted to diversify its manufacturing base, and ASTA is a very important part of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The positive words about the ASTA labour force from the parliamentary secretary in the second reading speech give me some comfort. He acknowledged, on behalf of this Labor government, the contribution of those workers to workplace reform in this country. I must say that these workers can be very proud of their national contribution. The process of structural change in the economy and cultural change in the workplace is never an easy process. It is easy for the armchair theorists and it is easy for those who are not affected by the decisions that are made, but it is certainly not an easy process for the workers and their families who cope with change on a daily basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ASTA work force has much to be proud of at this point in time. It has embraced the cultural changes necessary to improve the productivity of this enterprise and place it in the situation of profitability it now enjoys. It has participated fully in the restructuring of the enterprise; it has changed its work practices; it has led the field in striking enterprise bargains at the workplace; it has constructed work teams that have seen massive improvements in profitability; and it has participated in very innovative processes of change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these things have been done against a background of uncertainty&mdash;internal uncertainty about the process of change and external uncertainty about the future of the industry. The recession in the industry has certainly added to that uncertainty. I pay tribute on the floor of the House to those workers in the ASTA facility, and in particular the unions that represented them, for managing this process of change, not without difficulty but exceptionally well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted in the second reading speech the positive signs that the minister and the parliamentary secretary alluded to for this particular facility. That ought to be a source of some comfort and give great heart to the workers at this facility. Over time we will see the world recession easing and the level of air activity increasing. This, coupled with the ageing of the Boeing fleet, should ensure the continued viability of facilities such as ASTA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government is able to manage a successful sale to a buyer that sees the skills that have been built up in ASTA as a springboard for future and ongoing development, the economic future of the workers in this facility will be secured. It has been a long haul for the workers of ASTA. They have poured a lot of time and effort into multiskilling themselves. They have poured an extremely large personal effort into bringing this particular enterprise into a state of profitability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government owes the workers of this facility much because, as I said before, they led Australia in workplace reform. They were held up to other enterprises throughout the nation as a model that should be followed to achieve the sorts of reforms that have now positioned Australia in such a very powerful position in the Asian region and in the world economy. Humble workers in a facility have played a very significant national role for the enterprises of this nation, and it is something of which they can be proud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many members opposite speak very strongly in this House about the union movement and criticise it heavily. They fail to recognise that at the end of the day unions represent working people. These are ordinary Australians, ordinary men and women, who have a right to upgrade their skills, a right to participate in employment in an enterprise such as this and a right to earn a decent living from the efforts they put into those enterprises. At the end of the day, when you strip all the rhetoric away from the position that the opposition puts before the Australian people, it really says in essence to the ASTA workers, `The only way that you will survive over time, and the only way that the Australian economy will survive over time, is if we see a diminution of your wages and a diminution of your working conditions.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take with a grain of salt the words uttered by the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) because at the moment a Liberal government in Victoria is proceeding with a privatisation program that is not well thought out, that is not well constructed, but is driven by ideologues that occupy some very powerful positions on the shadow front bench and in the formulation of coalition policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the parliamentary secretary and the minister for the concern they have shown for the workers in this facility. I hope there will be an ongoing dialogue with the unions in that facility so that at the end of the day, when this sale is effected and when the contribution of those workers is rightfully acknowledged, they will continue to take their place at the forefront of economic and workplace reform in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In support of the AeroSpace Technologies of Australia Limited Sale Bill, I firstly want to take a few minutes before question time to make some comments generally about Australia's aerospace industry and secondly want to mention two of the six elements of Aerospace Technologies of Australia&mdash;ASTA components and ASTA defence, in particular, to pick up what I think is the strategic importance of this facility to our nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that there is very little justification for the government remaining in an aircraft commercial activity. We commend the government for doing what the opposition in government would have done some years ago. The proposal was first foreshadowed in the budget in August 1993 and was supplemented by an announcement by the Minister for Defence, Senator Ray, in December last year. I say to the parliamentary secretary, who is at the table, that it is amazing to see the difference between the comments that were made by Senator Ray in December 1993 and some of the comments that were clearly reflected in the cabinet minute that came out of that meeting. That point is picked up in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> in a very interesting, albeit small, article. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of key issues are involved in this legislation. Both the parliamentary secretary, when introducing the legislation, and the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) have mentioned them. The first concerns the future of the 700-plus employees at ASTA. I do not intend to go into that matter. I think the honourable member for Corio has covered that, albeit with understandable parochial attitudes. The second issue relates to the future of Avalon airfield. Again, I do not intend to go into that today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will make some brief comments about the third issue which concerns foreign ownership levels. My understanding is that the government's preference is to have a majority Australian holding in that facility once it is sold. Up to a point, I agree with the honourable member for Corio. It is a strategic asset and I think it has to remain very firmly in the hands of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to a few comments made in the June 1989 edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aircraft</EMPHASIS> where it talked about the old Government Aircraft Factories and ASTA. The article stated in part:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the industry's throwaway lines is that Mr George Stuart and his executive force at Aerospace Technologies of Australia have performed one of the greatest come-backs since the resurrection of Lazarus.</PARA>
<PARA>An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> last year, entitled `Aircraft components industry adds value and wins exports', stated in part:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is not generally renowned as holding particular expertise in aerospace technologies; it appears to have no real natural advantage in the area and, given the seemingly massive investments involved in the industry, would be expected to be a very small world player.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look a bit closer, though, and the export growth prospects in aircraft components are almost assured to the end of the decade by significant long-term contracts&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which the parliamentary secretary referred to&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">held by the key players in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA>The article went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . ASTA turnaround is perhaps the most fascinating. When the group was formed in 1987 from the old Government Aircraft Technologies businesses, it was losing between $20 million and $40 million a year.</PARA>
<PARA>The article further stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ASTA's sales have grown steadily from $96.9 million in 1989 to $161 million last year, with exports rising from $48.2 million in 1989, about 50 per cent of sales, to $128.5 million last year, or 80 per cent of the sales total.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sales growth has also been profitable: from heavy losses in 1987, the business achieved a profit of $1.2 million in 1991, representing an $11 million profit from the components operations offset by start-up losses from the aircraft maintenance business.</PARA>
<PARA>An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aircraft</EMPHASIS> magazine in December last year made the very pointed comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the fact it has moved from a dog of a business losing $30 million a year at its formation to a profitable concern with apparent attractions for the sharemarket is quite remarkable in itself.</PARA>
<PARA>Australia's aerospace industry has emerged as a sophisticated supplier of technology, components and services to international markets. Aviation electronics, the manufacture of airframe components and the design of airport systems, air traffic control and space related projects are among the industry's export related activities. Work on the design, development and production of airliner components such as the giant rudder and elevator for the tail of the Boeing 777 spearheads a significant export drive. The industry, emerging from a period of restructuring, with a work force of about 12,000, has continued its strong export performance despite the global recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the manufacture of airframe components, export related activities include aeromaintenance, aviation electronics, the design of airport systems, air traffic control and air navigation equipment, the production of engine parts and mechanical equipment and a wide range of space related projects. Australia's advanced aerospace engineering, technological and education and training capability comes from a 50-year tradition of aircraft design, manufacture, assembly and maintenance, mainly to meet defence needs and also the needs of commercial airlines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia from 1970 had an offsets policy under which overseas companies selling aircraft to Australian customers were required to place local orders for up to 30 per cent of the value of the contract. Since 1991 the offsets policy has been succeeded by a policy of reaching understandings with the major aircraft makers to give Australian companies free and fair access to significant contracts. The aim has been to  integrate the Australian industry more fully with the world industry and to boost its international competitiveness. The move has encouraged Australia's two leading aerospace companies&mdash;one of which the legislation before us today is concerned with&mdash;to seek more business in making composite and aluminium components and subassemblies for large airliners under agreements with the prime aircraft makers that increasingly involve research and development commitments and financial risk sharing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Between them, the two companies, Hawker de Havilland and ASTA, now make subassemblies for most large international aircraft, including the Boeing 737, 747, 757 and 777, the Airbus 300, 310, 320, 330 and 340 and, as the parliamentary secretary indicated, for McDonnell Douglas in terms of the MD80, MD90 and more latterly the MD11. ASTA makes the 12-metre-long Boeing 777 rudder, one of the largest single-piece carbon fibre skin panels ever built. It also produces five components for the European Airbus group, including the main landing gear floor structure for both the Airbus 330 and 340 aircraft and the carbon fibre landing gear doors for the 340. Hawker de Havilland is involved similarly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aerospace industry in Australia is significant. I would like to say a bit about the strategic dimension to which I referred earlier. One has to go no further than the history of the government aircraft factory, now ASTA, and the large input that it made and has been making for about 50 years in producing aircraft, anti-submarine and anti-tank missiles and, as the parliamentary secretary said in his opening comments, in terms of the P3C Orion and the PC9 and others, being involved more latterly in their production and follow-on support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is a substantial industry economically and strategically. In regard to the foreign investment connotations, I commend the government to look very carefully as to what extent overseas interests would, if they are interested, be involved in such a strategic asset. That should be borne in mind in the sale process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the few minutes leading up to question time, I refer to one specific program and one specific aircraft involved with the former Government Aircraft Factories cum ASTA; that is, the Nomad. A number in this House have heard me over the last five or six years condemn that aircraft in terms of its safety record. We heard more about that yesterday during question time when the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) was questioned in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say nothing further on that at this stage, but I specifically refer the House to that tragic accident of March 1990 involving the fatality of a young air force officer. This  raises the tragedy of not only one air force officer being killed but also the wider connotations of big question marks over that particular aircraft. In terms of the strategic implications of ASTA and its sale, I think that is very important indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take the opportunity to remind the House of what I said last week in the context of that aircraft's safety involving not only the Minister for Transport&mdash;that minister should be condemned and remains condemned for the dereliction of his ministerial duties in the area of aviation; I am sure the opposition will have a bit more to say on that later on&mdash;but also the Minister for Defence. The minister has a lot to answer for in relation to that aircraft. I ask the minister once again to answer my questions relating to that particular aircraft, which I put down on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> some three or four months ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said last week, the Australian designed and built Nomad, which operates here and overseas, both in civilian register and defence roles, has had a chequered history of operational constraint, grounding, in-flight incident and, in the extreme, fatal accident in Australia and, unfortunately, overseas. In the latest fiasco&mdash;I referred to this in question time yesterday&mdash;I am informed that, arising from a major in-flight incident in the West Indies with a Nomad, remarkably like an incident with an RAAF aircraft at Tindal in the Northern Territory a few years ago, further bulletins have been issued by AeroSpace Technologies of Australia and others which impose additional operational constraints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat a number of the questions posed to the Minister for Transport yesterday in the context of that aircraft and its operations. Has he seen the ombudsman's report relating to that specific accident? Has he been briefed by CAA officials on the Adelaide accident? What has been its reaction to the ombudsman's criticisms? Are the minister and the Minister for Defence fully satisfied that the civil register Nomads and defence force Nomads are safe? Is the Minister for Transport going to ground the civilian register aircraft until all operational question marks are resolved or is he going to sit back as he did with the Aero Commander aircraft, similar to the one that crashed en route to Lord Howe Island? Finally, is the minister going to take appropriate action with the Minister for Defence and, I might add, overseas authorities? There are 50 or 60 aircraft flying overseas and there are international ramifications, so what are the ministers going to do to resolve the aircraft's obvious shortcomings? With those few words, I have much pleasure in supporting the legislation before the House. </PARA>

Prime Minister, four weeks ago you attacked barrackers for lower deficits, saying that savings from a lower deficit would just end up chasing real estate and property prices. Now that the barrackers for lower deficits include the Reserve Bank Governor, the Treasurer&mdash;who has been barracking for lower deficits all across the globe, from Madrid to Tokyo&mdash;and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, do you still stand by that statement or will you concede you were wrong and that the government's deficit reduction strategy must now be changed?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know I am. I intend to stay one, too. To me, it means that the medium-term deficit reduction strategy, which the government put into place for the first time on the publication of the One Nation statement in 1992, was aimed at showing that, as the recovery strengthened, the fiscal stimulus would be withdrawn. This is an entirely sensible and reasonable thing to do, and is an entirely natural thing to happen. As the economy improves, as the Commonwealth outlays on unemployment benefits are reduced, as the natural stabilising cost to the budget starts to recede and as the revenues from the economy start to pick up, then the budget balance changes. It comes back towards surplus. That is what is in the One Nation forecast. The government's target has been that the deficit would come in at around one per cent of GDP by 1996-97.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Fraser said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accelerated cuts in the budget deficit would not remove the need for official interest rates to rise further.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I haven't sort of posed that as an alternative to any further increase in interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA>He continued&mdash;and I want you to listen to this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wouldn't subscribe to the view that you could slash and burn on the budget side so that you can keep interest rates down so that people can run around and buy and invest and do anything they want to.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he was saying, `I am not subscribing to the view that you should massacre the outlay side of the Commonwealth budget simply to supposedly hold down interest rates and then let anyone do what they please with the savings.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The burden of your remarks in recent times has been that, unless the government reduces the budget deficit, there will be an attendant increase in interest rates, whereas the governor is making it quite clear that the role of monetary policy is basically to sustain the recovery, to smooth the recovery, and that monetary policy has a role to play in this cycle. That is not a message that burdens the government because the government used monetary policy in the last cycle over a period of eight or nine years, which I thought would demonstrate even to you that we know it is available as an instrument. Mr Fraser said also:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was no immediate pressure&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is on the budget&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">from either the CPI or the current account deficit on the current account at present.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know why the shadow Treasurer takes any comfort from Mr Fraser's remarks. Mr Fraser has made it very clear that he believes that interest rates and monetary policy have a role independent of the current account deficit and that, if one wants to make any impact on the current account deficit, that is a question of the savings balance in the nation and not some adjustment to fiscal policy for interest rates. Mr Fraser is basically saying that he thinks the recovery may be stronger than forecast; therefore, the deficit consolidation program needs to be faster. To this, I say that, if the growth is greater, the deficit reduction will automatically be faster.</PARA>

Did Mr Tozer's 1989 application for his initial four-year Australian  Creative Artists Fellowship state that the money would be used to develop such a centre for the arts? Was the Prime Minister extensively involved in renovations at the convent, supervising and paying contractors on Mr Tozer's behalf during 1991, as also reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Good Weekend</EMPHASIS> magazine? Did Mr Tozer, shortly before selling out of his disastrous project in November last year, receive a then unprecedented second five-year fellowship, taking the value of his back to back fellowships to $525,000? Is it the case that the first fellowship was squandered on your poor advice: if so, did this necessitate a second grant to bail out Mr Tozer? Is this an example of what is supposed to be&mdash;and I quote from your minister in the other place&mdash;`arms length peer review funding' under the creative fellowship scheme?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can understand the opposition not wanting to hear anything about the good story on the Australian economy. On various key criteria Australia looks very good when compared with industrialised countries generally. I might just mention a few of those. In relation to the GDP growth, our rate of growth of 4.3 per cent through the last financial year compares very well with the OECD average as a whole. It is over twice the OECD average rate of growth. It puts us at the top of the growth league.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's employment growth in the year to September of 3.9 per cent was far and above the OECD average, which was 0.9 per cent. We had 3.9 per cent so we are at the very top of the employment growth table in the OECD. Australia is in the low inflation league. Our rate has been below 2 1/2 per cent for the last three years. Our 1.7 per cent inflation rate over the last 12 months was well below the OECD average of 2.3 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the budget outcome, we see that our general government deficit of 2.8 per cent of GDP in 1993-94 was 1.4 per cent of GDP below the OECD average. So we are definitely in the league of the lower budget deficit countries. That OECD average of 4.2 per cent was made so low only by a surplus in Japan. Many other industrialised countries had quite large deficits, including the UK which had 7.7 per cent; Canada, 6.8 per cent; France, 5.8 per cent; Italy, 9.5 per cent; Spain, 7.2 per cent; and Sweden, an astonishing 12.9 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our performance in terms of a general government deficit outcome last year of 2.8 per cent of GDP obviously compares exceedingly well with that of most other industrialised countries. In terms of public sector debt, we are well below the average of OECD countries. Our net public debt&mdash;and this is all levels of government&mdash;last year was 24 per cent of GDP. That compares with an OECD average of 40 per cent. There are only three countries for whom we can get figures out of 16 OECD countries whose figures are lower than ours. You have some countries, like Italy and Belgium, with ratios of over 100 per cent. In terms of the size of our public sector and our tax burden, as we know, we are at the bottom of the league in terms of the tax burden. Apart from Turkey, we are the lowest taxed Western industrialised country. Our public sector, accordingly, is amongst the very lowest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia looks very good in every respect against these sorts of key criteria when one compares us with other industrialised countries. That, of course, makes us very attractive to foreign investors who are also impressed by the fact that our corporate profits are high; that our corporate tax regime is quite competitive with those of other countries; by our greatly improved industrial relations performance&mdash;which saw time lost in industrial disputes last year at only one-fifth of the average in the 1970s and the second lowest for any year since 1959&mdash;and by our structural reform program which, as this House is aware, is a very widespread program based on the unilateral tariff reduction program. The unilateral tariff reduction program in itself is unique in the world. As well there is the widespread reform in various service industries; improvements to the labour market; and our extraordinary export diversification, which has given us growth of manufacturing exports, elaborately transformed manufactures, of 16 per cent per annum since the mid-1980s, and service exports growing by nine per cent per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On every front, this record of performance by the Australian economy looks very good indeed. Of course, in terms of the balance of payments, the fact that we are diversifying our exports so rapidly, reducing commodities from 80 per cent of merchandise exports to 65 per cent in just the last eight years&mdash;a tremendous change&mdash;in itself shows that the country is directly addressing the problem with its balance of payments, the current account deficit, this long-term structural problem, and is pursuing the right policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One factor, however, which I think is very important for us to bear in mind for the future in terms of public policy formation is the fact that the rest of the world is clearly determined to grow in a low inflation environment. Everywhere I went, everyone I spoke to and heard speaking was talking about the need to grow with low inflation. So finance ministers, central bankers and everyone else who matters in that respect are talking about the need to grow with low inflation. That is very important for us because it means that countries everywhere are determined to keep their currently quite low inflation levels at relatively low levels whilst they have their economic recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is being reinforced by the Maastricht treaty, which has various convergence criteria for entrance to the European monetary union later in this decade. One of those criteria is low inflation. That treaty requires countries which are going to join the European monetary union to keep their inflation rate low&mdash;in fact, within 1 1/2 per cent of the average of the three best performers. That means there is an added discipline internationally for low inflation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For us, the important lesson to learn is that we have to keep inflation low as we continue to grow. The Reserve Bank has set a range of two to three per cent for underlying inflation&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Where problems affecting aviation safety and deficiencies in aviation safety regulation have been found, the government has acted quickly to address them. It is worth remembering that Australia's international and domestic passenger carriers continue to enjoy a worldwide reputation for rigorous safety standards. When the government announced changes in respect of the BASI recommendations, the questioner put a statement out in which he said that he:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>This is in July. The statement went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Sharp said that the measures announced by Mr Brereton were in accord with those Mr Sharp had called for in his speeches . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Now he tries to traffic on the back of a tragedy and come and represent himself as some sort of clairvoyant in all this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has agreed to a comprehensive reform strategy to strengthen air safety regulation in Australia by establishing a new independent aviation safety agency. We have increased the government funding contribution for all public interest regulation aspects of aviation safety by $29 1/2 million, and we have increased insurance cover for all passengers. As well as that, the government has agreed to a judicial inquiry to investigate the CAA's handling of Seaview Air checks and, as honourable members know, the inquiry is to be headed by Sir Laurence Street.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that, in an absolute orgy of press statements and unsubstantiated allegations, the member for Hume has put out statements suggesting that Airlink&mdash;a Qantas subsidiary&mdash;is in some way a safety risk. I note that in a statement put out yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Managing Director of Qantas, Mr James Strong, expressed amazement that the Shadow Minister for Transport, Mr John Sharp had made sensational claims about Airlink and (National Jet Systems) today without any attempt to consult with Airlink or National Jet Systems or Qantas on the accuracy or significance of the information.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No one appreciates more than Qantas the importance of scrupulous attention to safety at all times. However, a public statement based on some unidentified reports without reasonable check with Qantas is clearly not a responsible or constructive approach.</PARA>
<PARA>The statement further says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Airlink is a wholly owned subsidiary of Qantas.</PARA>
<PARA>In the statement, Mr Strong goes on to talk about that and to repeat his point that Qantas has an enviable safety record. There was no checking by the member; he simply made a claim. A day or so ago the member said that the Royal Australian Air Force had permanently grounded its Nomad aircraft. This is untrue. I was advised by the chief of the general staff that no Nomad aircraft in army service are grounded, other than those in normal maintenance, and no ADF Nomads&mdash;that includes air force and army Nomads&mdash;have been grounded as a result of the most recent incident in the French West Indies. So that claim is wrong. The claim about Airlink was attacked by Mr Strong. This is the kind of unsubstantiated flurry of allegations that the member for Hume has trafficked in ever since these most unfortunate accidents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has acted quickly and appropriately and, as a consequence of the judicial inquiry, we will get to the bottom of the Seaview checks issue. The reform of the aviation safety system, with the establishment of an independent aviation safety agency, is probably the most appropriate change that the government is able to introduce to divorce air traffic management from the question of safety standards. A little less crowing, grandstanding and blackguarding from the member for Hume would help the whole debate.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The development allowance is an important addition to the tax incentives which are on offer by the government to attract more investment. This was intended to be a medium-term incentive to attract investment in large projects worth over $50 million. It was announced in One Nation, but the implementation of the allowance is a gradual process. To the end of the 1993-94 year, the Development Allowance Authority has registered 217 projects worth a total of $55 billion. The average registered project is worth around $250 million, well above the $50 million threshold. The allowance is obviously having the effect of attracting very large investments indeed. Another 200 projects are still being evaluated, and all up we can look forward to something in the order of 400 projects being finally registered with hopefully an outcome around the $100 billion mark.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Registration is the first step. Following that a project needs to receive a pre-qualifying certificate, which involves demonstrating that it meets various competitive criteria. It is important for us to have this competitiveness test because it requires projects to reflect best practice labour relations, to have significant inputs priced economically and efficiently, and to not be receiving significant levels of government assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are projects which are large but they also have to be projects which promote micro-economic reform by being at the leading edge in terms of their labour relations practices and the pricing of their inputs. In that respect, they are a doubly important factor in the economy at the present time. These large projects in themselves are helping to bring on the investment boom which is anticipated to occur in this financial year, with a 14 1/2 per cent increase in business investment expected&mdash;and certainly we would hope for strong investment in the years to come&mdash;and this development allowance clearly will be a factor in bringing about those projects. That is important, but the drive for further micro-economic reform is also important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Using our investment in the most efficient way is very important. We do not simply want to squander large amounts of money on large capital projects which utilise those funds inefficiently. That is not good for the nation&mdash;not good use of our resources, and not good for building our living standards. The criteria which are built into this program ensure that does not happen and that we will get from these projects highly efficient outcomes. One also hopes there will be incentives for other projects and other parts of the economy to improve their efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very important development for the economy. Construction has begun on $25 billion worth of the projects which have so far been registered. It is not simply a matter of them being a paper entry; this is something which is real and happening in respect of $25 billion worth already. It is also important to note that the survey conducted by the Development Allowance Authority indicates that these projects have an increasing focus on Asia, the Asian market being of greater importance than non-Asian markets because of the outlook for the end products of these projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, in terms of the prequalifying certificates where they have got to the final stage and can claim the allowance, so far there have been 11 projects which have achieved that prequalifying certificate, involving $2 billion worth of projects. There is obviously a lot more of that to come, and the development allowance will be a very important factor in helping our economy to grow substantially over the next several years.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has provided in the cultural policy statement announced on Tuesday $13 million over four years for SBS Television to commission high quality multicultural drama. This new fund is to be put into the independent production sector, which we believe will go a long way towards ensuring that Australians have a chance to see the rich mixture of contemporary Australian voices and faces on SBS Television. SBS is already internationally acclaimed as a multicultural broadcaster. It is the government's belief that up until now SBS has had little opportunity to produce quality Australian multicultural drama. Because of its limited resources it has relied on importing product produced overseas, in some cases from the Republic of Ireland&mdash;programs such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Glenrowan</EMPHASIS>, which will be of interest to some people in the Speaker's gallery this afternoon. That is because overseas products can be purchased at a much cheaper rate than Australian produced programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the government's very strong belief that SBS, by  commissioning works through independent producers, can develop a very strong export potential. Especially by linking up with potential markets in Europe and in the Asia-Pacific we believe that Australian produced products specially commissioned by SBS could be earning Australia export dollars in these markets. We think that with SBS's expertise in translation, in subtitling and in multicultural broadcasting there is as a real opportunity for these independent producers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also the government's belief that this will create a lot of employment for Australians of non-English speaking backgrounds and Australians of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent. The government will be very keen to ensure that SBS puts these funds into an independent organisation, to be known as SBS Independent, a branch of SBS that will ensure that all of the funds allocated go into the commissioning of this new production. We believe that out of the government's decision we will get about 30 hours a year of new multicultural drama which will be shown on SBS. I am sure all Australians will welcome that.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RH4">Mr KERR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am extraordinarily aware of reports regarding recoupment of proceeds of crime because of a press release by the shadow Attorney-General, one of the few press releases of the shadow Attorney-General, in which she made criticism of the government as not tracing or collecting proceeds of crime. She quoted the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Michael Rozenes QC, as having said that tens of millions of dollars go untraced and that money that could be collected is simply being missed because crime fighters are not paying enough attention to chasing the crime trail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is pretty serious stuff, but, unfortunately for the shadow minister, she did not accurately quote the Director of Public Prosecutions. He said no such thing. What he did say is exactly to the contrary. The paper which he delivered to a seminar in Tasmania states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth has a very effective armoury of weapons that can be used to recover ill-gotten gains in a variety of circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One pleasing aspect is the way in which the Proceeds of Crime Act has been enforced.</PARA>
<PARA>So there you have it. Contrary to what Senator Vanstone has said that tens of millions of dollars was going untraced, there is a clear and ringing endorsement by the Director of Public Prosecutions of what the Commonwealth has done, for our approach in the recovery of those proceeds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commonwealth law enforcement agencies have, under proceeds of crime legislation, recovered more than $23 million since December 1991. In fact, the National Crime Authority's report, tabled in this House yesterday, showed a record $15 million that was deposited in the consolidated assets trust fund in the past year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Vanstone did manage one accurate statement in her press release. She said that confiscated proceeds of crime should be put to the benefit of the community generally, and that is exactly what we are doing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last funding round, $5.23 million from the confiscated assets trust fund went back into federal law enforcement agencies.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He spat the bile out all at once. As a federal minister, the minister has to date a very distinguished record. Let me just recount some points. The minister has introduced groundbreaking legislation in industrial relations, and he has extended across-the-board the prospects of enterprise bargaining and improving the flexibility of the Australian labour market. He has also given figures in recent days of the growth of enterprise bargaining across the country, yet state industrial relations regimes operated by coalition ministers in New South Wales and Victoria have only a small proportion of the flexibility agreements which have now been enacted by the Commonwealth under the legislation of the minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time as doing that, the minister successfully introduced in the legislation the notion of a safety net for those Australian employees on lower incomes who cannot access enterprise bargaining and whom he and the government want to see protected from the callous policies espoused by the member for Bennelong, which would cut the wages of low income people. So that change&mdash;important socially and in terms of economic efficiency&mdash;is there for the spread of enterprise bargains across the work force. As the minister himself has said in recent days, this is in the climate of the lowest level of industrial disputes since the nation has been keeping data on industrial disputations. There is the record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to his stewardship of the transport portfolio&mdash;not a long time&mdash;his success to date has been to pilot through the Labor Party, at its conference, and the government the privatisation of the major airports of this country. This is a not inconsiderable achievement and one that is important in allowing greater facilities for important airports like those in Sydney or Melbourne. It is a policy which has been supported by the Victorian Liberal Party and government in respect of Melbourne airport and, of course, supported by other groups around the country. Not only has he done that; he is also reserving the option of a second airport for Sydney, building on the Badgerys Creek proposal and reserving the transport linkages between that and Kingsford-Smith airport. I would have thought these were substantial achievements by any measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also would have thought that the minister's acting firmly in terms of the BASI report and in terms of establishing the specialised safety agency and the judicial review into aviation was fairly significant.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note the Auditor-General's report on a special investigation into Casselden Place. This report reveals massive losses of $100 million on the project; that the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) and the Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan, may have inadvertently, at least, misled the people of Australia on the business deals made up to cover up these losses; and that there was massive waste and mishandling of the planning of the Casselden Place project. According to the Auditor-General's report, Casselden Place cost $194 million to construct, with an additional $22.7 million&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Mr Speaker, I would like to report to parliament on the outcome of the International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo from 5 to 13 September and to draw attention to the part Australia played.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's paramount concern at Cairo was to ensure that consensus be achieved on a strong, forward looking document. This was important both because of the critical goals contained within the draft program of action and the importance we place on the United Nations process of consensus in advancing international reform. In fact, the agreement reached at Cairo has been a triumph for that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major themes of the conference not only had the potential to generate controversy&mdash;potential which was fulfilled&mdash;but there was a strong possibility that the conference would split irreconcilably along north-south or religious lines. Such a split did not occur. Australia played its part in ensuring that agreement was reached on the widest possible range of issues and, just as importantly, that the program of action which emerged was indeed forward looking; that it built on, rather than withdrew from, previous agreements; and that it could be placed clearly within the framework of internationally accepted human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two major advances in thinking have occurred since the earlier UN population conferences in Bucharest in 1974 and Mexico City in 1984. The first is that population growth is seen as a global concern. The second is that population is no longer seen as a problem which can be tackled in isolation from social and economic conditions, particularly those which limit the power of women to control their own lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of Australia's major objectives at Cairo was to promote agreement on strategies for empowering women, strategies to enable them to enjoy equally with men the full range of human rights. The program of action translates the principle of female empowerment into a range of practical actions involving: greater educational and employment opportunities for women and girls; making marriage an equal partnership; taking steps to protect women and girls from physical abuse and exploitation; and enabling women to participate fully in decision making at all levels of society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program of action, in prescribing gender equality, calls on men to take greater responsibility for their actions and to assume an equal share in the raising of children. The document recognises the importance of families within society and urges governments to support them. It also acknowledges that there is variety in the forms which families may take. Australia, as a nation which accepts cultural diversity, was active in promoting this principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some countries sought to limit the obligations under the program of action by seeking to place religious, ethical and cultural considerations on the same plane as national sovereignty and universally recognised international human rights. Australia was one of a number of countries which worked to preserve the balance between these considerations to ensure that human rights were not compromised. Australia was also concerned to ensure that differences in views about contraception and abortion amongst member nations were not permitted to prevent agreement on strategies critical for addressing important issues of sexual and reproductive health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the Holy See and a small number of other states entered reservations in respect of chapters on sexual and reproductive health, wide agreement was nevertheless reached on a number of important new concepts in sexual and reproductive health not only encompassing physical wellbeing but also fulfilling human relationships. One of our major objectives was to achieve agreement on a program of action which would support the internationally agreed right of men and women to have the information and the means to determine the number and spacing of their children. Agreement was reached not only on the need to ensure the widest availability and choice in safe and acceptable family planning methods but also on the need for adolescents to have access to appropriate information, services and counselling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program of action enshrines the principles of freedom of choice and non-coercion in family planning programs but takes a strong position on making available the means to exercise that choice. It seeks to address problems such as the maternal and infant mortality associated with high-risk pregnancy and to minimise both the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and the need for abortion by making family planning and primary health care services as widely available as possible. For the first time, unsafe abortion and its consequences have been acknowledged as a major public health concern which governments are urged to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier, there is now widespread recognition that to be successful population programs need to integrate development and family planning objectives and to include strategies for addressing the social and economic disadvantage so often associated with high levels of population growth. The program of action adopts such an integrated approach, and Australia was pleased to contribute to this conclusion through the independent inquiry into population and development&mdash;a copy of the report being made available to other delegations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program of action commits both donors and developing country governments to closing the gender gap which exists at every level of the education system in the developing world. There are 130 million eligible children who are not enrolled in primary school and 70 per cent of those are girls. Education is essential to the social development of countries and the dignity and wellbeing of its population. Lack of education, particularly for girls, exacts a development cost in terms of lost opportunities to slow population growth, raise incomes, productivity and the quality of life. That said, improving basic education, particularly for girls, is not a simple task and it requires action in a wide range of sectors, including particular efforts in training teachers and strengthening institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia will be seeking to increase funding in the education sector. We have already significantly increased assistance to health and population programs. Our task will be to design effective, culturally appropriate assistance that consolidates the efforts already being made by developing country governments. The program of action recognises that significant additional resources will be required to translate the goals of Cairo into reality. The Australian government will be endeavouring to do its fair share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also agreement to allocate resources for broader reproductive health concerns in addition to family planning programs. They also include maternal health, prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV-AIDS, and basic actions for collecting and analysing population data. This approach is consistent with Australia's development assistance programs which focus on women's empowerment, their health and education as essential to population programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although it is important that population and development issues be pursued in concert, it is also important that governments develop policies which embody the principle of sustainability. Another important objective for the Australian delegation at Cairo was that of securing continued commitment to the principle that all economic activity, in developed and developing countries alike, should be environmentally sustainable. Australia was one of a small number of countries which pursued sustainable development issues consistently throughout the preparatory process and during the conference itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am happy to report that the program of action builds on the international agreement reached at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development at Rio. It does this by reiterating the importance of the concept of sustainability and strengthening language on the relationship between production, consumption and population. No fewer than five of the 15 principles adopted by the conference highlight the significance of sustainability in ensuring the future wellbeing of the world's population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concerns of indigenous peoples are important in the context of a program of action which deals with development and population. At Cairo we argued for explicit recognition of the needs of indigenous peoples in the program of action, not just because they comprise marginalised and disadvantaged groups in many societies, including our own, but as custodians of values which reflect a uniquely durable relationship with the environment. Indigenous peoples often have a cultural and spiritual attachment to the environment which goes beyond economics and which could be threatened by unsustainable development and some forms of population growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia was very active at the preceding preparatory committee meetings in New York in strengthening references to indigenous peoples throughout the text. It also managed to have a principle on indigenous peoples accepted within the revised draft set of 15 principles considered in Cairo, despite the number of draft principles having been reduced from 33, none of which dealt with indigenous peoples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia, along with many other nations, is now pleased that a principle was adopted in Cairo which calls on member nations to recognise and support the identity, culture and interests of indigenous peoples and to enable them to participate fully in the economic, political and social life of the country. The program of action also calls on governments to respect the cultures of indigenous peoples, to enable them to own and manage territories, protect and restore natural resources and ecosystems on which they depend and to take these into account when formulating national policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some difficult migration issues had to be addressed at the Cairo conference, and it was important to achieve a balance between the need for national sovereignty and recognition of the needs of refugees and migrants and the contribution that they can make. One issue that emerged with unexpected force in Cairo was the question of the right of family reunion. Few countries have recognised the benefits and desirability of family migration more than Australia. However, Australia and many other countries, including the other traditional countries of migration, were not prepared to concede a right, particularly when its application to family groups was uncertain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, Australia was happy to be able to play a key role in brokering a solution calling on countries to recognise the value of family reunion and to reflect it in their legislation, as we have done in Australia, and which refers to article 10 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. This requires member nations to deal humanely and expeditiously with applications for family reunion between parents and children and to respect the right of exit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to turn briefly to the future. Member nations are committed to regularly assessing their progress towards implementation of the program of action and reporting on a periodic basis. Many of the goals set out within the program are ones to which Australia has already given high priority and the targets are more than met. In other areas, Australia meets standards at a national level but needs to continue to address the needs of particular groups, such as indigenous peoples, people in rural and remote areas and people from non-English speaking backgrounds. Australia needs to position itself early in ensuring that it meets, or more than meets, the objectives of the program of action. A detailed examination of the program of action has therefore been initiated and further statements on the results of this review are expected to be made early next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to all those who contributed to Australia's success at Cairo, particularly Richard Woolcott, chair of the National Advisory Committee, and Ambassador Butler. I single out particularly the parliamentary members of the delegation, including the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), who is at the table, who made a particular contribution&mdash;one for which I was personally very grateful.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday in the House and, indeed, over the last couple of days, the opposition has been leading a campaign highlighting its concerns about the state of air safety in Australia. Yesterday I made a speech which outlined the fairly brief history of the Civil Aviation Authority, which is the policeman of our aviation industry, and highlighted that, even though it has a brief history, it is one centred on controversy and a great deal of concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also pointed out yesterday that there had been a very significant failure on the part of the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) to respond to and act upon concerns that I expressed to this parliament about Seaview Air in a speech in May this year. I pointed out to the House that it was five months from the date of my speech in this House about Seaview Air before the minister decided to require a response from the Civil Aviation Authority about the concerns I had expressed. He raised those questions, or asked for that response from the CAA, only after the Seaview Air crash of 2 October this year. I created a picture, if you like, of some of the concerns we have and of the failure of the minister to respond as clearly and as correctly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note his entry to the chamber, having not been here for question time today when an issue for which he is responsible is one of the central issues of the day causing concern right throughout the community. The fact that he was not prepared today or on Tuesday to confront questions on this subject highlights the dereliction of the minister in his duties. I noticed that the Minister for Transport came in for the division a few minutes ago. Who did he sit next to&mdash;none other than Ros Kelly! I note he is getting used to her company because she sits on the backbench&mdash;and that is where you will be very shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, I also responded to the calls by the minister to provide more detail about the concerns I have about aviation safety in this country. I outlined those concerns in the form of discussing and, indeed, trying to table documents about the matters surrounding an airline called Airlink&mdash;not Air Link which is another airline based in Dubbo and is not the one I refer to. Airlink is owned by National Jet Systems, carries Qantas's colours and is marketed by Qantas because National Jet Systems is owned by Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raised the matter of Airlink in this House because it was an airline I had specific concerns about. It does not give me any pleasure to have to raise these concerns in this fashion. I do it because of the minister's failure in his duty of care over the last several months to ensure that air safety in Australia has been maintained. The only way I can ensure the minister will act is to do things in the way I did yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk about the two operations I mentioned in this parliament: Airlink and what is now called the Phoenix Aero Club, which used to be called the New South Wales Police Aero Club. I raised the story about Airlink, and tried to table the document, because of some very serious concerns I had. Before I go into those concerns, it was interesting to note that when I tried to table the document yesterday, after the minister had been calling for me to do such a thing, the minister would not allow me to table it. It was a very silly thing the minister did. He realised that not long after he got back to his office and he wrote to me and said, `Would you please give me the document now and I will take the matter up for you?'</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying, the concerns that I have about Airlink are based on a number of grounds. Firstly, Airlink has been using unauthorised, unqualified people to carry out maintenance on BAE 146 aircraft. I cited specific examples in the document I gave the minister yesterday of that occurring. I also pointed out that it was not just people like me raising these concerns but that licensed aircraft mechanics from both Qantas and Ansett had raised concerns with the CAA about these deficiencies in Airlink's maintenance procedures. I also pointed out that the Airlink company had these concerns passed on to the CAA and that the CAA had not done anything about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also pointed out in the document I gave the minister that the company was set up in 1990 by a person who was, until he started working for Airlink, the manager of CAA in South Australia. He did not actually leave his employment from CAA. This gentleman, Mr Barry Lodge, took a 12-month leave of absence&mdash;technically still employed by CAA&mdash;and set up the airline Airlink. Whilst he was doing that, the person who took his place as the manager of CAA in South Australia gave the airline that Mr Barry Lodge was setting up all of the authorities and all of the licences to set up the airline and get it operating. At the end of the 12 months, what happened? Barry Lodge, the former general manager of CAA in South Australia who had taken leave of absence, resigned formally and the gentleman who had taken his place, who had given him all of the licences and endorsements needed to set the airline up, resigned from CAA and got a job with guess who&mdash;Airlink!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the problem. There are clear examples in the document I gave the minister yesterday of deficiencies in the maintenance procedures of a particular airline that are being reported to the CAA, for which action has not been undertaken to correct the problem. If you look at the way the airline was set up in the first instance, you come back to the very core issue of this whole problem: this unholy relationship between the CAA, the policeman of our airlines, and the airline operators themselves. They are running hand in hand. Airlink is a classic example of the problem. That is exactly why I raised it in the manner that I did yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also raised another concern about the Phoenix Aero Club, which was called the New South Wales Police Aero Club. It is a pilot training school based at Bankstown airport. What is the problem with it? The problems with this aero club are such that earlier this year the New South Wales police commissioner withdrew his patronage from the aero club and had the name `police' removed from the operation of the aero club because of his concerns with the maintenance procedures and the activities of the club. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are those concerns? Those concerns relate to the person who was maintaining not only the aircraft at this aero club but also other aircraft. This licensed aircraft maintenance engineer was renting space in the aero club's hangars to carry out his business. The members of the club's committee finally realised that this person was not maintaining the aircraft in a safe fashion. It had been pointed out to him by other licensed aircraft maintenance engineers that there were some serious deficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The club decided to report the deficiencies. The deficiencies are quite serious. I will give you an idea of some of the problems it had. In one of the training aircraft that the club operated the pilot seat had broken and actually sat on the floor of the aircraft. Student pilots could not see over the dashboard. In order to see over the dashboard they put cushions on the seat. Do you realise that that deficiency in the aircraft lasted for five 100-hourly maintenance checks? It is illegal for an aircraft pilot's seat to be broken in that fashion. Yet the person licensed to maintain these aircraft allowed it to go on for five 100-hourly maintenance checks before the problem was corrected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only did that happen but the licensed aircraft maintenance engineer went on holidays for six months. He put his son-in-law in charge of running the aircraft maintenance business. His son-in-law is not a qualified aircraft maintenance engineer and he is not certificated to sign off aircraft for maintenance purposes to ensure that they can continue to fly. But his son-in-law did all of those things. He maintained the aircraft and, in addition, signed off that these aircraft were in proper order as if he were a certificated LAME&mdash;licensed aircraft maintenance engineer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The club committee was absolutely alarmed at what was going on and so it decided that something had to be done. It reported it to the CAA. The airworthiness inspectors at the CAA recommended not only that this licensed aircraft maintenance engineer should lose his licence but also that the fellow should be prosecuted. Do you know what happened? A person higher up in the CAA blocked it. He said, `Oh, no. This isn't the right way to go. This person ought to be counselled.' A compromise was finally arranged. The CAA said, `We'll put the fellow through a written examination for his licence again to ensure that he is up to speed.' That did not happen either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, it appears, so we are told, that the person who blocked the original recommendation actually carried out, in his words, an oral examination of the person and approved his licence renewal. No-one else was there to see whether it was done; no-one else was there to see whether he got the answers right or wrong. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is outrageous, as has been pointed out. They are the sorts of concerns that ordinary Australians should have. But, if ordinary Australians are not concerned enough about that, they have only to look at the submissions to the air safety inquiry that were released last night by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), the chairman of the inquiry. If members go to submission No. 56, they will see that it is a submission written by a person who is the head of the Civil Aviation Authority's fatigue section, a bloke by the name of Steve Swift. He is a professional aeronautical engineer with 17 years experience in the aviation business. In his brief report he says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the last ten years I have observed a deterioration in CAA's ability to efficiently set and supervise fatigue safety standards for Australia's growing, and ageing fleet. It has reached the point where the flying public is exposed to an unacceptable risk of structural failure&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>He then goes on to talk about the particular airlines for which these fatigue stress problems are most prominent. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, is the Aero Commander . . . Thirty years ago wings started breaking off by fatigue. Later, serious corrosion problems developed.</PARA>
<PARA>He then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another is the Piper Chieftain, the type which crashed at Young. Cracks are occurring in the part which joins the wings together.</PARA>

<PARA>Some 200 of these aircraft, which are very commonly used as commuter planes in Australia, are at risk of losing their wings right now. What other statement could you get that would cause you more alarm?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst it is the CAA's responsibility on a day-to-day basis to maintain air safety in this country, there is one person who is ultimately responsible for maintaining it, and that is the minister&mdash;the man sitting opposite us today.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted that the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) has been stupid enough to submit this MPI today because without it I might not have had the opportunity to make some of the comments that I am about to make here in parliament about the behaviour of the honourable member for Hume. They relate particularly to his behaviour over the last 24 hours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable members know, today was my day out of question time. But I am very pleased to be here for this matter of public importance. All week, I have been at the honourable member to explain why he declined to use the appropriate channels to provide the information he allegedly had about shonky operators, even though three separate approaches were made to him&mdash;the first approach being made on 5 May this year, the day after he stood in this parliament and made his allegations for the first time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first excuse he used was that he could not trust the CAA. Yet he was offered confidentiality through the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation. The second, which he outlined in his letters, was that he was having discussions with me. He wanted a parliamentary inquiry&mdash;a parliamentary inquiry that I gave him and for which he put out a press release praising me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Did he have any doubts about the avenues that were offered to him in those cases being the appropriate channels? Look at what he had to say only this morning in his latest effort about Airlink. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I think the important thing is to get it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>meaning the allegations&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">checked out and it can only really be checked out via the procedures that the Civil Aviation Authority has . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is what you said in your interview this morning&mdash;exactly. They need to be checked out through John Pike, the man who grounded Seaview after he received hard evidence about its conduct, or BASI's confidential reporting system. This was offered to you before and has been available to you at every point along the way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet the honourable member declined to use these avenues previously. Today he is admitting that these are the appropriate avenues to take. At least now, after a week of asking from me, he has decided to use those avenues in respect of Airlink. Airlink is a 100 per cent wholly owned subsidiary of Qantas. But he did not decide to use these procedures before he publicly dragged Airlink's name and, by association, the name of its owner, Qantas&mdash;the safest airline in the world, Australia's own national carrier&mdash;through the dirt. This operation is owned by Qantas, flying under the Qantas livery. You dragged its name and its reputation through the dirt. You did it before you had a chance to use the avenues that you acknowledged only this morning were the appropriate ones to ascertain whether the allegations were true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was the timing of the honourable member? The day of a serious incident involving our second major international carrier, Ansett. How utterly irresponsible of you to proceed in this way! If honourable members want to know just how worried some people are about this issue being pursued responsibly, they should look at what Steven Holle from the Australian Tourism Industry Association said today in a story entitled `ATIA warns air safety concerns could damage the tourism industry'. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ATIA policy and research manager Steve Holle said Australia's aviation industry had an enviable safety record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But incidents like that of the Ansett crash on the Sydney runway yesterday, the fatal flight of the Seaview plane on the way to Lord Howe Island and speculation about air safety standards could cause damage to tourism.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, if the debate leads to an improvement in the bureaucratic processes . . . and in the safety performance of the airlines then there can only be a benefit&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members should look at the question the honourable member got this morning on radio station 4BC. The interviewer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well the Transport Minister Laurie Brereton last night was attempting to re-assure the travelling public about safety. I'm just wondering if comments such as yours would not only be damaging to the industry here but also could damage our reputation internationally.</PARA>
<PARA>He said to you:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . you said yourself, you hope you're wrong, if you're wrong could I suggest a lot of the damage has already been done.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the proposition put to the honourable member this morning. And what did you say in reply? You said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I . . . hope I am wrong . . .</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will withdraw the remark, Mr Deputy Speaker. These are the people who have come into this House this week and accused me of being the minister for news clips. That is what they called out across the chamber. Yesterday, when it came to news, you certainly knew where your priorities lay, did you not? The honourable member was running around the gallery criticising me for not letting him table a document here in the parliament. But it was on a day that Ansett had had a major incident, where there was already public concern. I have to admit: I did not want to see an as yet unsubstantiated, as yet uninvestigated, allegation referring to safety becoming a public document. Twenty-five years of public life have told me it was the right thing to do to take that approach&mdash;particularly when it involves Qantas, the 100 per cent owner of Airlink.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member knows that immediately after the MPI yesterday, as soon as I left this chamber, I offered to get these allegations checked out in a confidential way by the appropriate authorities and to have the honourable member informed about the progress of the investigations. We were  already having them investigated immediately through the appropriate channels, that is, through Mr John Pike. But what if they were not true; what if they were not correct? What if the honourable member was as wrong in those allegations about Qantas as he was in his statement in this parliament about Western Airlines? What do you say in those circumstances to Airlink? What do you say in those circumstances to Qantas? <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member basically did not care. He wanted to get out there and score some cheap political points. He wanted to do that rather than do the responsible thing. He did not care for one moment about dragging Qantas's name through the dirt. He knew then, as he has known all along and as he knows today, that this company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Qantas. The honourable member chose to do this without giving Qantas a chance to answer or to investigate the material that he had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">James Strong phoned him last night after the damage was already done. He had to put out a statement which indicated that Qantas was not unaware of the allegations and that it had had them checked out. Now he will do it again, and John Pike will investigate them. But, had the honourable member chosen to do the responsible thing, that would have happened anyway, and it would have happened properly and with confidentiality. Instead, it is being done now after the damage has been done to the name of Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been in politics long enough to know one thing, and that is you can get a stream of leaks&mdash;it always happens in opposition&mdash;but it is another thing to know how to use them responsibly. I put it to the House that the honourable member has displayed the very worst of judgment in how he has handled this matter. The reality is&mdash;and we should all know this&mdash;that leaks are not always going to be true and they always need to be investigated. People do not always leak to you in the interests of safety. Sometimes they have other agendas to pursue. Sometimes they have other motives. Sometimes they are not wholly motivated by safety considerations. Sometimes their views are coloured by other considerations. That is why you have always got to be responsible. That is why you have always got to go through proper process&mdash;exactly what the honourable member did not do yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for this reason that we have the various channels available to investigate these claims. It is for that reason that you have a parliamentary inquiry, the inquiry set up to pursue allegations. But in pursuing them I stress to the House that you have to act responsibly and use the correct channels&mdash;that you yourself acknowledged today as the appropriate ones&mdash;the ones that you chose not to use earlier on this year and that you chose not to use on the basis of confidentiality as offered to you by me yesterday afternoon. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about the fact that five months ago the minister was warned about the situation and all these extra people lost their lives before he came up with some responses in the last week or so.

He should not come in here and grin and smirk, as he did today, and say, `I am smarter than you are.' It has nothing to do with smartness. It is a tragedy. The member for Hume would be the saddest man in this parliament that his predictions have been tragically vindicated. But the minister did not do anything about it until it was too late. Today he is saying, `You might be damaging our tourist industry.' No, the minister's inactivity for the last five months is damaging our tourist industry and he stands condemned for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's inference was, `It is our national icon.' Therefore, apparently, it can do things. It can use people who are not fully licensed to carry out maintenance on its aircraft. Is that true? Do you believe that? That is what he said.

It is a very nice little motel called The Coasters and it is operated by a mother and daughter. Whereas on television last night and today we have heard from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) about the widespread access to enterprise agreements, I want to quote an example of a small family-run motel being wrecked by the lack of enterprise agreement and by the hard-fisted impact of the award system.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fourth lady is employed `live-in', and the agreed payment has been $250 for approx 20 hours per week and the value of the rent to be worked off by attending telephones and desk for various times. This position was created and discussed with the Lismore Office for the State Awards and seemed to be in order for them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of the first visit by the Federal Officer the other 4 members of staff went into his office (3 together and 1 separately). The older group tried to explain to the officer that they were 100% happy with their pay, hours and conditions. They did not want changes and did not want any back pay. They were told that they also had to conform with the award and that means they cannot work less than 3 hours daily.</PARA>
<PARA>If you work one hour a week you are not counted as unemployed, so how can the award force these women to work three hours daily if they do not want to and the work is not there? The letter continues:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A part-time worker can be so called provided they complete no less than 48 hours in any 4 week period, working not less than 3 hrs a day and no more than 128 in the same 4 weeks.</PARA>

<PARA>Where is the sense in this? The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are now left in the situation where we will probably have to dispense with the ladies who we pay $10 per hour. Mainly because they do not want to work a minimum of 3 hrs, and secondly (and most importantly) we cannot provide the work.</PARA>
<PARA>They own only a small motel. The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The usual day is 2 ladies approx 2 to 2 1/2 hours. This will equate to 1 lady 4 to 5 hours. Not one of them will accept that. Currently they work together, enjoy the company and are happy with their pay. They are mature women who run family homes and in some cases do other little jobs for charity. They do not want to increase their hours here as they find the work too hard for long periods.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one denies that there are troubles in civil aviation. I worked for five years in the aviation industry and I know considerably more about it than do most members opposite. It is complex. Problems do arise and there are plenty of troubles. That is why the minister has appointed a judicial inquiry into the Civil Aviation Authority. The opposition has demanded the minister's resignation because he has allegedly failed to adequately deal with the situation in the Civil Aviation Authority. He has not failed. He has done the first thing that he should do, and that is compile the facts. He has appointed Sir Laurence Street to do the job. Who would the opposition suggest for the job&mdash;Jeff Kennett's friend who has the Crown Casino licence? He may be a little busy counting his money and sending the Liberal Party its share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amongst the welter of problems in civil aviation are some which have been forwarded to the Australian Federal Police. It is not the minister's fault if any crimes have been committed. His duty is to see that any allegations of crime are promptly dealt with. This he has done. The minister has acted decisively and appropriately, and to suggest anything else is malicious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If opposition members think that the minister is responsible for crimes that took place under his portfolio jurisdiction, then they must hold the minister for health responsible for every case of medical malpractice, the Treasurer responsible for every shonky tax return, and the minister for schools responsible for every bit of homework that is not done. Obviously politics&mdash;not policy&mdash;motivates opposition members in their attacks. A key indicator of this is the absolute silence of the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) and the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). Those in this political double act&mdash;our very own Bib and Bub&mdash;are not participating in this effort because they do not want to give the honourable member for Mayo, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer), a victory. The game plan is for the honourable member for Mayo to struggle along and become an even greater figure of fun&mdash;like Pooh Bear with his head stuck in the honey pot&mdash;and then replace him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong and the honourable member for Higgins will then face the Prime Minister at the next election. It is a great plan. It will probably succeed. Then the voters will reject the honourable member for Bennelong for a second time. Why? Because the voters want a government with policies and the honourable member for Bennelong has only one policy. It is the fundamental policy of the Liberal Party&mdash;that is, to stand on street corners waving the Union Jack and cheering as she goes by. This is 1994, not 1954. The Liberal Party refuses to accept this and so we will continue to govern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this froth and bubble from the coalition about Minister Brereton is driven by politics. The minister has done what needs to be done. He has appointed an inquiry and, based on the inquiry's findings, action is being taken. I personally have worked in this industry and know that the level of morale is very high. I also know that Australia, under all party governments, has had an excellent record in civil aviation matters. Members opposite should think with their brains and not their ambitions before they say anything to damage our tourist trade. Overseas visitors do not need to read Australian political point scoring and think that these remarks are accurate. We have a $9 billion tourist industry&mdash;most of it airborne&mdash;and we need it to grow bigger.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Get back on your bike, Leo. It is very important for the whole nation that this area be put into tiptop shape by the time the Olympics start. The state government, to its credit, is doing a very great deal towards remedying a hundred years of neglect. In the 1870s the first plans were proposed for a railway in this area, and Bradfield wanted to put a railway in when the Sydney Harbour Bridge was built. The Wran government shamefully neglected this part of Sydney, as it shamefully neglected most parts of Sydney. The state government is to be congratulated for its efforts to build a community consensus on the forms of transport infrastructure that the Warringah Peninsula needs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government is to be condemned. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the same Prime Minister who is prepared to offer $150 million to tear down a perfectly functioning road and rail system, the Cahill Expressway, has not offered a cent to improve this much more vital piece of transport infrastructure. The Prime Minister, who is prepared to give $250 million to his mates in the arts industry, ought to be prepared to match state government money to improve the infrastructure in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all used to wonder about the amount on the IOU that the Prime Minister wrote to the arts community at the time of the last election.

<TITLE>Haemophiliacs: Factor VIII</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I wish to draw the attention of the House to the plight of haemophiliacs around Australia. There is currently a crisis in the supply of factor VIII in Australia, a blood component necessary for blood clotting. This is absent in the blood of haemophiliacs and thus replacement with the derived plasma product or the artificial product is necessary to prevent uncontrolled haemorrhage. The Australian Blood Transfusion Society recommended in 1993 that three international units of factor VIII per capita should be the standard supply in Australia. At best, the amount available is a paltry 1.6 international units.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether a person will suffer from haemophilia is determined before birth by one's genetic configuration. It is incurable and, as such, correct medical management requires lifelong vigilance. If this government is serious about being equitable in providing preventable health measures to all Australians, it needs to consider increasing the supply of factor VIII. There are other medical conditions for which the government readily provides large amounts of funding through the pharmaceutical benefits schedule: for example, Paget's disease of the bone, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, Parkinson's disease, various congenital metabolic deficiency syndromes and neoplastic diseases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A general shortage of factor VIII means that stocks for haemophiliacs requiring elective surgery are at times inaccessible. This has included orthopaedic, cardiac and gastrointestinal surgery. In the long term, patients are frequently denied access to treatment which would prevent the tragic complications that I have mentioned previously. Adequate supply of factor VIII would allow most sufferers to lead near normal lives. Haemophiliacs themselves would suffer fewer and less severe bleeds, which would reduce the risk of death due to haemorrhage; elective surgery would be performed more promptly; and the long-term destabilising effects of recurrent bleeds would be minimised. Other less measurable benefits also deserve mention&mdash;the improvement in the quality of life experienced by haemophiliacs and their families due to their ability to perform the activities of daily living with less interruption and with less worry about their future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Serum Laboratories manufacture factor VIII from blood donations. There are two problems with relying on this product: donations have been in short supply for some time, meaning that there is not enough plasma available to produce the necessary quantity of factor VIII; and there is also the problem of product quality. During the 1980s the haemophiliac community in Australia endured the tragedy of infected blood products. Several severe haemophiliacs contracted the HIV virus and more recently hepatitis C. Haemophiliacs deserve special sympathy because of these events and should be considered a priority target for quality health care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The artificial products, while common overseas, are in the process of being approved in Australia. Known as recombinant DNA, it is more expensive but it is pure and does not carry the risk of infection. Action has not been forthcoming. The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) will not fund the cost of the supply of factor VIII. This government will probably lay the blame for the stalemate on recalcitrant state governments. The Minister for Human Services and Health cannot shirk the responsibility she has to provide enough funds to maintain the basic health services of Australians in need. Compared to other OECD nations, such as Canada, the United States and Great Britain, Australia is neglecting this issue. The government should discontinue the prolonging of the suffering of haemophiliacs and their families. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to bring to the House's attention a classic case of gross insincerity by this country's Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Today we heard him again make reference to his concern for people who are suffering from the drought. I want to show just how insincere he really is when it comes to genuinely trying to help people who are trying to help others suffering from a drought.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to tell a story about the real generosity of some real Australians who live in my electorate. The Timboon Lions Club, to its credit, organised for donations of hay to be sent to Queensland to help people suffering from the drought. They were very generous&mdash;they arranged for a total of 62 semi loads of hay to be sent to Queensland to help farmers whose stock are starving because of the drought. I think that generosity deserves the applause of all honourable members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to point out how niggardly the Prime Minister is when it comes to doing something genuine to help in this drought. Obviously that hay has to get up to Queensland and this is a very expensive exercise. As a local member, I asked whether the Prime Minister would assist, at least in part, by, say, forgoing the excise on fuel required for the carting of this hay. So far, the Prime Minister&mdash;in true form&mdash;has not even bothered to respond to the request.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The farmers were not the only people who were generous. Shell donated a lot of the fuel to help send some of the hay up as well. If honourable members were to sit down and look at just what it cost to get 62 truck loads of hay from Timboon to Queensland, they would find that the amount of fuel excise that had to be paid exceeded $50,000&mdash;it worked out to be around $53,000. The Prime Minister and the government are quite happy to cream off $53,000 from the generosity of those who are trying to help other Australians. Frankly, not to acknowledge or support the generosity of the people who are trying to help those who are suffering from this horrendous drought would be un-Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to draw the attention of the House to just how insincere the Prime Minister is. He will not even acknowledge what those people have done. He should do the decent thing and say that the government is prepared to forgo the $53,000. The work that is being done by the Lions Club in Timboon is a fabulous example of what it means to be an Australian. Many farmers have donated this hay and many people from Lions Clubs around Australia have helped to distribute it. It is a generous exercise and the government should come to the party and help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I call on the Prime Minister, even at this late stage, to tell us that his government is prepared to refund this money. Given the sincerity of farmers in the Timboon district&mdash;and right throughout areas in western Victoria, where there have been better rains than in many other parts of Australia&mdash;I believe that if the government were to be seen to be genuinely interested in the voluntary efforts of others, it may well find that others in the area would be forthcoming in giving more assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that, in the true spirit of what it means to be an Australian, the government would have been prepared to refund this money. This is a classic case of the generosity of others being taxed by the Labor Party, which is very un-Australian. All members of the Labor Party would be ashamed of the Prime Minister's attitude. This is a really generous donation by the people in my electorate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not come here to talk on this matter, but I wish to take issue with some of the comments made by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker). I have not heard so much sickening drivel for quite some time. There is no doubt that the Lions Club in Timboon is to be congratulated for supplying fodder to Queensland. The Lions Club in Timboon knows what the rules are. To come in here and whinge, like the honourable member for Wannon has, about taxation measures, not Labor Party measures, and expect the taxation system to be adjusted for this one incident&mdash;which is one of generosity, no doubt&mdash;is absolutely absurd. It is a nonsense way of going about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I were the honourable member for Wannon, I would have made sure that those semi-trailers left the properties full of excise-free diesel from the farms. No-one would have questioned that. Shell was very generous in supplying fuel. Obviously, the last component of this fuel excise has already been paid. No-one has taken one iota away from the generosity of people in the electorate of Wannon. But for him to come in here and whinge about the excise that was charged on the fuel to get the hay to Queensland&mdash;a cost is incurred to get fodder anywhere&mdash;and expect a special provision to be made on the whole taxation system is simply absurd. I suggest that the member for Wannon should do something useful rather than come in here with this heart on the sleeve, tear-jerking drivel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I originally came in here to talk about the attacks on the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) that I have had to endure in this parliament. I have no particular brief for the minister one way or the other, but I know that he has one of the most complex jobs. For members of the opposition to get up here and attack the minister as though they expect him to be down there personally inspecting the planes himself is absolutely ridiculous. To put it bluntly, the honourable for Hume (Mr Sharp) has performed very badly in this regard. He had information from the CAA that he was not prepared to table. He took measures to get himself put on the civil aviation inquiry of the transport, communications and infrastructure committee, a very good committee of which I am a member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these committee hearings, Mr Sharp is so far playing quite an intelligent part. He is asking sensible questions and is getting answers which would lead him to understand quite clearly the process that is taking place. The reality is that there are always going to be air crashes in this country and in every other country. The reality is that we have fewer in this country than most countries do. The only way that you can stop aeroplanes from crashing is to stop them from flying. That is simply an absurd notion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) gave a sickening performance when he came in here with his heart on his sleeve and spoke about the loss of life. Yes, lives have been lost. It is a sad thing, particularly for the relatives of those involved. But to say that this is the responsibility of the minister is absolutely absurd. Quite frankly, short of going down there with a spanner in his hand and checking every aircraft, the minister could not have done any more. Yet, we have the Leader of the National Party saying that it is all because the minister has not been down to see the Civil Aviation Authority headquarters. What difference would that make? I cannot think of anything more irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This really goes to the heart of what is wrong with politics in Australia today, particularly with the Liberal Party. The party is devoid of policy direction, it is devoid of ideology and it is devoid of a sense of purpose. It is simply nitpicking. The problem in Australia though, as I have seen in my own state, is that you can get such a gale up with this sort of attack ad hominem&mdash;when you attack people not on the basis of the performance of their duty but on personal grounds&mdash;and, with the media as it is in Australia, a McCarthyist attitude is generated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to members of parliament and to the people of Australia that the minister, as minister of aviation, has done everything that one could reasonably expect a minister to do. He has behaved, in my view, with total probity in this area. The Liberal Party ought to start looking to real issues, rather than trying to drum up problems where they do not exist and trying to condemn a man who has done his job certainly as well as ministers of aviation in the past have done. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Real Australians are prepared to put their hands up and say, `I'll do it; it was my fault; I'll just shoot through when the need arises.' Real Australians do not look down at the ground shuffling their feet saying, `It is too hard for me' or `It was her fault, get rid of her.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill presents amendments necessary to implement the remaining part of the budget package for the veterans' affairs portfolio. Honourable members will recall that the first part of the package was dealt with by the parliament in the winter sittings. In developing this package extensive, constructive and valuable consultations with the ex-service community were held by me and my predecessor, Senator Faulkner. These consultations were welcomed by both the government and the ex-service community and it is my hope that we may continue to work together in the future to provide the best possible care and recognition for veterans and their dependants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget package was developed to address the most pressing needs of ex-servicemen and women, war widows and widowers and their dependants. It responded to issues raised by Professor Peter Baume, Air Vice-Marshal Richard Bomball and Ms Robyn Layton in their report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Fair Go</EMPHASIS>. It also responded to issues raised by other groups in respect of the ageing of veterans of the world wars, and the different set of difficulties facing younger veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now turn to the specific measures included in this bill. The first initiative will affect service pensioners and income support supplement recipients. The treatment of their compensation payments, such as accident, sickness and workers compensation payments, will be aligned with the way in which compensation payments received by recipients of comparable social security payments are treated under the Social Security Act. This will ensure equitable assessment of income support payments made by both departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without going into detail, receipt of compensation payments may affect the rate and payability of service pension and income support supplement. The purpose of these provisions is to prevent double dipping. They only apply where a person receives a compensation payment which includes a component for loss of earnings or loss of the capacity to earn, and then only if the service pension or income support supplement recipient is under pension age. The new arrangements will only apply to compensation payments received on or after 1 January 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pensions that are not for income support are not included in these new arrangements. Already a person in receipt of disability pension or war widows or widowers pension may have the rate of that pension reduced if the compensation payments are paid in respect of the same injury or disease for which the pension is being paid. Thus, in the case of a person who receives both a disability pension and service pension, any compensation payments which have been used to reduce the payment of the disability pension will not be taken into account again to affect the payment of a person's service pension. Similar arrangements will also apply to a person in receipt of both a war widows or widowers pension and income support supplement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next initiative provides automatic eligibility for a funeral benefit to be paid to the estate of a veteran who, at the time of death, was receiving extreme disablement adjustment or was a former prisoner of war. In a large percentage of such cases a funeral benefit would be paid under the existing rules, but not automatically. In many cases these veterans leave behind a grieving partner, who will no longer need to forward an application in that time of grief, nor will the partner suffer any anxiety about the availability of the benefit. Automatic eligibility for funeral benefit already applies to certain other groups of pensioners. The addition of these new groups will provide uniformity by granting a funeral benefit in all cases in which an automatic grant of war widows or widowers pension applies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another initiative in this bill will be of benefit to applicants to the Veterans Review Board. Until now they may have had to meet certain costs of obtaining medical evidence to submit to the board out of their own pocket. Now they will be reimbursed those costs. They will be entitled to payment of an amount up to $425 for each condition subject to review, as well as an allowance for associated travelling expenses. Already the cost of certain medical evidence obtained at the primary determining level may be reimbursed. The introduction of this change is in response to a recommendation of the Baume committee. I expect that it will encourage applicants to present their supporting evidence as soon as they can. Currently some applicants appear to withhold evidence until it can be presented at the Administrative Appeals Tribunal because in some cases such costs can be met through legal aid grants. By meeting some or all of the costs involved in obtaining this evidence at an earlier stage, it is possible that a decision in favour of the applicant may be recorded earlier. This would avoid the need for many applicants to pursue an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further initiative will allow for the payment of an education entry payment to partner and carer service pensioners and to income support supplement recipients. Education entry payments are paid annually to meet some of the costs of enrolling in a course of study. They assist pensioners under pension age to further their education, thereby improving their employment prospects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next initiative is of particular benefit to refugees. It will remove the waiting period for service pension for those Commonwealth veterans, allied veterans and allied mariners who were given permanent resident status as refugees. They will no longer need to have been Australian residents for a continuous period of 10 years nor will they need to meet the rules for non-continuous periods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These requirements are being eased because refugees, unlike other migrants, do not have a choice when leaving their home countries. They also experience greater resettlement difficulties and are less likely to obtain a pension from their countries of origin. I am informed that this initiative has been warmly received within those segments of our multicultural society where refugees are represented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another initiative will mean that pharmaceutical allowance will be paid only to a person who is in Australia. Short-term absences, however, will not be taken into account. Pharmaceutical allowance was introduced in 1990 to compensate pensioners for the cost of prescription items supplied under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and later the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme. These prescription items had previously been free of charge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further proposal in this bill affects membership of the Veterans Review Board. The requirement that a proportion of the members of the Veterans Review Board be registered or licensed medical practitioners will be removed. This is consequential upon the establishment of the Repatriation Medical Authority and the Specialist Medical Review Council under the first part of the budget measures package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Repatriation Medical Authority determines questions of medical causation and prepares statements of principle. These are based on sound medical scientific evidence and exclusively state what factors related to service must exist to establish a causal connection between particular diseases, injuries or death and service. A right of appeal against certain determinations of the Repatriation Medical Authority is available to the Specialist Medical Review Council. The proposal does not affect the terms of appointment of the current medical members nor will it alter the total number of members. Persons with medical qualifications could still be appointed as ordinary members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also contains consequential amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act and other acts relating to matters dealt with in the first Act of the package. The consequential amendments relate to the payment of income support supplement, the payment of `single' rate service pension to widows, widowers and non-illness separated spouses, and the integration of Australian mariners with veterans under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, I believe that the measures presented in this Bill represent major initiatives which will help to ensure the fair and equitable delivery of repatriation benefits to veterans and their dependants. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition is not opposed to the Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill, but I must express disappointment again as to the period of time made available to me for consultation as the opposition's representative of veterans and other people affected by these decisions. It was our understanding, just a few days ago, that this bill would come on for debate in November, and we were informing the various veterans' organisations accordingly. It does create problems, which I do not think are necessary, considering that most of these measures will not be implemented until next calendar year anyway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see my role in representing the interests of veterans in this place as one of advocacy and of achieving the best result wherever possible by negotiation with the government. I think we have already proved our credentials in that regard. However, in legislation of this type there are aspects that could require reading by people of considerable experience in veterans' affairs. For example, it could be that tucked away in one of these bills is something that a person with a long experience in negotiating with the government would recognise as an issue that had been opposed in the past. I know that I need the help of people who have spent decades, in some cases, representing the interests of veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of the excellent relationship we have had on these issues to date, I say to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) that I would appreciate more time. I rushed into my party room on Monday before I had even put the matter to the shadow ministry. The party room took the attitude that we would reserve our right to introduce further amendments to this legislation in the Senate if some specific issue arose. I am not contemplating that this situation need occur but we are of the view that we must take that particular position. I have had a chance since then to talk with the various interest groups. This is the problem when bills are introduced one week and debated the next. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is my first time in the Main Committee. I argued quite passionately for its establishment because I expected that the Main Committee would avoid the outcome of guillotines and legislative log jams at the end of session. As I have said time and again, I can cop the cut in speaking time but, as a frontbencher, I cannot support a concept of being given insufficient time to consult with interest groups outside this parliament. I want to put that on the record. I advise the Main Committee that we do have one amendment which I will refer to later. This has been circulated in my name. I point out to the minister that we were only able to fax that amendment to him last night for the simple reason that we did not have adequate time. If the minister wants us to advise him of our intentions in adequate time for him to provide a response, he should recognise that more time is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the minister has given a fair interpretation of this legislation in his second reading speech. I make some remarks in that regard. It is a sensible proposition that the alignment of compensation payments&mdash;where they apply on an income related basis&mdash;is practical and fair. As the minister has pointed out, it is already in effect in other areas. It does not affect disability payments directly or people over the pension age. That is an attractive and proper situation. It is a little complex in some cases. Disability payments will be affected but there will be no effect on pensions. On most occasions, I would expect the opposite to apply. As a consequence, I hope the department makes sure that veterans are properly informed as to how this measure will apply to them. It is quite proper that, if somebody is getting compensation on the basis of another injury, they should not be able to double dip, as the minister says. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the introduction of automatic payments of funeral benefits to the estate of a veteran who is receiving extreme disablement adjustment or who was a former prisoner of war. Over time, I hope that this assistance can be expanded further. I certainly welcome the fact that it has been made automatic. It is easy to say that something is automatic but there must be some process by which the funeral director or whoever can seek this assistance. I would like the minister to explain this in his response so we can tell people the process. `Automatic' is an interesting word. If the department is not aware of someone's death, I am not sure how it can make an automatic payment. The department might not happen to read about it in the papers. The process is probably covered by administrative arrangements. I would like to know what these arrangements are so the matter can be well and truly circulated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the issue of reimbursement of costs for applicants obtaining medical evidence to present to the Veterans Review Board&mdash;a maximum amount of $425 for each condition. We welcome the government's decision. It is not a great cost. My recollection is that the estimated cost to government is about $40,000. That is very small beer when one considers that it will assist veterans who would not otherwise have the financial resources to do it. I support the minister's view that, if these matters can be resolved at the level of the VRB, that is preferable to going to the AAT, with all the associated costs of legal representation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the veterans community still have grave doubts because many of their appeal processes do not involve legal representation. We have to have faith that the VRB, the Specialist Medical Review Council and other bodies are going to be generous to veterans because they do not have legal representation in these areas. The reduction in cost, both to individual veterans and to the department, is a matter which I think should be avoided. Provided the veteran appellant is in a position to be guaranteed a fair deal, it is much better that we go down that road. I am quite willing to try to convince concerned veterans that it is an appropriate process. My efforts will be substantiated if the government ensures that if there is a doubt it comes down on the side of the veteran. That is the area of concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In making what is a quite proper decision, and for reasons that the minister has announced, I feel&mdash;and I hope that I am correct&mdash;that the government overlooked the newly established Specialist Medical Review Council, which would probably be used a lot less often than the VRB. The amendment that I have circulated in my name today seeks to give the same financial assistance to people seeking or having to obtain medical evidence to go before that Specialist Medical Review Council as to those to go before the VRB. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, that is what the provision is there for and medical evidence would obviously be the determinant. It could be that because of the significant nature of it&mdash;we are talking about something that could consequently affect a lot of other veterans&mdash;that $425 would be a minimal amount because the veteran would probably have to mount an even more substantial case in terms of arguing for an additional SOP, for instance. There may be some argument that the amount should be more, but we have suggested that whilst people appealing to the VRB would now have this financial assistance, it should be extended to those appealing to the Specialist Medical Review Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be that, under the new rules of the VRB, medical evidence may not be so necessary, simply because the SOPs are binding on the VRB&mdash;and there will be less medical debate, quite obviously. I do not actually understand how much medical evidence a veteran might still have to put before the VRB, but obviously there will be some, and it will cost the individual veteran money to obtain that advice and that report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an excellent idea to give some financial assistance, both in terms of paying for the medical advice and for any travel associated with that medical advice. As I have informed the minister, we will only move these amendments in this House. They are amendments to the act&mdash;as is the rest of this bill&mdash;and they have been inserted in the appropriate section dealing with the Specialist Medical Review Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might point out to the minister that, whilst an opposition generally cannot commit a government to expenditure, he has a one-line item in his budget of $4.671 million&mdash;which is to be found in Appropriation Bill (No. 1), under the schedule for Veterans' Affairs, division 195, item 4-03&mdash;which clearly could be applied to this purpose. So we are not asking the government to alter its budget&mdash;just to find what might be a very small amount of money when one looks at $120 billion of expenditure, to extend the government's generosity, in terms of the VRB, to applicants to the SMRC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be that the government is able to announce, prior to this matter being debated in the Senate, or even today, that it will accept our amendments and have them passed with the support of all members of the House of Representatives and/or the Senate. I foreshadow that I will move our amendments in the consideration in detail stage. That is a matter of importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note the government's intention to introduce an education entry payment to partner and carer service pensioners and income support supplement recipients. That is, as we interpret it, about $200. I am not sure that that is going to be a great help. I wholeheartedly support the concept of giving financial assistance to people to educate themselves so they can re-enter the work force. I am wondering just how much encouragement $200 might be, but it is a step in the right direction, so we are not opposing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add, in the context of educating people and getting them back into the work force, that the government, some time ago, invited here two people from Massachusetts in America. They were employees of one-time presidential aspirant Mr Michael Dukakis, in his position as governor of Massachusetts. In our terminology, the male was head of the social security department and the female, who also happened to be his wife, was head of the CES. They were brought out here to give advice on getting single parents back into the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was fortunate enough to attend a briefing they gave to interested members and staff. I was extremely disappointed, although I predicted it at the time, that the real grounds for their success&mdash;and they are internationally recognised for it&mdash;were ignored by this government. Basically, they are still ignored, notwithstanding the move to case management and things that appear in the white paper. It is something the minister, having an interest as declared here under this announcement, might like to lead his party on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the husband took over social security, he realised that he was paying a large number of people who, in fact, had university qualifications and all sorts of things but had got sidelined as single parents and could not get back into the work force, and that he had a responsibility to do something about that. What he did was ring up his wife, and a number of private agencies, and say, `I have a deal for you.' It is quite typical of the way Americans, even in a bureaucracy, manage to do business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The deal was simply this: he put a price on getting those people back into the work force in permanent employment. Whether it was his wife's department&mdash;the CES, as we would know it here&mdash;or certain approved private agencies, people would say, `Yes, I will take Joe Blow on. I will re-educate him and brush up his present qualifications, find him a job and keep him in it for whatever is the agreed period. Then you will pay me the money, as a lump sum.' It is the incentive of that that has made that scheme work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the bits and pieces that went around the periphery of that were listened to by the government. But the government ignored that fundamental: that people&mdash;even other government departments&mdash;were given a financial incentive only if they succeeded. Whether we like it or not, it is a fundamental of human nature and it is working in Massachusetts. Nevertheless, the $200 is a step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is also fair and reasonable to remove the waiting period for service pensions for refugees. The minister's arguments are quite clear there. It is a specialist area and we are presuming people are refugees who have fought in their own country, and possibly fought on our side in some particular conflict, and they should get the recognition they deserve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cessation of payments for pharmaceutical allowances for veterans who are absent from Australia for a period of 12 months or more is also supported. We are talking about $2.60 per individual or $5.20 per married couple that was provided by the government when it commenced the ever growing process of charging up-front fees on medical prescriptions that previously were issued absolutely free of charge. This fortnightly payment is aimed at compensating pensioners, on an averaging basis, for that additional cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see that as quite an appropriate measure and in fact we do not see why people who are living in another country and dealing with the pharmaceutical system that applies in that country should be receiving benefits from Australia. So we support the government in removing that benefit from people who no longer go into our pharmacies and who are acquiring pharmaceutical prescriptions anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other than the consequential amendments, the final major issue is the removal of the requirement that a proportion of the members of the Veterans Review Board be registered or licensed medical practitioners. This makes sense. We now have the Repatriation Medical Authority. We have the binding of the VRB to its statement of principles. The idea of certain members of the board turning to someone else and saying, `Well, has that medical evidence got any standing', because they as lay persons would not know, is no longer necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are tied to the SOPs and we hope by the time they have passed the parliament they will be concise and reasonably understandable, so there is no reason to have specialist type people on the VRB. I note that the minister points out some will probably remain as ordinary members and that makes sense, but over the years if we do not need these people and others can do the job equally well, then why not have them there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not got any serious concerns that I am aware of in any of those issues. Having a few minutes left, I might point out to the minister that he may at some time in the future&mdash;and the recent Agent Orange arrangement highlights this&mdash;find that he is very grateful to the coalition for putting forward the amendment to which he agreed, to create an appeal provision in the Specialist Medical Review Council. I say that because we have a classic example here of evidence coming forward to the minister of a change in medical opinion on the effects of herbicides, in this case Agent Orange, for causal effects in terms of a present medical condition of veterans, and in this case, those who were in the Vietnam war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that by creating the Repatriation Medical Authority the minister is no longer able to make a commitment to veterans to the effect that he will fix it. All he or any future minister can do is refer that medical evidence to the RMA and ask it to make a decision. I cannot see how else it will work because it has to come down with a statement of principle and, if the minister is going to overrule it on those sorts of things, then we might ask what it is doing. Why not just write the statement of principles in the minister's office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There might be some little legal remedy there that gets around it but I doubt that the minister should use it if he is going to stand by what he did. The simple fact is that a person has the right to appeal to the Specialist Medical Review Council that we created. As I see it, one could probably put the two professors who wrote the report on that particular Specialist Medical Review Council because that is wide open to appointments from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said to the minister at the time, we might be just saving him from himself. I am quite happy to repeat that remark but I am also prepared to say that the minister and his office gave us the maximum cooperation in considering that matter and it was resolved in the proper way in the interests of veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the minister, in concluding, that I want to take this opportunity to mention representations I received recently. I do not want to mention the person's name, but I will naturally provide it to the minister. I have had drawn to my attention the psychological effect that PTSD has on veterans. The problems associated with it are a matter that the minister is concerned about. I am concerned about it. I am also concerned about the attitudes of others whom I consulted this week about how we should deal with people with psychological problems. The out-sourcing that has gone on in recent times, particularly at state level, has gone too far. I cannot stand up as an expert with solutions, but institutionalisation has received a lot of criticism. On the other hand, to throw some of these people out on the street without proper support is equally bad, in my mind. When I had this case drawn to my attention, it really did worry me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The person I am talking about enlisted in World War II at the age of 14. He then went away as a soldier, and later served in Korea and Vietnam. He is now in an advanced stage of all sorts of illnesses, including Huntington's syndrome, but is required to continue living at home, presumably with the assistance of his daughter. He has organic brain disease, renal failure and PTSD muscle spasms, and is being harassed by the police. According to my advice, he is a prisoner in his own home because when he walks outside he worries people. He possibly does do violent things on the street. He has had restraining orders put upon him. His neighbours belittle him and, apparently, have told him to go back in the house and die. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a pretty sad case. I want to put it on the record, not in any form of criticism, but because something has got to be done. I will hand his name and address to the minister. He has been in and out of the courts and I am not saying he did not do something that the broader community would say is wrong. Apparently he is seriously ill, having given service in all the areas I have mentioned. He is now aged 67, and I think we need to investigate the matter in order to help this person in what might be his remaining months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the minister for taking note of this matter. I know I will get a response. I think it is sufficiently serious to raise in this place. When the information was put before me, it really got me down. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I am particularly pleased to have this opportunity to rise in support of the Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). Issues of importance to our veterans community are about to gain an added impetus at the Australian remembrance campaign next year when matters of concern to veterans will be highlighted. It is timely that we are talking about veterans issues with this particular bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill proposes a number of amendments necessary to implement the second stage of the budget package for the veterans' affairs portfolio. Members will be well acquainted with the broad range of measures which the budget brought down to improve things for veterans. The initiatives contained in the budget, and in this bill, have been developed to address the most pressing needs of ex-servicemen and women, war widows and widowers, and their dependants. The package responds in a real way to the issues raised by the Baume committee and other groups with respect to problems of older veterans of the two world wars, and the problems of younger veterans of more recent conflicts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the budget, the RSL National President, Major General `Digger' James, endorsed the Veterans' Affairs package. It is fair to say that the RSL and Labor governments have not always seen eye-to-eye in the past&mdash;and still do not, on certain issues&mdash;but the reception of the budget package is due in no small way to the role of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) in gaining the support of the veterans community and its peak bodies. I congratulate him on his efforts since becoming minister. He was actually in my electorate on business on Friday of last week, and he visited the Amberley RAAF base to have a look around there. He spoke about some things for the Australian remembrance campaign next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was good enough to give up his time to meet with three of my veteran constituents&mdash;very important people in our community. I would like to say something about these three particular people. They are actually from the Veterans Support and Advocacy Service, which is located in Inala, in the electorate of the honourable member for Rankin (Mr Beddall). They come from three different areas and I will speak of them in a minute. The secretary, of course, is from my own electorate. I would like to take the opportunity to formally place on the record my appreciation to the minister for giving up his time last week to meet with these three veterans, who are actually Vietnam veterans, and with the other Ipswich veterans he met earlier this year when he visited the electorate not long after being given the portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the Goodna RSL Club was the first place that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs actually visited after becoming minister. He went over particularly well, and sat and spoke with members of our veteran community, and they were very pleased. The three gentlemen to whom I referred a moment ago as having spoken to the minister last week are Brian Evans, who lives in Ipswich in my electorate; Paul McPhee, who lives in the electorate of the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull); and Brett Kriewaldt, the president of the association, who lives in the electorate of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), who is the honourable member for Dickson. All three gentlemen are very keen to get involved in the Australian remembrance campaign next year, and I look forward to their contribution. Brian will certainly be involved in my own local electorate, and Paul and Brett in the electorates of the members I referred to before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Veterans Support and Advocacy Service has been centralised very much on the needs of Vietnam veterans. I remember that Brian Evans came to see me some time ago, before he was involved with this particular service. He was certainly someone who was very severely affected by the stress of the war. It is only since he has become involved with the service that he has come out of that. It has been a great transformation to see Brian become such a great worker for his fellow veterans. He is doing a tremendous job. I would like to put that on the record, because it really goes to show how the support that people can get from one another helps so much, and his is a real case in point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the minister's visit to my electorate last week, he discussed a range of issues with the members from the Veterans Support and Advocacy Service, issues which are important to all members of the veterans community and not just to the Vietnam veterans. They do not distinguish between them: a veteran is a veteran, as far as the service is concerned, no matter what conflict the veteran was involved in. The service provides a much-needed focal point for veterans in the whole Ipswich-Inala region. It is particularly the younger veterans that these people concentrate on. They have already gained much from the budget measures, and that is why I mentioned Brian Evans's own stress related problems before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The post-traumatic stress disorder package introduced earlier this year was covered by the Baume committee. It was certainly welcomed very much by the whole veterans community, and was an innovative package that I was particularly pleased about, since there are quite a number of Vietnam veterans in my own electorate who will benefit from that $20.6 million over four years. Anyone who has been dealing with sufferers of this condition knows how demoralising it can be, both to the sufferer and to his or her family. That is something that we all, as members of parliament, can look at with very much a bipartisan attitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that most members of the House have dealings with the whole range of veterans, including Vietnam veterans, and that they see these problems for themselves. I welcome the initiative, which includes funding for the PTSD treatment centres, more resources for the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service, and money for research into the specific health problems of younger veterans&mdash;such as the Agent Orange problem which the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) talked about before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill adds to that excellent package of reform measures. It is certainly wide in its scope, but I would like to concentrate on a few areas in the time allocated to me today. Firstly, the bill will amend the act to align the treatment of compensation payments received by service pensioners with the way in which compensation payment recipients of comparable social security payments are treated under the Social Security Act. At the moment, compensation payments to service pensioners are treated in a number of ways. Periodic payments of compensation are treated as income for the purposes of the ordinary income test. Lump sum compensation payments are held as an asset of the person, and any income derived from that asset is then treated as ordinary income for the purposes of the ordinary income test. If people receive compensation and part of that compensation is made for loss of earnings or loss of capacity to earn, they are not entitled to a service pension in addition to the compensation payment they have already received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing to note here is that veterans are not looking for handouts or special charity provisions. I can safely say that the veterans in my electorate, and in the broader community, are the sort of people who like to think of themselves as members of the community who pull their weight in our society. They are people who have really pulled their weight more than many others in our community, so I do not think too many of them would disagree with this amendment which rationalises and streamlines the veterans entitlements process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other amendments deals with the income support supplement, known as ISS, which was also introduced with the budget measures this year. The bill aims to extend the ISS to war widows or widowers who are caring for severely handicapped persons. This is another compassionate and worthwhile initiative for veterans and their dependants. We should remember that wars are fought not only on the battlefields but also in the homes of Australia&mdash;by the wives and families who are left behind. That is something that we will remember very much, I believe, in 1995 in the Australia Remembers program. It is really the families who are very severely affected. The wives, families and children are all very much affected by war and need to have a lot of assistance and compassion afforded to them. Those who were left behind when their loved ones served their country overseas are those important people we speak about, and I do not think there are too many people in this country who have not been affected in some small way by those sorts of situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of voluntary caring work in our society is done by women&mdash;I think we all know that&mdash;and it is something that should always be acknowledged whenever possible in this place. This extension of income support supplement is targeted at them, and rightly so. Caring for a handicapped or elderly person is one of the most selfless tasks one human being can perform for another, but it is also one of the most demanding. When we talk to people who are affected in this way, when we see an older couple where a male veteran is deteriorating in his later years, it is very often the wife who is giving a lot of that support that he needs. Women are the unsung heroes of many of our conflicts. Their physical and emotional reserves are called upon every day to face the challenge of caring for people who are sometimes terribly afflicted. I am very pleased that this initiative is being introduced in National Carers Week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ISS itself was another of the excellent reforming initiatives contained in the original legislation earlier this year. As members may remember, it will be introduced in March next year. The change will affect widows and widowers who, in addition to their war widows or widowers pension, also receive additional income support payments from the Department of Social Security. Before the legislation was introduced, widows and widowers have had to collect this pension through DSS, but under new plans introduced by the minister they will receive the income support supplement directly from the Department of Veterans' Affairs. This will no doubt make life a lot easier for recipients, and it will certainly make life simpler for the group of people who will be regarded as eligible for the ISS. The payment will be paid at the same rate as the social security payment, and veterans entitled to the payment who wish to continue to receive their payment through the Department of Social Security may elect to do so. The ISS initiative has been warmly received by the ex-service community in general and the War Widows Guild in particular. It is estimated that nearly 54,000 war widows and widowers will elect to transfer this payment from DSS to Veterans' Affairs, and I am sure life will be a lot easier and simpler for them as a result of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also seeks to extend the education entry payment to ISS recipients. Education entry payments are made to some pensioners to help them further their education and thus enhance their job prospects. The payment is an annual grant made to assist with the costs of enrolling in a course of study. The amendments provide that partner and carer service pensioners may be paid an education entry payment in certain circumstances, namely, if they are below pension age and if they are qualified to receive pensioner education supplement under the Austudy scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important to realise that education is becoming a commodity more valuable than anyone could have imagined even 20 years ago and that it is not restricted to younger people; older people can benefit from the new technologies as well and that is something we really should focus a lot more on. In today's world of rapidly changing technology everyone should have access to the means to stay well informed and up to date. Education is the best way to do this, and that goes for the veteran community as well as everyone else.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not always elderly people either but people around the age of the minister and me&mdash;we do not really call ourselves elderly at this stage but it certainly affects a lot of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many elderly people would have been denied opportunities that the present generation of tertiary students has come to take for granted. One of the best ways of encouraging a healthy retirement is to have an interest that exercises the body and the mind. The number of mature age students at universities these days is proof of that and should be very welcome. However, many older veterans and dependants would encounter some difficulty in enrolling in tertiary courses because of the cost factor. This amendment will help this group of people and should be welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment is timely, coming as it does two days after the Creative Nation statement presented by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) earlier this week, which has been well received across the nation. It contained many initiatives in the field of technological education. We all realise the importance of having access to, and an understanding of, the technology that is already transforming our world and will change it further in the years to come. It should not be seen as merely a young person's preserve. The elderly need to know about community services, government programs and anything else that the information highway will contain, so they will need to know how to use this sort of technology as well as their grandchildren do. It is amazing how people can respond to that new technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to have had the opportunity to support this legislation today this Main Committee room with its closeness and friendliness. I support the bill and commend it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendment foreshadowed by the shadow minister, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and hope that, sensible as it is, it will be acceptable to the government. It is entirely consistent with the main thrust of the legislation and therefore should not be objectionable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of matters in the legislation are commendable and seem to be raising no objections from the veterans community. The only overall objection&mdash;that I assume the honourable member has referred to in his speech, which I, unfortunately, was not here for&mdash;is that the legislation has been brought in too quickly. I hesitate to suggest that it is being rushed through because there is no apparent reason to rush it through for the sake of hiding anything. In the end, the benefits for veterans ought to be in place as soon as possible and, after all, the legislation implements some of the budget decisions. The shadow minister would have made it clear that we may see fit to move some further amendments in the Senate in due course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is intended that compensation recovery payments such as accident, sickness and workers compensation payments received by service pensioners and income support supplement recipients be aligned with the way in which compensation payments received by recipients of comparable social security payments are treated under the Social Security Act. This matter raises some general concerns about the treatment of veterans. I have not heard the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) speak about this particular case but I have heard him argue on other occasions for this sort of treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, this raises the spectre of a constant attempt to break down the special status of veterans as a distinct group of people. Whilst in this case it may be unobjectionable, and there may well be some arguments for doing it, I make the general statement that this is a concern and that it has happened consistently. I argued against it most recently when the government brought in legislation, not so long ago, to bring the treatment of shares that were owned by pensioners into line with the treatment of shares that were owned by social security beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point again that over time we are increasingly seeing this alignment. There is a concern in the veterans community, which the minister will be aware of, because I know that it is widely expressed, that over time the status of veterans will be diminished. There will come a time&mdash;and it may well be that the time when it does come will be the right time&mdash;when veterans' entitlements may be totally consumed into the wider social security network. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not by any means advocating that this should occur, although, realistically, some decades down the track the movement to do that will gather momentum. But in the meantime there is a very strong view among those in the veterans community that their affairs ought to be separate; that their benefits are always to be seen as compensation, not welfare; and that therefore the attempt, at every opportunity, to align veterans benefits with social security benefits per se is a concern, even though it may be supported by equity, or by some other arguments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make this point because whenever veterans affairs are debated in this parliament, I make a plea for those in the veterans community that their entitlements and benefits be seen in that very special light, and that their special status in the community be safeguarded, and in no way downgraded. I only do that because there are widely held suspicions, despite the current minister's obvious commitment to his role. Perhaps veterans become a little irrational about their concerns&mdash;but they do so with some justification, because over the years there have been furphies about scrapping the Department of Veterans' Affairs and about lots of other things that would be of great concern to veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commitment to maintain a ministry of veterans' affairs is very important. In practice, that means that ultimately there is a very high level of commitment by governments of both persuasions to veterans' affairs, by the maintenance of that distinct department. It will be a sad day&mdash;and, as I say, it will probably come many years down the track&mdash;when there will not be the definite need for a separate department, but there is a need at present, and there will be for a long period of time to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, in relation to compensation recovery, there were a couple of questions that the minister might address. The answers may be evident, but I am not aware of them. I assume that when compensation recovery happens, any compensation payments received subsequently would be affected by the new mechanism. I am not sure whether there is any retrospective element to this. If people have received compensation payments in the past and they are receiving benefits, I would assume that arrangement is not affected at all, but maybe that is part of the alignment. Perhaps the answer to that question lies in the way that those sorts of awards are treated by the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question about the actual timing of all of this obviously would be of concern to veterans and I think needs to be answered. I did receive, and I draw it to the minister's attention, a magazine article headed `A thorny problem attacked: section 74 Veteran's Entitlements Act'. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since 1972 the Regular Serviceman has had the right to claim benefits under both the Commonwealth's compensation legislation and the Veteran's Entitlements legislation for the same service caused impairment/disability or incapacity to work. How this curious state of affairs came about is another subject. Where a serviceman has exercised rights and received benefits under both pieces of legislation for the same injury, one or the other benefit must be repaid. Section 74 VE Act provides the mechanism and it does not do a brilliant job.</PARA>
<PARA>This raises the spectre of how confusing a lot of these entitlements and the interpretation of these entitlements have become. In all of these schemes, not only those for veterans and social security, it is instructive to hear the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) in the parliament trying to explain some of the government's so-called initiatives and to deal with the anomalies and the unintended consequences. I will not get too side-tracked, but the general principle is that everything seems so complicated. This article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The compensatory principles differ. Commonwealth Compensation compensates by periodic (fortnightly) payments for incapacity to work, or by lump sum award for impairment/disablement, or both. Veterans' Entitlements compensates by DVA pension (fortnightly) which is generally for impairment/disability up to 100 per cent General Rate and incapacity to work at Intermediate and Special (TPI) rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of combinations that can arise are many and complicated.</PARA>
<PARA>The article outlined one situation:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The serviceman was granted a DVA pension in 1982 and then in 1984 he was awarded lump sum compensation. Section 74(3) `deemed' that the 1984 lump sum award was to be treated as if it were paid in fortnightly payments over the actuarial life (life expectancy) of the man as determined by the Australian Government Actuary. The 1984 award was also `deemed' to have been paid to him in 1982 when the grant of DVA pension was made. The man's actuarial life was calculated on his age in 1982 giving his life expectancy to the year 2003 inclusive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the result, the lump sum award was spread out as fortnightly `deemed' payments from 1982 to 2003 inclusive and deducted from his pension payments. When the lump sum was awarded in 1984 the sum of the `deemed' payments from 1982 pension date to 1984 award date was deducted from the award. The balance of the award or the `over-payment' was paid over to the man with the intention of being recovered by deduction of the `deemed' payments from future fortnightly pension. On a dollar-for-dollar basis though complicated this sounds fair enough but, it was not on such basis. Section 74(3) said more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Actuary also had to make the sum of all the `deemed' payments equivalent to (not equal to) the 1984 award `deemed' made in 1982. This required the Actuary to employ present value principles and the problem gets sticky.</PARA>
<PARA>That just illustrates the complications which are faced by people. I assume that that sort of scenario is something that is being addressed in part by this legislation. But all of this deeming that we went through and all the problems that it created, all the unintended consequences, really make life difficult for veterans and their spouses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make that point because I feel strongly that their lives ought to be uncomplicated, particularly those of the older veterans. By and large, younger veterans are still able to take care of themselves, but many of the older veterans cannot. They come to see me. They sit in front of me&mdash;and some of them are in their 80s&mdash;and they tell me how they are being harassed, or how they have concerns. Some of those concerns are rational, some perhaps are not so rational. However, my heart goes out to them every time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is easy for me to say, `The government or the department or whatever should leave you alone to get on with your life.' Their life expectancy is not very long when we are talking about veterans of the Second World War or even the Korean war. They are getting old. They ought not be harassed. They ought not have their lives made difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sometimes a cost is involved in making those decisions. I do not want to get into an argument about whether the mechanisms are reasonable or not. The point is, once veterans have reached a certain age, it is unrealistic and unreasonable to fight them to the nth degree and to complicate their lives. I assume that that will be the result of this. The existing situation that I have just outlined is complicated enough. It will continue to be so, and yet I do not believe it should be. The government spends heaps of money on all sorts of things. Every day in the parliament we hear members of the government talking about a million dollars for this and a few million dollars for that. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just throw my hands up in the air, and in the end I come down on the side of, in particular, the older veterans. At some point in time they should be given everything they are entitled to&mdash;using that term fairly loosely. We should be saving money in the areas of government waste, extravagance and vote buying exercises. We see them every day of the week in the parliament, and yet the government wants to be hard on veterans. It does not make sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point was raised about expenses incurred by applicants to the VRB. Although the cost of medical evidence is reimbursed, under the provisions of the VEA and at the AAT those costs can be met through legal aid grants. I am sure the minister is aware&mdash;and I do not know what his reaction to this will be&mdash;that there are many ex-service advocates who do a wonderful job for veterans. I assume that most of the time they are not paid, and apparently the same facility is not available to them if they are advocating for someone to have medical costs reimbursed in the same way as they are through legal aid. I suppose there is a technical problem there. Legal aid can be quantified more easily, but there would be no cost to the government in looking at that sort of facility. In fact, there would be savings in legal aid where these people are being represented by ex-service advocates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had discussions with a number of veterans' organisations about most of these issues, as I said at the outset.

I understood that the whips got together and, if they worked out there was no controversy involved, the legislation came here. I presumed that appropriate notice would be given. At the end of the day, there are specific measures in this bill&mdash;for instance, the compensation measure, which was mentioned by my colleague the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford)&mdash;that are not retrospective; the bill comes into effect from 1 January 1995. The other chamber needs to have these measures before it in order to consider them by a certain time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This lack of time was more to do with those procedures than with any intention on my part not to give my friend the chance to have a look at it. I certainly say to the honourable member for O'Connor that, if there is a way of giving him more time with the legislation, I would be more than happy to do that. In future, we will try to give him extra time. It was not an intended constraint. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is part of a package of measures that we announced in the budget. This did not go through in the first budget measures bill simply because we were not able to get everything up and ready in time. These provisions are mostly beneficial provisions and they were part of a package which was absolutely and exhaustively gone through with the ex-service communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for O'Connor also talked about the automatic payment of the funeral benefits. At the moment, the class of person covered has to apply for that funeral benefit. Such people will no longer have to apply; we will pay it automatically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are administrative procedures in place. For instance, the ex-service community always looks at the death notices and these sorts of things. The ex-service community is very good when it comes to this. In most cases, particularly if people are receiving an extreme disabled adjustment and if they are in the other class as well, the ex-prisoner of war class, everyone knows who they are and someone is on to us very quickly. In the event that we miss one, people are chased until we are finally notified. I take the point that the honourable member makes and I understand what he is saying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to appeals, I am concerned that there are too many appeals which, at the end, are granted anyway. One of the major reasons that we brought this in as part of the package of measures was to make sure that we get people to bring their medical evidence not only at Veterans Review Board level but also at the primary level. The way it works now is that those who go to the primary level usually do not think they have got a chance anyway so they turn up without appropriate information. They then go to the Veterans Review Board and do the same thing because, if they win, they get something for their medical reports&mdash;and we all know medical reports can be very expensive. If they lose, they get nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Normally, they keep the powder dry, so to speak, until they go to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, where a veteran can get automatic legal aid for these matters. They wait for that. What happens? My colleagues the lawyers make plenty of money out of it. Frankly, I would prefer to spend that money that my department is spending at the AAT on the veterans themselves rather than on lawyers, and I say that as a lawyer myself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now say that, whenever veterans go to the Veterans Review Board, we will give them up to $425 for each medical report on a separate condition. I believe that will mean that the advocates will come forward with that report. Hopefully, if it is going to be accepted, it is accepted there and then. It cuts out delays; it cuts out costs. Probably delay is the major thing. At the end of the day, if a veteran wins, he or she wins and gets paid from the date of making the application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say a few things about the Specialist Medical Review Council and the amendment that has been proposed by the honourable member for O'Connor. As far as today is concerned, I am ruling it out; I am not prepared to accept it and I will tell him why. I have very good reasons for that. The point is that the Specialist Medical Review Council will not be hearing individual cases. I do not expect that there will be that many appeals to the Specialist Medical Review Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I discussed this quite cooperatively with the shadow spokesman I took into consideration the fact that this would not happen often. Nevertheless, I was happy to acknowledge that that could be the case, that there would be certain times when there would be medical conditions when the Repatriation Medical Authority would say, `No, we are not prepared to put it into a statement of principle'. Therefore, we would give the opportunity to an individual or an ex-service organisation to go to the Specialist Medical Review Council. But that basically is a medical thing. The council is not going to handle individual cases; it is looking at causations, it is looking at medical principles&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6J4">Mr SCIACCA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, they have to get medical advice but the sort of medical advice that they would have to get will be different from what this sort of payment is being introduced for. The rationale behind this payment is to make sure that we cut down delays to veterans, to make sure that they come with all the appropriate information to the Veterans Review Board so that we can cut down delays and cut down costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would envisage that for those who do appeal to the Specialist Medical Review Council&mdash;and I would expect that that would be a very limited number of cases&mdash;it would be more of a doctor and doctor sort of thing. For instance, an ex-service organisation might take up the case on behalf of a veteran. I would see that that would be the way it would work. Someone would take up the case because it is really a class of people that is appealing against a particular medical principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would expect that that sort of case would be such that paying $425 for a medical report would neither be here nor there in the sense that it really would not be of any great assistance. This $425 is specifically meant to help the individual veteran who has to be able to prove that he has a case, that he has a particular disease. It will not really matter as long as the statement of principle says, for instance, that smoking causes lung cancer. All that individual has to prove is that, firstly, he has got lung cancer and, secondly, that he has smoked. He has got to get a doctor to say that in his opinion he has got lung cancer because he smoked. It is not that the doctor's report will be in terms of a statement of principle referring it back to that; it is connecting the disease or the injury to the particular principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the good intentions of the honourable member for O'Connor in suggesting this but I just do not believe that it is anything that is going to be of any real benefit and perhaps we might leave this to the Senate later on to discuss. I certainly will not accept it now, not because I am against the principle of it but because I just do not think it is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make another point which I think is very important. The honourable member for O'Connor mentioned that we should thank members of the opposition because of the fact that they asked us to agree to a Specialist Medical Review Council in the event that there were statements of principles that come out of the Medical Review Authority which we did not agree on. I think, if I remember correctly, that he put out a press release shortly after I made the announcement on the Agent Orange extension range of cancers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought about it. I was tempted to whip one out and say, `Wrong, Mr Tuckey', but I said, `No'. I considered that the honourable member for O'Connor and I have been getting on well when it comes to cooperating on these bills and so I decided that I do not particularly want to stick it into him. But I want to tell him now, given that he mentioned it&mdash;I was not going to mention it&mdash;that one of the major reasons why I baulked originally about the setting up of the Specialist Medical Review Council was that there already is in the act&mdash;it was part of my bill&mdash;a section that there would always be that residual power of the Repatriation Commission to overrule any statement of principle of the Repatriation Medical Authority provided that that overruling procedure would be in favour of the veteran. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case, the Repatriation Commission has referred to the Repatriation Medical Authority, for the compiling of statement of principles, these extensions of the five new cancers that we are now going to accept as a result of the reports from Professors MacLennan and Smith. In the event, that the Repatriation Medical Authority says, `No, we do not agree'&mdash;and I think that is quite unlikely but it is a possibility&mdash;we do not have to wait. I have already made the commitment on behalf of the government that we are going to do this quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no way in the world that we are going to wait until someone arranges to appeal this to the Specialist Medical Review Council. It will go straight back to the Repatriation Commission. It was the one that had accepted that extension and referred it to the RMA. It has the power immediately to say, `In this case, because it is such an important groundbreaking issue, as far as we are concerned it is in favour of the veteran. We have the power to do that.' I think it is in section 108A of the act&mdash;or certainly of the last bill that I brought in which set up the Repatriation Medical Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I am making to my honourable friend is that it is already there. I hope he has more regard for my ability than to think I was going to get up and make a public statement knowing full well that there was some chance that I was going to get knocked back by the Repatriation Medical Authority. I can assure him that that will not be the case. I did not want to make an issue of it. I thought it was a bit complicated. I said, `We are getting on well with these matters' and I said, `I do not think we will do that'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate that we are at one when it comes to looking after the general interests of the veterans. It is my belief that I should do the best I can. It is his belief that he should be the advocate. I accept that. I think that is the proper role when dealing with a portfolio like this. There is no politics in veterans affairs. They deserve, I think, a bit better than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member mentioned a particular PTSD case. I thank him for referring that case to me. I have the details in my pocket and I will certainly take it up. I appreciate his doing that. That is an area which I am very interested in. It is an area in which we are spending a lot of money. Only recently, I officially opened a PTSD specialist centre at Heidelberg Hospital under the directorship of Professor Philip Morris. We are getting treatment protocols from the United States and other places. We are getting as much information as we can. PTSD is real. It is something which cannot be cured. It can only be treated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are trying to do is organise treatment protocols. We are going to diffuse those throughout the states through the St John of God Hospital in New South Wales and through our veterans advice networks and Vietnam veterans counselling services. The honourable member for O'Connor mentioned how Vietnam veterans in particular have this problem and end up with all sorts of social problems as a result. That is something which we are not only going to look at, but do something about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It took a long time for the Australian public to realise the specific problems suffered by people involved in that conflict. I did a television interview yesterday in which it was suggested to me that perhaps the government was being generous in extending the benefits in terms of Agent Orange to five new sets of cancers. This particular interviewer suggested that in real terms there is no conclusive link between exposure to herbicides and certain cancers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said to him, `Look, the report that I received from Professors MacLennan and Smith said that in their opinion there was, but that in any event the government should give them the benefit of the doubt. In the context of the generous nature of the repatriation system in this country'&mdash;and it is one of the best in the world, and there are a lot of people trying to get on board from allied countries who cannot&mdash;`we have given them the benefit of the doubt.' I continued, `If you think about it, we sent 50,000 people over to that conflict. When they returned, the majority of the people over here were against the war'&mdash;and I was one of them, and I have said as much publicly&mdash;`and they were brought back in the middle of the night.

I told the interviewer that if at the end of the day we could do something to ease their minds and let them know that we were thinking of them, so be it; I was prepared to give them the benefit of the doubt. I do not think honourable members would disagree with that action that we took.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for McPherson mentioned the hassles that older veterans have, and I accept that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also assure the honourable member for McPherson that there is certainly no thought by this government of getting rid of, or in any way dissolving, the Department of Veterans' Affairs. It is quite the contrary. In fact, everything we are doing is the other way around. We are taking away from Social Security the war widow income supplement; DVA is going to pay it as of and from 30 March next year. The single rate of pension to service pension widows will now come over to our department whereas, in the past, if they stayed with our department they got only half the married rate.

<PARA>I remind the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) that we always understood that this was a matter of notice in this chamber rather than one of lengthy debate and one of division. We expected that it should be on notice here so that it could be further considered in the Senate. Accepting the point he makes that there is a difference, it probably only highlights the fact that $425 is not enough. As to whether the resources of the RSL should be diminished by taking a proper action before the Specialist Medical Review Council, having had the submission that veterans need some financial assistance to prepare medical evidence for the VRB, I support the rationale the minister has proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that, whilst I accept it could be a class action, it could be all sorts of other things. The actual decision will be totally built around medical evidence. I assume that the applicant will be arguing either that the RMA has excluded a particular causal condition that should have been included in the statements of principles, or that one of them is wrong. In those circumstances, substantial medical evidence has got to be brought together and collected, and that is going to cost. It might be that an individual is the applicant, and, in that case, is not defined as a group. It could be an individual veteran, notwithstanding the broader outcome, or else it could be an organisation or a group of veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In each case, having accepted the principle that there is reason to assist people with the costs associated with gaining medical evidence, and having accepted that, as in the VRB, there are no legal costs before the Specialist Medical Review Council&mdash;we agreed on that and made sure that people did not have that worry, since this is all about medical evidence&mdash;there is a very good case to give them some money. By the time the bill gets to the Senate, the minister may have considered just how much money that might be, in terms of an individual case. I agree with the minister entirely, but I do not think there will be many cases. Therefore, whilst we might be generous in terms of a particular application, we would not be imposing any great cost on the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out that the minister's estimate of $425 associated with appeals to the VRB is expected to cost $40,000. I would not be surprised if, over time, the average cost for our proposal were half that. It is not a lot of money for government but for individuals trying to get before the Specialist Medical Review Council it could be a fortune&mdash;and a fortune they may not have. As I said, it might be a sub-branch of the RSL that feels very strongly on behalf of a member in this regard and, as we would know, RSLs generally do not have any substantial resources. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This small portfolio bill contains three amendments to Veterans' Affairs benefits. Its major purpose is to increase the age at which female veterans can qualify for age service pension. The bill also contains two other minor measures&mdash;an increase in the maximum rate of the dependent child add-on which is payable to service pensioners for children under the age of 16 years, and the reintroduction of advance pharmaceutical allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to increase the qualifying age for women receiving age pension from the Department of Social Security and age service pension from the Department of Veterans' Affairs was part of the government's 1993 Budget. Legislation giving effect to this proposal for Social Security age pensions has already been passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase in the qualifying age will be slowly phased in with the first adjustment occurring on 1 July 1995. This bill proposes that from 1 July 1995 the qualifying age for age service pension for female veterans will be 55 1/2 years. Thereafter, the qualifying age will increase by six months every two years. It will not be until the year 2014 that the age service pension age for women will be 60 years. The qualifying age for women will then be the same as the existing qualifying age for men. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second initiative is also part of the 1993 Budget. The maximum rate of additional family payment paid by Social Security was increased by $1 per week for each child under 16 years of age. This decision was part of a package to assist low income earners and unemployed persons to offset increases in the wholesale tax announced in that year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Child related payments paid to service pensioners are matched to the rate of Social Security additional family payment. This measure will ensure that the rates continue to be matched by providing that a similar increase will apply to service pensioners with dependent children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final initiative relates to the reinstatement of the payment of advance pharmaceutical allowance. Advance pharmaceutical allowance was paid to chronically ill pensioners with a high volume of prescription drug use. The advance payment was made from 1991 to 1993. Payments ceased from 1 January 1994 as a result of the operation of a sunset clause. A proposal was included in the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993 to extend the sunset clause for a further year. This bill failed to become operative due to the Senate's refusal to pass the bill in its original form. The disagreement of the Senate was not related to advance pharmaceutical allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initiative in the current bill is to re-introduce advance pharmaceutical allowance payments from 1 January 1995 without the inclusion of a sunset clause. This will ensure that the availability of the advance will be an ongoing benefit to veterans and their dependants. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

They are very specific measures for which I do not anticipate any opposition. Nevertheless, having said that and having been very moderate in my earlier remarks, I have to point out to the chamber some of the politics associated with these particular measures because they do the government no credit. The bill could almost be called the bill of broken promises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, I want to talk about the government's hypocrisy in bringing again to the parliament its arrangements to increase the retirement age at which women become eligible for, in this case, the service pension. I note that the government has maintained the differential between service pensioners and normal public pensioners of five years. I endorse that, naturally, but we have to look at the history of this matter. It stems from the 1993 Budget when the House was informed that women generally live longer than men and that their participation in the labour force and level of wages could be expected to further increase. We were told that raising the pension age would reduce the likelihood of women being forced to retire at 60 as there would no longer be an expectation that women could claim the age pension at this age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is, of course, something that we did not oppose because, in the context of everything we did at the last election, we put it on the table. We let the voters know what our position was. They rejected us on some of those matters and this, no doubt, was one of them, particularly when we look at what the government had to say about our position prior to the last election.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the sort of thing that was said, in this case by the then Minister for Social Security, Dr Blewett:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The lower pension age for women is due recognition of the fact that many older women devoted most of their lives to their families and sacrificed employment, savings and superannuation in the process. When women of pension age have had similar opportunities to their male counterparts, that will be the time to equalise pension ages, not before.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the government's position before the election. I have just read what it said in the first budget after the election. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is worse than that because Dr Blewett went on with the dreadful situation that occurred during the election, when the truth was just slaughtered day after day. What did he say? Dr Blewett described the coalition's policies as `premature, ill-considered, extremely harsh and unfair'. I know he has gone, but how can we be dealing with this matter? It was brought in by this government, not ours? We stated our position; we are clear. That is why we are not opposing the bill; we are not going to be hypocrites. But it is time that it was drawn to the attention of those opposite how they played that election and how they played the people&mdash;not us. It is nice to say, `We beat you again.' It is not a cricket match; it is not a footy match. It is a case of the people who got dealt to and the people were very put out about it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Do not make jokes about it because we are talking about that. Do the opinion polls say that people think the government was honest in the last election? No, they do not. When Jim Short, the then opposition finance spokesman, claimed that the government had a similar policy, Dr Blewett denied this emphatically. He went on to claim that this policy&mdash;our policy, the policy that the government is implementing here today&mdash;would see women in their 40s and 50s having to alter their retirement plans drastically. For many, it would mean a substantial loss of income and late age entry into the unemployment queues. If that was the case then, those opposite should tell us what is different today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has had some embarrassment about this and its solution was to form a caucus committee. I would not be at all surprised if the member for Bass (Mrs Silvia Smith) is a member of it. It was set up to investigate the possibility of reversing this decision. That was the first one, when the government brought in its social security measures. If that caucus committee wants a message from government, from the executive, it has it today. But what hypocrisy to be running a caucus committee that is supposed to be considering the reversal of the original piece of legislation when, here today, we have a piece of legislation that extends that age determination to people in receipt of veterans pensions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the member for Bass does not get up and say how she is still fighting for these people, because, obviously, she is not. If she had a personal commitment, she has been rolled. The simple fact is that we do not want any of that hypocrisy, and this is an exercise in hypocrisy. The honourable member can say, `Go look at the polls,' but it does not change the simple fact that I stand here as a representative of the people you are affecting too. Those opposite sold them a bill of goods. We did not, and we are not going to reverse our position and be hypocrites in taking the political opportunities that would arise from going out and kicking hell out of members of the government on this issue, as they kicked hell out of us on that occasion. The difference is that we can both sleep at night but for different reasons. The government has no sense, no feeling. It is an outrageous situation that a government could go to the people, as it did, on this and other issues and, in fact, reverse its position immediately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third item in this particular area increases the maximum rate of additional family payment by $1 a week. Why did the government do that? Because it broke another promise: the no tax promise; the l-a-w promise. The government dumped a substantial amount of cost of living increases on the community. It realised it put certain lower income groups in such poverty that it had to do something about it. The government increased the additional family payment by $1 to try to compensate at least some of the community. The government then</PARA>
<PARA>dumped 5c a litre petrol increase on this group of people as most of them were still driving cars using leaded fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not oppose what the government is doing. Both of those issues that have been addressed today are compensation for a broken promise. This was a promise that many Australians did not receive and many Australians just had to pay the money. One of these compensations may appear generous&mdash;it is a gift. If everybody was compensated, the budget would have to be balanced and the money so desperately needed before the election would not be there. That is another part of this outrageous situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Historically, oppositions have come to power and broken promises simply because they could claim&mdash;and do so honestly from either side of politics&mdash;that they did not know the full state of affairs; they had not seen the government's accounts. When you are in government, all the figures are there. It is totally dishonest to say, `We have had to impose all these taxes. We have had to break all these promises because we did not know the gun was loaded.' Of course the government knew the gun was loaded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, on the issue of extending the age for the eligibility of the aged pension for women, the government blatantly attacked our proposition. It clearly indicated to the people of Australia that the government did not intend doing what is being done here today. It brings the government no credit. I do not give a dash how the government's circumstances stand in the opinion polls. It does not change the fact that the people of Australia were misled on this particular issue by the government's side of politics. It is no good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the House the other day, I pointed out how frequently we have supported the government on the basis of our philosophy and how we allowed it to achieve economic reform. I pointed out how easy it might have been for us to have prevented the sale of portions of the Commonwealth Bank. It was an icon. The government knows very well how it would have dealt with the matter&mdash;it would have found its instructions in its little black book&mdash;if we had been in government and had announced an intention to sell part of the Commonwealth Bank. The government can give us a lesson in politics, if it likes. For goodness sake! It is all a matter of hypocrisy. We are supporting the government today&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to raise the matter of the advanced pharmaceutical allowance. That is a very important issue amongst the veteran community. I consider the bill's proposal to address the problem we have with the pharmaceutical allowance as a major amendment. This legislation actually allows for the re-introduction of the advanced pharmaceutical allowance which was previously cut off due to a sunset clause in the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Act (No. 2). I am really pleased that this is being addressed here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill provides for the reintroduction of that allowance starting from 1 January next year. No doubt that will be a very welcome new year present to our veteran community. All of us, as members, are in constant contact with our veteran community. Given the advanced age of many of our veterans, this initiative is a very worthy one and deserves the support of all members of this place. The advance pharmaceutical allowance was originally made available to chronically ill pensioners with a high volume of prescription drug use. When the date in the sunset clause was reached before amending legislation was dealt with by the parliament the allowance was cancelled, and that has been a concern. This bill will now not only reintroduce the advanced allowance for this category of pensioners, but also ensure that the scheme is not subject to any other sunset clauses.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise here today to speak on the Veterans Affairs' Legislation Amendment Bill  (No. 2) of 1994. This bill will bring the veterans pensions into line with the aged pension by increasing the qualifying age at which women can apply for the aged service pension from 55 to 65 years, over a 10-year period. The bill will also reintroduce the advance pharmaceutical allowance from January next year. This is a measure that is welcome. Thirdly, the bill will increase the maximum rate of the dependent child add-on by $52 a year for service pensioners with children under 16 years of age.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This change to the pension entitlements for women is a reflection of the change that was included in the Social Security Legislation Amendment Act (No. 2) of 1994. The reason for this is simple. The original distinction between the pension ages for men and women was based on the fact that, in the past, there was a much lower labour force participation rate for women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stand here today, as a particularly happy and proud woman, to say that this is one of the areas where women are definitely making inroads. The statistics bear those inroads out. It is because of that increased participation rate in the work force for women that the pension age for women will slowly be increased from the current level of 55 years to 60 years. The first increment will take place on 1 July 1995. The phasing in will be entirely equitable, and will take place over an extended period of time. This method of implementation recognises the remaining labour force disadvantages incurred over the years by the older women affected by these measures.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must stress, however, that the great bulk of female veterans will not be affected by these measures, because they are already older than 63 and in receipt of the service pension. The small number of women who would have qualified at 55, and who now, under this new system, will not, will have access to labour force programs and supporting measures like the jobsearch allowance. We are not leaving them behind at any time. Women veterans who have a permanent incapacity which prevents them from working will continue to have access to the invalid service pension at any age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already stated, these changes will be implemented over a long period of time. Every two years the pension age for women will increase by six months. Increments will occur progressively on this basis until 1 January 2014. At this time, the pensionable age will be 60 years. A woman will attain pensionable age only once. Once a woman attains the age where she can claim a pension, she is eligible for that pension from then on. This is the case even if she does not claim the pension at that particular time. The reason for this is that, under the strictest possible application of the formula for the pension, it is possible for a woman to obtain pensionable age and then lose it. This bill makes sure that once pensionable age is attained it is maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second major provision of this bill is the reintroduction of provisions for the payment of the advance pharmaceutical allowance, which will take effect from 1 January 1995. From 1 November 1990, provision was made for chronically ill pensioners who constantly used a high volume of drugs to have access to the advance pharmaceutical allowance. This was initially introduced for a period of one year, and was later extended for a further two years. These provisions were later removed. The bill we have before us today will reintroduce access to that facility. With the passage of this bill, from 1 January 1995 the advance pharmaceutical allowance will again be paid. As well as the fact that this facility will be reintroduced, it will also no longer be subject to sunset provisions. The ability to gain payment of the advance pharmaceutical allowance is back, and it is here to stay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third major provision of this bill is to increase the level of dependent child add-on for service pensioners with children who have not yet turned 16. This rate will be increased by $52 per year. This measure essentially stems from the 1993 budget process. The decision was taken at that time that, from 1 January 1995, the highest rate of additional family payment should be raised by $1 per week for every child under 16. The basis for this measure was to help low income earners and the unemployed to offset the 1993 budget increase in the wholesale tax. This bill proposes that $52 per year be added to the under-13 and the over-13 but under-16 add-on rates for dependent children, and will take effect from 1 January 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reality, this provision really brings service pensioners into line with additional family payments under the Social Security Act. The Social Security Act has already been amended to increase that additional family payment. This bill will pass those changes on to service pensioners with dependent children that come under the provisions of the Veterans' Entitlement Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is essentially a small bill, and it represents a very small part of this government's plans and program for Australian veterans. The Australian government has an overall veterans program which is the envy of many governments and many individual veterans throughout the world. Make no mistake: this government looks after its veteran community very, very well. There are some governments which have been involved in some of the same conflicts as Australia but do not even have a federal department of veterans' affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We as a nation are also very lucky to have a minister for veterans' affairs who is as dedicated and as enthusiastic as the one we have in the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca). His `Australia Remembers' program is excellent, and has generated a huge amount of interest nationally, and especially within my own electorate of Bass. In fact, the minister was very recently in my electorate to promote his veterans program. We conducted an afternoon tea at the Launceston RSL, and it was attended by some 110 members of the local veterans community. It was a fantastic function. </PARA>

The minister received a wonderful reception at the Launceston RSL, and many in the veteran community whom I know personally and have constant dealings with are already asking me when he is coming back to northern Tasmania. It cannot be too soon, as far as I am concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a very strong veteran community in northern Tasmania. This is a community which is close-knit and supportive of its own. I cannot sing too highly the praises of those veterans who devote almost all of their time to the service of their mates. One such individual I would like to mention&mdash;and the minister himself has met with this gentleman, and I am sure will reiterate what I am about to say&mdash;is a man called Bob Fitz. He is not only a man to respect and admire for his tireless service to the veteran community of northern Tasmania, but also a man whom I am pleased and proud to be able to call a very close friend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bob Fitz is constantly helping veterans, in the formal sense. He helps them with applications, and he appears as an advocate for them before panels of review; but that is not where it stops: Bob is also a counsellor to his mates. As in all veteran communities in Australia, northern Tasmania has veterans who are on the edge. For some veterans, the pressure is still too great: the memories are still too real, and the horror is still too close. The people in this place should never forget that fact, and they should never forget the sacrifice that these people have made and are still making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bob Fitz helps these veterans. He talks with them at all hours of the day or night. He visits them. He has a drink with them, and he supports them. These people turn to Bob Fitz when they will not turn to anyone else, and they do so because he is one of them. He has been through what they have been through. He has experienced what they have experienced, and he has dealt with it. There are very few professional counsellors with that sort of experience, and I will bet there are very few who are as effective. The work of people such as Bob Fitz is one way in which the veteran community of northern Tasmania is served. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A former Deputy Prime Minister, Lance Barnard, also serves the veteran community. I am in the particularly lucky position of having Lance Barnard still serving the community&mdash;especially the veteran community&mdash;through my office. For those members and others here today who do not know Lance Barnard, he held the seat of Bass for 21 years and became Deputy Prime Minister under Gough Whitlam in 1972. He was Minister for Defence from 1972 to 1975, when he retired. It is because of that position, and the fact that he is a World War II veteran and has held the position of Director of the Office of Australian War Graves, that Lance Barnard has such a great interest in the veteran community of northern Tasmania. </PARA>

He gives his time freely and he works as tirelessly now as when he was still the member for Bass. I might add that Lance Barnard turned 75 on May 1 this year. He has never retired. </PARA>

I think honourable members would find that most people, after a lengthy career in public life, would like to drop out totally or relax at home. Lance Barnard is not like that. The work Lance does now in his retirement shows that he was not like many politicians. He entered politics for the right reason. He genuinely wanted to serve the community. Even in his retirement, Lance Barnard is serving the community. I cannot pay him any greater tribute than to say, `Thank you, Lance, for that commitment.' He is someone that I genuinely aspire to be like as a politician and as a person. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is always a privilege to speak on a veterans' affairs bill. I think I have spoken on most of them since I have been in this place because, as the honourable member for Bass (Mrs Silvia Smith) has already said, veterans are very important people in our life. I think, when we talk about veterans' affairs, that we need to take an historical perspective on Australia's involvement in war.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is a small nation and, even before it became a nation, its people were sending troops to war. From the Sudan through to Vietnam we have sent our troops to wars, mostly wars that were not our own. I would make an exception with that part of the Second World War when the Japanese came into the war and our country was definitely under threat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, for the most part, we have been generous in war. We have given our troops, our services, to other nations. Of course, in the beginning we were part of what was then known as the `mother country' and we are a part of the Commonwealth. I am sure all honourable members will, if they did not see it in person, certainly have seen replayed many times the then Prime Minister, Mr Menzies, saying that, as a consequence of Britain being at war, Australia was also at war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In lots of cases we had no choice and we sent our personnel, mostly our men, to those wars. Ninety-four thousand men&mdash;mostly men&mdash;have died in those wars, starting with the Sudan, the Boxer rebellion and the Boer War. They were wars that are mostly forgotten now except for the two world wars, Korea and Vietnam. We have made an enormous sacrifice, one that is totally out of proportion to our population and to our strategic position in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also need to be aware of the profound effects that war has had, not only on those who took part in those encounters but on their families, and here I speak very much from personal experience. My father was in the navy practically all his working life so, as a child, I was used to his being away. Of course, during the war he was away virtually all the time so I never saw him very much then. I did not really get to know him until I was in my teens, and shortly after that he died. He died at the age of 58 from a heart disease but it was considered to have been due to war service. He was a TPI. So the toll on the families has been enormous and it is something we often forget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a TV program recently about women in war and it showed families where the children were scared of their fathers. I have to say that I was one of those. I was to rejoice when my father came home and all I knew was that this man in a uniform came in and within five minutes had me in tears because he was trying to run the family as he thought it ought to be run. It was not his fault, it was not my mother's fault, it was the fault of the fact that he was at war. After the war he spent a considerable time in New Guinea and northern Australia on minesweepers, so once again he was absent. I think that profound effect on the families is something we ought to remember. For that reason the measures that we have brought in for veterans and for their families are very worthwhile, and an organisation like Legacy does a tremendous job in working with those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several of the previous speakers have talked about the heroes of war, people from their own electorates. I made a speech in this place some time ago about two particular men I met last Anzac Day, Dr Jim Thorp and Mr John Robinson. They were both in their 90s and both had served in both world wars. Dr Thorp I alluded to in particular because unfortunately he died shortly after I met him on Anzac Day. He was 98 or 99 at that stage. He had gone to the First World War as a medical orderly. During the interim he trained as a doctor and he went back as a medical officer. Those people have made an enormous contribution and they are deserving of everything we can give them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Bass alluded to the kinds of things that Australia does for its veterans compared with other countries. I was very much aware as a child of men coming back from war and receiving an opportunity to study; their fees were paid if they wanted to undertake a course of study. They were given grants of land if they wanted to start a smallholding or a farm and also were given assistance with their house payments to buy a house. When my father died, my mother then took over the war service home loan, which was at a very low rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we have done and we continue to do a lot for our veterans, particularly in the area of health, and also in counselling. That is something that is fairly new. Unfortunately, there are still some people in the ADF who think that counselling is a bit wussy and something that only soft people need. The traumas of war, I think, are something we have overlooked for too long. In the First World War people were shot for deserting, for cowardice, and really they were suffering from what we now know as stress syndrome. Fortunately we have now recognised this with our Vietnam veterans, who had a doubly bad time because not only did they suffer from all those things that they saw and were engaged in but also they suffered to a great extent from rejection by a lot of people in their own community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken of this before but I am very proud that there is a post-traumatic stress syndrome program at the St John of God Hospital in Richmond in my electorate which is going extremely well. Only last week it received an award from the Private Hospitals Association of New South Wales, and I will be writing to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) about that shortly. I hope he will write a letter congratulating the hospital on that success. I was fortunate to go and talk to some of the men who were engaged in its first program and they told me about some of the trauma they were going through in that program just recalling things that had happened to them and feeling as though they wanted to run away and get out of there. However, their comrades&mdash;they did not know each other before they went in but they were soon comrades because they had been in the same engagement&mdash;helped by saying, `No, hang in. It is going to be worthwhile.' Now I am getting feedback from those people saying what a benefit it was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One particular case which I cannot resist mentioning, and I have sent a letter to the minister about this, was mentioned in a letter from one of the participants in that program who lives on the north coast of New South Wales. He wrote to the hospital and said that one of his fellow participants had come to see him recently for a cup of coffee. Not very sensational. But it was sensational because that man had driven from Sydney to the north coast and that is the first time he had been out on his own, virtually since he had left Vietnam, except to go to and from hospital. That was a big thing for him to get over that phobia, get in the car and drive and then sit down to talk with a mate. Those programs are definitely worthwhile and they are provided under our veterans' affairs programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I lived in the UK for some years from the early 1960s and it was not so long since the end of the war that people did not still talk about the situation. Their expression was, `All they gave us was a cardboard suit and our train fare home.' I think that is probably a rather extreme view of it. Of course, Britain was not in a position to be as generous as Australia was, because we had our own natural wealth on which to call; whereas Britain, of course, was devastated during the war, so her people did not do as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To come to the thrust of the bill, I need not go over it. It is a small bill, with three main issues. The one I want to talk about is the situation of women. Women played an extremely vital part in war. I am very conscious of this fact because I have in my electorate in the Blue Mountains a very strong ex-service women's group. The minister is to meet them fairly soon and he will have a long schedule there. These women are very active: they keep together and support each other. They come to me when one of their members is having trouble getting into hospital for an operation or is having any problem at all, and I am very glad to help them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government is easing it in over 20 years. Like all the other social security measures, it is being applied to veterans. As my colleague the honourable member for Bass has said, this will affect very few women who have served in past wars, because most of them are over that age now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that the age equalisation issue has been a vexed one and, as a matter of principle, as women strive for equality, this is one of the measures that we need to take. Of course, we have to acknowledge that it is going to affect some women, particularly older women and, in the case of the social security pension, the women who are now in their late 50s. For that reason, the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) has set up a working group, which I coordinate, to look at ways of implementing this measure&mdash;which comes in next July&mdash;in order to minimise its effect on such women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of those particular women is in my electorate. She is now 58. She is a very modern woman who believes in equality. She is still working. She was a person who suffered from what we would call the old regimes. She was in the Commonwealth Public Service and, at that time, women had to leave the Service when they got married. We all agree that that was a pretty antiquated law, and it does not apply now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, women who were caught up in that system are now reaching retirement age and they wish to have their pension at the time that they expected they would. After this particular woman got married, she had children and then went back into the work force. Now she is being squeezed out of her job at the age of 58, because her employer thinks it is time she moved over for someone younger. While supporting the legislation which this government has put through, and which was supported by the opposition, and also supporting its reflection in the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), as a woman, I acknowledge that it is a difficult issue and one that we have to handle very carefully. For that reason, I am glad that it is not going to have too much of an effect on the women veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we are looking in a caring way at the issue for women in civilian life. We are working to minimise the effect on the most affected group of women. The women who will have to work until they are 65 know that. They are in their 40s now. They are mostly women who are in the work force. Many of them have superannuation, so the effect on them will not be so profound. I sincerely hope that women who are now in their 40s and who have to wait until they are 60 will not have to go to war and will not have to apply for a veterans pension&mdash;simply because I hope this country never has to enter those sorts of engagements again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This veterans bill reflects issues in the social security legislation. The bill that was debated earlier was to bring in more measures to help veterans. Like my colleague the honourable member for Bass, I commend the current minister and his predecessor. They have done a fantastic job. Next year will be the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. Veterans will be very visible. I think most members will also be very visible and will be out there supporting the veterans who play such an important role in our community. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will put this on the record. The female veterans who are likely to claim service pensions will mainly come from two conflicts. The first one was Korea and Malaya. The Australian involvement in Korea and Malaya finished in 1963. A female veteran would have had to be at least 23 before being sent to the operational area, but it could be expected that she would be older. At the minimum possible age, those women would be 55 years old in 1995. Recent grants of service pension to female veterans are as follows: 1991, four; 1992, two; 1993, two; 1994, one. None of these was born any later than 6 January 1937. That is, the youngest is already 57 years of age. Any further grants are not expected to be affected by the age equalisation provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other place of conflict was Vietnam. Records of participants in that conflict have been examined very closely. The number of female veterans with qualifying service from that conflict totals only 52. Of those, 19 are either pensioners already or have passed away. One lives in New Zealand and could apply for service pension only if she returns to live in Australia. Of the remaining 32 who would be affected by the age equalisation provisions, if they wish to claim a service pension at the minimum age, the number affected and the ages they would need to attain are as follows: three at 55; six at 55.5; three at 56; nine at 56.5; eight at 57; one at 57.5; and two at 58. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I am trying to make here&mdash;and I will not comment on all the extraneous things that the opposition spokesman talked about&mdash;is that there are not a lot of people who are going to be affected in the veterans' affairs portfolio. At the end of the day, I feel quite comfortable with the provision and I do not think, as I say, that there will be too many people who will be too worried about it.

Whereas before the opposition was able to consider a minister's remarks adequately because we had prior notification, the second reading speech having been given at the time the legislation was introduced, we are now in no position to do that and that is an impediment on debate in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A consequence in the context of this legislation is that I am, with my prepared remarks, now going to repeat a great deal of what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) has just had to say, which I would not have had to do under the former arrangements. I think that tends to waste people's time. Not knowing what the parliamentary secretary was going to say in his second reading speech, I naturally set out to put my comments in the context of the legislation. Had the parliamentary secretary not done as he did, it would not have been a matter of great concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On those two grounds I must say I regret the abandonment of the old procedure because the opposition is not in a position to respond to the second reading speech. Remember that ministers, or parliamentary secretaries, as the case may be, always have the resources of government to help them get their words together and to get their thoughts in some sort of logical sequence, and that is not available to the opposition, in this case the coalition. I think it does have the effect of stifling debate as well as causing me, on this occasion anyway, to indulge in some tedious repetition which probably will be in breach of standing orders, Mr Deputy Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill, the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994, was introduced into the House on 19 September after passing through the Senate on 30 August. It sets out to amend the Superannuation Industry Supervision Act 1993, known as the SI(S) Act, and the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993, or the SRC Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The SI(S) Act effectively began operating on 1 July of this year. The principal act provides the legislative framework for the prudent management of certain superannuation funds, particularly the security of members' moneys, and for certain minimum standards. The principal act has already been amended once this year by the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments to the SI(S) Act and to the SRC Act currently before us are aimed at enhancing the operations of those acts. The coalition does not oppose this bill because the amendments represent primarily housekeeping measures. As the parliamentary secretary has already pointed out, there is no financial impact arising from these measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment bill before us is largely the result of the willingness of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, the ISC, to listen to the concerns and recommendations of the superannuation industry. The performance of the ISC can be largely measured by the degree to which the industry can work with it. Also, according to Senator Watson, who is chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, the ISC has developed a good working relationship with the select committee and with his office. The ISC should be commended on its performance to date and I sincerely hope that other agencies, such as the Australian Taxation Office, can take its example and be less confrontational. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One matter that relates to the operation of the ISC and the need for amendment bills is that under part 29 of the SI(S) Act the ISC has the power to modify provisions of the act, either temporarily or permanently. Modifications of a permanent nature are of concern. They effectively have the potential to change the intention of the act. Of course, modification orders are gazetted, but they are not subject to the scrutiny that amendment bills or regulations would receive in the normal course of events. Parliament, by allowing modifications, is delegating its legislative role to a government agency in circumstances where there is no form of legislated requirement for review. To the best of my knowledge, to date the ISC has used its power to modify the SI(S) Act in a responsible manner, so I am anticipating a concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this is an issue to which members of the House should give consideration. Should we be prepared to delegate our legislative role in this way or should we take a more active position in protecting the legislative workings of the parliament? That is the question I want honourable members to consider. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be preferable for permanent modifications to the SI(S) Act to be achieved by legislative change, with the ISC modifications being used only as a temporary measure. A majority of the amendments made by this bill affect the SI(S) Act. The bill, as it was originally introduced into the Senate, has already been amended. Many of the amendments are of a minor and technical nature. Where I mention in the course of my remarks the relevant division of the bill, it should be assumed that I am referring to those divisions in part 2 that are amendments to the SI(S) Act, unless I indicate otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Division 3 allows certain non-bank financial institutions to offer what are known as approved guarantees. This measure relates to the standard of investments. The bill amends the SI(S) Act to allow certain non-bank financial institutions to offer guarantees required under the SI(S) Act. Currently, only approved banks, and the Commonwealth, states or territories, can offer guarantees required under the SI(S) Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also amends the SI(S) Act to enable building societies, credit unions and similar organisations, which are subject to supervision under the various state financial institutions codes, to also be able to offer such guarantees. As well, division 3 allows `in-house' investments in certain non-bank financial institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An `in-house asset' is essentially a loan to, or an investment in, a standard employer sponsor of the fund, or an associate of such an employer sponsor, and the SI(S) Act places restrictions, for prudential reasons, on the level of such investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill amends the SI(S) Act to treat deposits in certain non-bank financial institutions, which are subject to prudential supervision, in the same manner as deposits in an approved bank, with the objective of determining whether they are in-house assets. The effect of this amendment is significant, as the SI(S) Act restricts the in-house assets of regulated superannuation funds to 10 per cent of the total assets in most cases. What it does is rope in the non-bank institutions, such as building societies and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Division 7 of the bill amends the SI(S) Act to ensure that a trustee cannot accept a person as a member of a public offer entity, unless that person has applied in the appropriate manner and has received relevant information, of a calibre determined by the commissioner, about the entity beforehand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Division 11 amends section 66 of the SI(S) Act.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill amends the SI(S) Act to ensure that an excluded superannuation fund can only acquire business real property from a member, or relative of a member, if the property is business real property in the member's or relative's principal business. </PARA>

Division 12 of the bill amends the SI(S) Act to allow such funds the option of either having an independent trustee, or having equal numbers of employer and member representatives, involved in the trusteeship of the fund. This provides funds with greater flexibility in organising their trusteeship, while at the same time ensuring that members are protected in the first instance by having a trustee who is independent, and, in the second, by having direct involvement in the fund via equal representation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employee representatives need not necessarily be members of the superannuation fund. They are usually representatives nominated by the members of a fund, a trade union or other organisation representing the interests of those members. There is much merit in having employee trustees. Even where the option of an independent trustee is taken up, it would be useful if funds were required to have at least one representative from the fund membership who is, in the vernacular, from the shop floor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a fund member representative would benefit the prudential protection of the fund and reassure workers that the fund is sound. It is a matter I believe the ISC should give serious consideration to. It is also a matter that Senator Watson has been pursuing for some time with no response from the government so far. Overall, this amendment to sections 91 to 93 of the SI(S) Act will undoubtedly provide funds with much greater flexibility in organising their trusteeship. It will also ensure that members are protected by having a trustee who is independent and by having direct involvement in the fund by means of equal representation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Division 13 allows for existing trustees to give a notice of retirement without a need to call a meeting of beneficiaries. A fundamental principle of the SI(S) Act is that superannuation entities should be in control of a single party&mdash;the trustees who take full responsibility for the fund. However, corporations law currently requires that superannuation entities which are public offer entities have dually responsible parties comprising the trustees and the management company. The SI(S) Act enables these public offer entities to change to a single party in control of the fund. In many cases this will involve the trustee retiring and the management company taking over the role of trustee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effective and smooth operation of this changeover may be hampered if the existing trustee is required to hold a meeting of beneficiaries before retiring, as the governing rules of some superannuation entities may in fact require. To overcome that problem and therefore to ensure a smoother changeover, the bill amends the SI(S) Act to provide that such a requirement in the governing rules of the fund will have no effect. This is a commonsense measure. It will eliminate the unnecessary expense to superannuation funds where an existing trustee retires as a result of provisions in the SI(S) Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Division 14 of the bill amends the SI(S) Act to allow the minister to approve disclosure of otherwise protected information, if it is in the public interest to do so, to the public at large rather than to particular members of the public. How the public interest is defined is always interesting. I have no doubt it will be the same in this case. Naturally enough, the public interest as perceived by the minister could be very different from that of an impartial observer. Where such disclosure does occur, I hope it is only undertaken on the advice of the ISC. It is essential that political chicanery not be correlated with the public interest. At the same time, the bill amends the SI(S) Act to ensure that appropriate protection is provided to an individual by only allowing disclosure of information that relates to the private affairs of an individual where such disclosure would not be unreasonable in the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ISC is currently able to disclose information to the Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Securities Commission. These amendments will allow the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal to receive information obtained by the ISC. The effective operation of the tribunal which also commenced on 1 July 1994 can only be improved by these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Keeping in mind the Privacy Act and the need to ensure individual privacy, where the ISC does hand information over to the tribunal this should only occur where the person concerned has given the ISC written authorisation. The disclosure of information to the tribunal should only be done where authority to do so has been given because it protects the privacy of the person concerned and it protects the ISC against any possible future dispute as to whether it was reasonable to disclose the information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Division 15 of the bill amends the SI(S) Act to ensure consistency between related provisions in the act which deal with the purposes for which an approved deposit fund may be maintained, and payments to beneficiaries also. This clarifies the existing obligation. The SI(S) Act currently restricts disqualified persons from being trustees or investment managers of superannuation entities. There is, however, no similar requirement on custodians. Division 17 of the bill amends the SI(S) Act to address this problem and ensure that custodians are subject to similar eligibility requirements to those applying to trustees and to investment managers. Naturally, custodians play an important role in safeguarding the assets of their clients in their contractual relationships with a trustee or an investment manager. It is more important that these sorts of prudential controls extend to custodians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Division 18 deals with the removal of trustees of public offer entities in section 60A. The bill inserts a new requirement into this SI(S) Act to prevent another party from trying to exert undue influence on a trustee by threatening to remove the trustee unless the trustee complies with that party's requests. This should serve to reinforce the perceived and intended real independence of trustees by requiring that the government rules of public offer funds allow a trustee to be removed only by the commissioner, unless the removal is of a kind to be specified in later regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Division 18A requires the trustees of an exempt public sector superannuation scheme that is subject to the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act to set up arrangements for dealing with inquiries or complaints. Clauses 50 to 52 enable regulations to be made bringing currently exempt public sector superannuation schemes within the operation of the S(RC) Act. This also is a welcome measure. It will increase the accessibility of the tribunal by public sector fund members and ensure that those funds that elect to become subject to the SI(S) Act have an internal resolution mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This latest amendment rectifies an earlier problem. Previously, if a fund did not have an internal resolution mechanism a member could not go to the tribunal. Clauses 50 to 52 allow state and territory governments to legislate to subject their public superannuation schemes to the operations of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. Ultimately, the decision to do so rests with the states, although to date I believe only Victoria and New South Wales have opted to stay out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, superannuation policy under Labor has been a litany of wasted opportunities. The very rapidity of legislative changes to superannuation policy has created uncertainty where stability should exist. Superannuation is not as widely accepted as it should be as the preferred vehicle for retirement saving. Management fees, taxes levied on moneys going into and out of funds, the legislative uncertainty and the lack of choice of superannuation schemes have led to many people challenging the worth of superannuation as it is now constituted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The superannuation guarantee charge, the SGC, continues to be a major concern for employers. Imposing the costs of the SGC predominantly on employers is an impost that cannot be afforded. For every employer, the SGC is another hefty payroll tax that discourages investment in Australia and impacts negatively on possible future job creation. If the SGC exists to fund the retirement of an employer's employees, why should the employer foot the retirement bill? It is a social matter. Employees should also bear responsibility for their own superannuation contributions. Only by contributing towards the cost of their own retirement will employees realise the cost involved and gain an appreciation of the ownership of their future retirement income. Of course, there is the additional impost of complying with the SGC. This is just another cost that is added to the already long list of costs incurred over and above the total wages bill. Superannuation provides one method by which Australians can maximise our national savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is in total disarray when it comes to a savings policy. The FitzGerald report on national savings advocated several necessary changes to government policy on superannuation that would assist in increasing the rate of savings. FitzGerald recommended, amongst other things, superannuation savings accounts and increased competition between the current players and, of course, future players. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the last election, the coalition advocated the establishment of retirement savings accounts. These accounts would have enjoyed the same superannuation tax concessions that we were advocating for superannuation policies. Our objective in advocating retirement savings accounts was twofold: to expand the range of choice available to individuals and to allow banks and other financial institutions to compete with superannuation funds in the provision of superannuation schemes. These savings accounts would also have been available to low income and seasonal workers, thereby maintaining the tax office as the collector of government revenue, not as the manager of superannuation accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Greater competition in the provision of superannuation is anathema to Labor and the reasons are crystal clear: Labor is looking after its mates. Rather than introducing greater competition to the provision of superannuation, the government has closed the door on greater competition in order to protect existing super funds and, particularly, the role of the ACTU in occupational superannuation. The ACTU has been a constant opponent of greater competition and seems, once again, to have exercised its veto. To date, the ACTU has won all the battles, leaving the community as the loser. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the ACTU and this government, it seems superannuation has little to do with retirement income policy, and more to do with industrial relations and taxation. The drive for award based superannuation has taken little, if any, account of productivity. It takes no account of a firm's capacity to pay, and it denies individuals the right to best decide where their superannuation contributions should go. Nearly all award based superannuation contributions are paid into union dominated superannuation funds. The award based superannuation system is made worse because of the number of awards that cover many occupational groupings. These numerous superannuation schemes all have different conditions and obligations which must be met by employers. This makes the cost of complying with the superannuation guarantee all that much higher. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to Labor coming to power in March 1983, there were no taxes on contributions and fund earnings, and tax was only payable on five per cent of an individual's lump sum entitlement at the individual's marginal rate. There are now six taxes on superannuation that tax employer contributions, super fund investment income, the lump sums of those individuals under 55 years, ad infinitum. Superannuation has become Labor's milch cow. Labor's approach is simple: if it moves, tax it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This approach to retirement incomes has discouraged and confused many people about the benefits of superannuation. For individuals to fully fund their retirement, they need more than just the superannuation guarantee. They also need the desire to make their own contributions. By discouraging individual superannuation contributions, the government is actively discouraging the community from saving for retirement. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 17 August this year, Barrie Dunstan wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Governments, as well as consumers, may need educating, considering that research group Mintel has found that, relative to many European countries, the level of targeted retirement income here is low. Taking the Australian level of retirement income from government pensions and privately financed savings as the base of 100, Mintel's figures put the relative welfare index of Italy at 196, Spain at 186, Sweden at 162 and Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg at 147.</PARA>
<PARA>It is obvious that the governments of those countries are encouraging a much higher rate of retirement income for their citizens. Of course, this will also have the potential of translating into higher rates of national savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will announce a revised superannuation policy, in the lead-up to the next election, that will try to come to grips with many of these issues. It will not necessarily mirror that of the 1993 election, but it will be committed to increasing the flexibility of the superannuation system and reducing the compliance costs of businesses.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industry, Science and Technology has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) In 1993-4, CSIRO provided funding of $326,000 to the Murray-Darling Freshwater Research Centre's core budget and intends to maintain this level of funding throughout the triennium from 1994-5 to 1996-7.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The majority of funds for the Centre come from non-Commonwealth Government sources. While the CSIRO intends to maintain its funding support, the ability of the Murray-Darling Freshwater Research Centre to continue its research at the current level will depend on the Centre's success in attracting research grants and continued funding from the Centre's other partners.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Yes. The Assistant Treasurer, under Part 2 of the Industry Commission Act 1989, referred Australia's approach to occupational health and safety to the Industry Commission for inquiry and report within twelve months of receiving the reference, dated 23 May 1994. The Assistant Treasurer has since extended the reporting date by two months to 23 June 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) No. It is usual practice for Australia not to ratify an ILO Convention until all relevant jurisdictions (Commonwealth, State and Territory) have established compliance with the provisions of the Convention, and all relevant governments have formally agreed to ratification. Furthermore, consultations with the peak employer and worker organisations (the ACCI and the ACTU) are carried out before ratification is undertaken.</PARA>
