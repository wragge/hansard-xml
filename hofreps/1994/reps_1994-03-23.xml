<PARA>The Insurance Laws Amendment Bill amends three acts. Firstly, the bill amends the Insurance Act 1973. This act provides the basis for the Insurance and Superannuation Commission's financial and prudential supervision of general insurance companies conducting business in Australia. The opportunity is being taken to make minor amendments to this act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments will remove anomalies involving the valuation of shares in related insurance companies and investments in related unit trusts. They also provide for more commercial and administrative flexibility in directions made by the commissioner where there is doubt as to the viability of an insurer, and make minor amendments to provisions dealing with the principal banker of an insurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the bill also amends the Insurance Laws Amendment Act 1991 to make clear that phasing-in provisions dealing with the capital and solvency requirements of registered life offices apply only to those life offices registered under the Life Insurance Act 1945 at the date of the original amendment. Thirdly, the bill will give effect to measures that substantially increase the effectiveness of the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This act protects the insuring public against the negligence or misconduct of an insurance agent or broker and encourages practices consistent with the interests of the insuring public, including standards of conduct and quality of advice. It makes insurers responsible for the actions of their agents and provides a system of registration of insurance brokers and those agents acting on behalf of unauthorised foreign insurers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments will enable the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to more effectively discharge his responsibilities and will provide greater protection to purchasers of insurance through intermediaries. The amendments were developed following a comprehensive review of the operations of the act by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, in consultation with industry, consumers and other interested parties.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are based on this review and do not include consideration of matters arising from subsequent inquiries such as the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and Trade Practices Commission reviews of life insurance. These will be subject to further legislative proposals later this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill was introduced into the Senate in December last year to allow broader public scrutiny of the measures it contained. As a result of this process the government moved one amendment involving a minor policy issue and this has been agreed by the Senate and incorporated into the bill now before the House. I will now provide a brief outline of the key amendments to be made to the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984. </PARA>
<PARA>.The proposed amendments introduce a maximum 37-day period in which agents may hold premium moneys. This replaces a requirement that such moneys be passed to insurers as soon as it is reasonably practicable to do so, which has not worked effectively in practice. </PARA>
<PARA>.The effect of this amendment is to set a maximum time that agents may hold premium moneys, while allowing normal commercial&mdash;monthly settlement&mdash;arrangements to operate. Special exemption arrangements will apply to underwriting agents who, because of the nature of their business, are not reasonably able to comply with these settlement arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>.The proposed amendments clarify the liability of insurers for the actions of their agents by making clear that insurers have joint and several liability for agents who deal with more than one insurer. This will ensure that consumers are protected in the case where a multi-agent acts beyond the authority granted by his or her principals. </PARA>
<PARA>.Multi-agents will be required to declare to all insurers with whom they have agency agreements the existence of any agency agreements they have with other insurers. </PARA>
<PARA>.The proposed amendments ensure that the clients of brokers and unauthorised foreign insurers are better protected by requiring a no avoidance of claims clause as well as run-off cover in their compulsory professional indemnity insurance contracts. Any cancellation of such contracts will be required to be notified to the commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA>.The proposed amendments provide for the commissioner to determine the type and form of audited accounts to be furnished by registered intermediaries. They also increase the power of the commissioner to inspect documents and obtain information about the activities of intermediaries, whether for purposes of routine supervision or for prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA>.Subject to appropriate safeguards, they provide the commissioner with the scope to refuse, suspend or cancel the registration of an intermediary who becomes insolvent or bankrupt, provides unsatisfactory accounts or otherwise fails to satisfy the ordinary obligations of an insurance intermediary. </PARA>
<PARA>.The proposed amendments extend from one to three years the time allowed to the commissioner to prosecute offences under the act. This is necessary because of the particular nature of many of the fiduciary offences under the act which, by their nature, take time to come to the commissioner's notice. </PARA>
<PARA>.The opportunity is also being taken to update the penalty provisions in the act and to introduce more meaningful penalties for serious offences such as failure to properly deal with premium moneys. </PARA>
<PARA>.Finally, the proposed amendments lower the threshold at which there is considered to be an association between an insurer and a broker from a test of 50 per cent ownership or control to one of 25 per cent ownership or control. They also make a number of other minor technical changes to the legislation to improve its operational effectiveness. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) has pointed out, we are dealing with the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill 1993 and will later be discussing the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993. These bills represent a major overhaul of the arrangements for the financial and prudential supervision of insurance companies in Australia. The legislation follows widespread dissatisfaction with some aspects of the insurance industry over many years. That dissatisfaction has been expressed by consumers and within the business community. The industry has developed a bad reputation for commission-driven sales that show scant regard for the real needs of consumers. The industry has also come to be seen as being secretive and thereby lacking accountability. There is currently little transparency in the activities of insurance companies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The level of information disclosure and financial reporting required of insurance companies is well below that required of other entities affected by and operating under Corporations Law. The industry has seen some spectacular corporate failures, such as the aborted sale of the Regal and Occidental Life companies. Many of the problems that have been seen in arriving at this legislation have been attributed to inadequacies in the existing legislative framework and the lack of powers for the industry regulator, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, the ISC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Life Insurance Act 1945 is the source of many of these inadequacies. Many of the insurance products sold today simply did not exist when the Life Insurance Act was first conceived. For example, deferred annuities, one of the most common rollover products, are not differentiated under the act from any other annuity products. The regular reports required by the ISC under the act are therefore unable to determine the extent of deferred annuities as against other annuity products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Financial reporting to the ISC under the act concentrates for the moment only on the solvency of a relevant company. There is no focus on company profitability, which means that it is impossible to put a value on a life company or to make comparisons between one company and another. Also, there is widespread uncertainty about accounting practices used by insurance companies. There is considerable debate, for example, about how property investments are valued and the status of loans made to agents, known as agency development loans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All income received by an insurance company is reported as revenue, regardless of its origins. So deposits by investments into savings plans are shown as income whereas a similar deposit at a bank would be shown as a liability. There is no legally required accounting standard covering the accounts of life insurance companies. While there exists a number of ISC circulars on the subject which seek to guide industry practice, they are not binding. A general accounting standard was introduced for the general insurance industry which has required a drastic overhaul of company reporting systems, but this standard has already come in for a lot of criticism from the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also no specific solvency standards at present. The ISC requires minimum reserves to protect investment portfolios from losses, but companies can easily conceal their true financial strength by showing a single amount for policy liabilities determined on just about any base by the companies' actuaries. In 1990, Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu undertook a comparison of the methods used to value shareholders' investments in 16 shareholder owned life companies and the methods used for the inclusion of those life companies' profits in the holding companies' accounts. It came up with 16 uniquely different combinations of financial reporting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been a number of attempts to come to grips with the many problems with the existing supervisory and prudential framework for the insurance industry. The House may recall that in 1991 the parliament passed several bills affecting the insurance industry, particularly those relating to acquisitions and takeovers. That legislation was an attempt to avoid any recurrence of the Regal and Occidental Life debacle, although it obviously amounted to closing the stable door long after the horse had bolted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the 1991 legislation, the ISC must be notified of a change in ownership of more than 15 per cent of an Australian insurance company. The legislation also puts in place a `fit and proper persons' test for the directors and managers of such companies. The ISC was given greater powers to undertake investigations and to obtain financial statements more promptly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This latest bill represents an attempt to redress the full range of problems with the existing insurance legislation. As the parliamentary secretary has pointed out, the bill before us was announced by both the then Treasurer and the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh) on 14 July last year and was introduced into the Senate on 16 December 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted, however, that the then proposed changes to the existing insurance legislation announced in July last year are more extensive than the measures contained in this bill and in the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993. Both bills now under consideration are chiefly concerned with the consumer protection aspects of the changes that were announced last July and of the relevant changes to the ISC's powers. We are still waiting on legislated changes to give effect to the government's proposals for prudential supervision of the insurance industry more generally, although we have been advised of the broad outline of those proposals. To that end, further proposed legislation is to be introduced later this year, hopefully in a form that is complementary to and consistent with amendments we are considering today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill seeks to amend three acts: the Insurance Act 1973, the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984 and the Insurance Laws Amendment Act 1991. The proposed amendments to the Insurance Act 1973, though minor, remove anomalies involving the valuation of shares in related insurance companies and investments in related unit trusts. The ISC will be able to issue directions about the disposal and treatment of certain assets, or classes of assets, where there is doubt as to the solvency of the insurer. There is also a provision to update that part of the act that deals with an insurer's principal banker. However, the vast bulk of the bill is concerned with amendments to the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Insurance brokers sell both general and life insurance and are required to be registered under the 1984 act. The act aims to protect consumers and requires brokers to act for the policyholder, have indemnity insurance, and comply with rules for the handling of insurance premiums and claims. As we all know, brokers play an important role in the insurance industry. In 1992-93 they dealt with almost half the total premiums paid in that year. There were 1,034 registered brokers at the end of 1992-93 handling premiums of $3.9 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original act sought to protect consumers from negligence or misconduct by an insurance agent or broker. It sought to encourage standards of conduct and quality of advice consistent with the interests of insurance consumers. The amendments contained in this bill will provide further protection for consumers and allow the ISC to more effectively discharge its responsibilities under the act. The bill also stipulates a period of a maximum of 37 days during which agents may hold premium moneys. This amendment supersedes the existing requirement that agents pass on moneys to insurers as soon as practicable, something which has not always happened in practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Special arrangements are to be made to exempt underwriting agents who cannot comply with these settlement arrangements because of the nature of their particular businesses. The proposed amendments also clarify the liability of insurers for the actions of their agents. These measures aim to protect consumers against negligence or misconduct by an insurance agent or broker. The amendments to the act enable the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to more effectively provide greater protection to individuals who purchase insurance through intermediaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professional indemnity insurance held by registered intermediaries will be strengthened. The commissioner will have to be notified in writing before such contracts are cancelled and insurers will have to honour such contracts even where non-disclosure or misrepresentation has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Insurers have joint and several responsibility for agents who deal with more than one insurer. Consumers will thus be protected where agents for more than one insurer act beyond the authority granted by the principal insurers. Multi-agents with agency agreements must declare the existence of those agreements to any other insurers with which they also have such agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for the ISC to determine the type and form of audited accounts that must be provided by registered intermediaries. The ISC is given greater powers to inspect documents and obtain information about the activities of intermediaries, either for the purposes of routine supervision or for prosecution. This includes the power to require the production of documents and conduct inspections of the premises of registered intermediaries. Where an intermediary refuses to comply with a request, the matter can be referred to a magistrate and an application may be made for a warrant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ISC is given the powers to refuse, suspend or cancel the registration of an intermediary on becoming insolvent or bankrupt, for providing unsatisfactory accounts or otherwise failing to satisfy its obligations as a registered insurance intermediary. The time allowed for the ISC to prosecute offences under the act is extended from one to three years. This will allow more time for the ISC to become aware of fiduciary offences under the act. The penalty provisions of the act are also strengthened to provide for more severe penalties for a range of offences. The bill also lowers the threshold at which there is considered to be an association between an insurer and a broker from a test of 50 per cent ownership or control to one of 25 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also seeks to amend the Insurance Laws Amendment Act 1991 by making it clear that the phasing in of capital and solvency requirements for registered life officers applies only to life officers already registered at the date of the original amendment under the Life Insurance Act 1945. As far as I can make out, this is only a clarification provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been told that it is not expected that any budgetary impact will result from the bill. However, the provisions dealing with the strengthening of cover in professional indemnity contracts will increase the cost of this cover for brokers and foreign insurance agents. The government assures us that this extra cost will be offset by benefits of increased protection for the insuring public. What the government has failed to mention so far is that this increased protection and increased regulation come at a cost to the industry which will ultimately be passed on to the consumer. In the end, it is always the consumer that pays for extra regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two elements of this legislation that I want to discuss in some depth&mdash;proposed section 9B and the increased powers of the ISC. The coalition is in favour of measures to increase consumer protection, especially when dealing with agents and brokers, but we do have some serious concerns about several provisions which are shared by the Insurance Council of Australia and the industry at large. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among the offending clauses are proposed sections 9B(3) and 9B(4). They are the run-off and the so-called non-avoidance clauses. Proposed section 9B(4) originally provided that acceptable contracts of professional indemnity insurance for foreign insurance agents and registered insurance brokers must contain a run-off clause made within three years. As a result of recent negotiations, the government has agreed to amend this three-year period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill now before us makes a minor amendment, but in no way addresses the industry's major concern about the provision apart from saying that it will specify the extent of the run-off period in the regulations. This will transfer out of the bill the contentious clause relating to a three-year period of run-off and places it in the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ISC maintains that the run-off period will be less than three years, and the figure it decides upon will be formulated after further consultation with the industry. The coalition believes the run-off period should not be a matter for regulation but should be spelled out clearly in the bill. Proposed section 9B(3) states that, even where a person has failed to comply with the duty of disclosure or made a misrepresentation on entering into a contract for professional indemnity insurance, the insurer cannot avoid the contract or reduce its liability even where the misrepresentation was fraudulent. In effect, the professional indemnity insurer will have no comeback for non-disclosure or misrepresentation, whether innocent or fraudulent. The potential impact of this clause has grave implications on the nature of future insurance contracts and premiums. It appears that the government has given no thought to these implications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government amendment will only encourage insureds not to disclose actual or potential claims when taking out professional indemnity insurance. An insured person should be legally bound to disclose all potential and actual claims prior to taking out insurance. This would inevitably lead to a higher premium, but it is normal practice which, if not observed, is actionable at common law. However, where full disclosure does not occur and a claim is made, all ultimate  consumers of relevant insurance will have to foot the bill for the payout in the form of higher premiums to recover the cost to insurers of higher indemnity insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only other legislative non-avoidance provision in Australia operates in relation to professional indemnity insurance for solicitors in New South Wales. In the New South Wales scheme, the premiums have simply skyrocketed. If the government wants non-avoidance provisions for the consumers of professional indemnity insurance, it will be the consumers of the product who will bear the increased cost through increased premiums. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Insurance Council of Australia and the National Insurance Brokers Association of Australia believe that a three-year run-off period, in conjunction with non-avoidance provisions, could increase premiums by a minimum of 65 per cent. That would be on top of an increase of 30 to 100 per cent that has occurred in the past 12 months, some of that increase being in anticipation of these and future amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An increase in premiums of at least 65 per cent on top of recent increases in premiums will threaten the viability of many brokers. Many brokers that remain in the industry may be forced to reduce their insurance cover in order to maintain some cover and still be economically viable. The inclusion of the non-avoidance provisions in this legislation brings the extra problem of a threat to erode the level of competition amongst the providers of professional indemnity insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to NIBA, only two insurers will continue to write policies if non-avoidance becomes law. As can easily be seen, this will reduce the operation of free and open competition and will certainly bring about pressures to  further increase premiums. The National Insurance Brokers Association pointed out in its submission to the government that presently the NIBA facility requires underwriters to provide terms for all risks proposed. Underwriters have indicated that, with the broad scope of cover, they would require the opportunity to be more selective in their risks, which could result in brokers not being able to purchase that cover. That would present consumers with a difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Underwriters have indicated that they will need to review audit certificates to ensure the solvency of brokers proposing to insure and estimate that 20 per cent of the risks will not find insurance. This process means that the underwriters, in a sense, become the regulators of the industry. I assume and hope that this is not the intention of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Insurance Brokers Association again highlighted that the combination of these two provisions&mdash;that is, run-off and non-avoidance&mdash;means that an unscrupulous agent may well buy, effectively, one year's cover and a three-year run-off at a premium which does not reflect the risk. For that reason, it is necessary to have a minimum run-off period perhaps of one year. That could reduce the cost of potential payouts and keep premiums in check as well as minimise the potential for any scurrilous behaviour by consumers of professional indemnity insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposed legislation also has the aim of increasing the powers of the ISC Commissioner and improving the focus of the ISC on the provisions of the various insurance acts. The ISC certainly has a huge task in overseeing the operation of insurance legislation together with superannuation legislation. The coalition hopes that there are sufficient resources, both monetary and human, for the ISC to be able to undertake this task effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In clause 28, the commissioner's new powers over the behaviour of insurance intermediaries are aimed to overcome the problems experienced in investigating alleged breaches of the act and, naturally, to increase consumer protection when dealing with intermediaries. Proposed section 41A aims to give the commissioner powers to make decision making principles in relation to registrations, suspensions and cancellations of registrations and the provision of information by intermediaries. This is a practical step that will assist reviews of the commissioner's decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 27 deals with the situation where the contract has not been accepted. A broker must, within 37 days, give notice to the insured advising that the risk has not been accepted, and return the money. Whilst the 37-day period obviously alleviates administrative inconvenience for brokers, in our view it is important for a consumer to be advised immediately&mdash;not over a month later&mdash;that the cover is not placed. If consumers are not advised immediately, they will unwittingly be caught without the appropriate cover. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clauses 29 and 30 clarify that premiums paid to subagents are taken to have been paid directly to the agent, and that premiums received by an agent must be passed to the insurer within 37 days, unless exempted. The legislation currently requires that the moneys be paid to the insurers as soon as is reasonably practicable. Insurers are bound by their agent's act and actions, and the remittance of money is a matter between the agent and the insurer. So it is that the amendment does not benefit consumers at all; therefore, why has it been made? Insurers would prefer that no amendment be made or that the time period commence from the date of inception of the contract and not as stated in the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase in the time frame for prosecution for breaches of the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act from one to three years is something that the coalition fully supports. Often it requires more than one year for a breach of the act to become apparent. Some breaches are not made known to the ISC until one year after their occurrence and those that are known of in the first year are often difficult to prosecute due to the limited time available to prepare a case. This amendment will hopefully allay fears in the community and the insurance industry that shady operators are avoiding prosecution because of the statutory prosecution time frame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current amending bill is the result of a review of the operation of the acts by the ISC, in consultation with consumers and the industry. The bill does not include matters arising from other inquiries, including the reviews of life insurance carried out by the ISC and the Trade Practices Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a bit of a worry that further amendment bills will not be debated in this place until later in the year. It is past the time for the government to get it all together and to introduce all its insurance laws amendments in one bill, or at least at the one time. The current ad hoc situation is not a good method of developing good laws for insurance or in any other area, for that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can only hope that future bills relating to prudential supervision of the insurance industry will be presented in a form that is complementary to the provisions in this bill. The coalition will not oppose this bill. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions in this bill help the consumer. The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) has obviously studied the legislation in full. He ought to be aware that there has been good consultation with the industry, with consumers and with other interested parties. This legislation will protect the public from negligence and misconduct of insurance agents or brokers. This is worthwhile legislation for the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are minor amendments to the bill. For instance, anomalies concerning the valuation of shares for insurance companies and investments in related unit trusts are attended to. Up until now, if the commissioner has had a doubt concerning the viability of an insurer, the commissioner has lacked flexibility in the directions for commercial or administrative arrangements that the commissioner can give. The provisions which deal with the principal banker are also attended to through minor amendments. The bill also amends the Insurance Laws Amendment Act to make clear that phasing-in provisions dealing with the capital and solvency requirements of registered life offices apply only to those life offices registered under the Life Insurance Act 1945 at the date of the original amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill increases the effectiveness of the Insurance  (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984. But I repeat: it protects the public from the negligence or misconduct of an insurance agent or broker and it encourages practices consistent with the interests of the insuring public, including standards of conduct and quality of advice. The bill gives us a system of registration of insurance brokers and those agents acting on behalf of unauthorised foreign insurers. It also makes the insurers responsible for the actions of their agents. It provides greater protection to purchasers of insurance through intermediaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation now is that moneys held by insurance agents are passed to insurers as soon as reasonably practicable. That has not worked very effectively in practice. The proposed amendments introduce a maximum 37-day period in which agents may hold premium moneys. The maximum time, being a monthly settlement, allows normal commercial arrangements to operate. The maximum time that the agents may hold premium moneys is also convenient for the consumer. There will be special exemptions for underwriting agents who are not reasonably able to comply. Consumers are protected when the multi-agent&mdash;who is an agent dealing with more than one insurer&mdash;acts beyond the authority granted by his or her principals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments clarify the liability of insurers for the actions of their agents. Multi-agents will be required to declare all insurers with whom they have agency agreements and the existence of any agency agreements they have with other insurers. The no avoidance of claims clause and the three-year run-off cover in the compulsory professional indemnity insurance contracts ensure that clients of brokers and unauthorised foreign insurers are better protected.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments extend the time allowed to the commissioner to prosecute offences from one to three years. The particular nature of many of the fiduciary offences makes this necessary under the act as they, by their nature, can take time to come to the commissioner's notice. The penalty provisions in the act are updated and made more meaningful for serious offences, such as failure to properly deal with premium moneys. Finally, the proposed amendments lower the threshold at which there is considered to be an association between an insurer and a broker from a test of 50 per cent ownership or control to one of 25 per cent ownership or control. They also make a number of other minor technical changes to the legislation to improve its operational effectiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by reiterating what I said at the beginning: it is quite untrue to say that the consumer does not benefit from this legislation. However, there are problems. Honourable members may not have had many problems&mdash;I have had only two or three major problems with insurers in my 11 years of service in this House. Nevertheless, if every member had two major problems through negligence or misconduct by insurers in 11 years, that would justify the legislation that has been introduced into this House today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to speak on the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill. I draw the attention of the House to a 1991 article by Anthony Boyd in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, entitled `Life industry reform slow and tortuous'. Anthony Boyd was absolutely right. In 1991, he predicted it might take two years for reforms brought on by the Occidental-Regal problem to see fruition in this parliament. It has taken a little longer than that; it has taken the establishment of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, a whole lot of bureaucracy and, in my view, some needless legislation to come to grips with some of the matters exposed in the Occidental-Regal scam.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that most interesting article, Anthony Boyd puts the proposition that, despite the flurry of activity which occurred in the sake of the $65 million Occidental-Regal scam, a new act and new arrangements with respect to superannuation could be two years away. We move slowly to solve problems such as that. The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That sort of timetable would fit in with the experience of Canada, which is in the final process of reforming its life insurance industry's supervision, financial reporting and solvency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is worth remembering that the sorts of policies not defined in the Act and now comprising the bulk of industry sales such as investment linked and investment account policies have been around for more than a decade.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is a very interesting article. It is salutary that we refer to that now&mdash;three years later&mdash;and as well note the comments of the then Treasurer, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating).<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The head of the actuarial committee advising the ISC, Mr Peter Vinson, said the principles that would go into the legislation were quite predictable. Again, this is from the same period. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Glading said any amended legislation would have to be based on three core strands:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*Standards of solvency or capital adequacy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*Meaningful presentation of regular financial statements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*Proper disclosure of all relevant information to policy-holders.</PARA>
<PARA>We are moving a bit beyond that today. In this current legislation we are also looking at proper reporting standards and the duties of brokers. The article goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most significant advance in terms of financial reporting would be the adequate disclosure of valuation methods for assets and liabilities&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>it is very interesting after the property boom to be reading this&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">assumptions adopted in the actuarial bases for the valuations and of the considerations involved in the distribution of surplus.</PARA>
<PARA>The property boom is over. Everything has gone. All of that poor behaviour by Australian corporations is now washed out of the system and we say that it did not happen. But now we are going to introduce legislation to cover situations that were identified way before 1991. This is so often the case with our government system. We have a raft of bureaucratic controls that are only moderately necessary now that times have changed. We moved past them during the period in which the needs were first identified. The government failed to act quickly. I do not think the industry identified the problems as quickly as it could have, nor was it as forthcoming as it could have been. I do not know whether the measures that we are taking are completely appropriate either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we first dealt with the brokers legislation, the 30-day proposal was put forward by the appropriate life commissioner or general commissioner for insurance from the federal bureaucracy as being necessary. The industry said that it did not need that sort of deadline, that it could have a code of conduct that it could live within and that the 30-day rule was not necessary. We are now seeing the 30-day rule becoming law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not been able to determine how many instances there have been of abuse by brokers during that period, what happened to those brokers and what powers were already possessed by the ISC or the appropriate commissioner to take action against them anyway. I think we use a great mallet to crack a nut in so many instances. When announcing the increased funding requirements necessary to resolve the problems experienced by companies such as Occidental-Regal, the then Treasurer advised that companies would be required to submit to proper tests. Anthony Boyd's article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer, Mr Keating, has announced increased capital requirements for life company owners ($2 million to $10 million), the introduction of pre-vetting of changes in control, a quasi "fit and proper persons" test, greater power for the ISC to undertake investigations, and a reduction in the period after balance date for submission of annual financial statements.</PARA>
<PARA>That was in 1991. It was not the most activist sort of thing, despite what the Prime Minister postures here at the dispatch box. He likes the headline; he does not like the substance. So we have moved to that point, but very slowly. Mr Trevor Matthews of Legal and General said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the 1980s there was a large amount of so-called key men or business insurance sold on sophisticated tax leverage. . . Also the development of groups of young high-pressure salesmen and saleswomen selling relatively long-term savings plans has created a further generation of clients who are likely to continue to express their disenchantment with their life insurance products.</PARA>
<PARA>This is all fact and was all said years ago. Now we have almost daily complaints against insurance companies about superannuation packages, investment packages, poor payouts and the contribution of the investor. We are gradually moving to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some ways, I guess that to have been too active would not have allowed us to identify what needs to be done. On the other hand, when the community is suffering it seems to me that this government, more than any government, is big on the statement but slow on the action. One can only suspect that, as with negative gearing, banking legislation and tax legislation, the movers and shakers in the Australian Labor Party have their own agenda, their own relationships and their own friends to account for. One only has to look at the areas of media and communications to understand how the minds of the leaders of the Australian Labor Party operate. The caucus committees have no influence. The left wing, which is supposed to be the conscience of the Labor Party, has no influence. So the key people at the top of the cabinet are the ones who make these decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I use the example of insurance to demonstrate the way in which the Labor Party has operated in office. It makes great statements about a terrible thing. There was condemnation of the insurance industry when the Occidental-Regal scam was first notified and then years and years of comment with a gradual movement towards some sort of resolution. Today we are seeing some of the latter stages of that in legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not making those accusations, but it seems to be a modus operandi for the Australian Labor Party. It can be big on the conscience and big on support for the battler until we come to look at the substance&mdash;whether it be in taxation laws, taxation changes or new taxation. We will get another bout of taxation at the coming budget which I believe will just hit for six a community that does not need to be hit for six. The government will not be able to fulfil its promises unless it increases taxation. So whether it is taxation, insurance or communications, the Labor Party is big on talk and little on action. If there is action, it is delayed action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to hear members of the caucus get up and refute that with fact and say, `On this date we took a decision. On this date an action occurred. The following week we took a decision. From that flowed this report, and from that report there was immediate action by the government to endorse a change'. They cannot do it, but I would like to see them try. I would like to see them demonstrate how authentic their government is in these important areas where people's savings and their expectations over years can be suddenly put aside by something like the Occidental-Regal scam, yet shareholders in that company or in other companies have the whole thing paid for. The Prime Minister postures, yet the whole thing is paid for by current policyholders. I do not think it makes sense that current policyholders should in fact pay the penalty for Occidental-Regal, yet they have paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main amendments to the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill 1993 will alter the rules for the calculation of value assets for general insurance&mdash;surprise, surprise; the very thing the Prime Minister and Mr Glading were talking about three years ago. The amendments will require insurance brokers to have an acceptable indemnity contract&mdash;the very thing that the Prime Minister was talking about and making front-line statements about three years ago. They will clarify the liability of insurers for action of their agents&mdash;another one of the matters raised three years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will widen the circumstances in which the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner may refuse to register brokers or councils or may suspend their registration&mdash;a natural consequence of the previous decisions. They will increase the commissioner's investigative powers&mdash;of course, that always happens; the power of bureaucracy is increased whenever something like this is done. That seems an ultimate and logical conclusion: we do not necessarily have to just look at the results; we have to increase the powers of people to do investigations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will introduce secrecy provisions to make it an offence for the commissioner or officers of the commission to disclose information gained in employment. That is very sensible, because they may gain very important and confidential information about individuals and the health of companies. One has only to understand that a run on an insurance company is not a very good thing to occur and that bankruptcy or loss of an insurance company is not a good thing to occur. These laws are going into place. They started in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main provisions under the Insurance Act 1973 and the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984 are the sorts of changes that, as far as I can determine, give the results of the claims of the objects of the bill. In clause 28 we have a new section to increase the powers of the commission to investigate the actions of insurance agents. The provisions are standard nature for investigative bodies and include the power to direct intermediaries to provide information, to require intermediaries to produce documents, to enter premises with consent or with a warrant issued by a magistrate, and to issue warrants by telephone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions also provide that the commissioner and officers of the commission are not to disclose information that has been acquired through their performance of functions under this act except where the disclosure is in the execution of functions under the act to the minister or a court for the purposes of the act, or to a person whom in the minister's opinion it is in the public interest to have that information, or to a secretary or authorised officer of a department for the purposes of advising the minister of that department for the purpose of making a submission connected with the administration of this act. That is a very interesting increase of powers. So we have a customs-like power now being given to our Insurance and Superannuation Commission. I just hope that the raid mentality that customs seems to have will not develop, because abuse of power in this area would be a tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there has been a high degree of cooperation. Generally, except for the activities of the superannuation commissioner, I have been pleased with the professionalism of the previous bodies in general insurance and life insurance. Their supervisory powers have been well expressed. Sometimes they seem to have lacked initiative to investigate certain areas that have been of interest to me, but that is a personal matter and may relate to particular cases that have come to my attention. However, generally they have been professional and well behaved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My beef&mdash;and the beef of many ministers&mdash;has been with the superannuation commission and its establishment. That was one of the most hopeless exercises any government has ever gone into. The turmoil and chaos it caused amongst retirees is one of the most dreadful indictments of this government, and it should have it rammed down its throat on every possible occasion. It was a half-baked idea and it was poorly prepared. It was launched on the Australian community because the current Prime Minister felt it needed to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it was criminal that officers in various cities were required to answer questions that were impossible to answer. Then they left the phones off the hook so that callers got the engaged signal for hours and hours. There were no adequately trained staff. I think it was absolutely criminal to put people through the torture of wondering whether they were going to get a fine from the taxation commissioner. All that was protecting them was a press release from the Treasurer saying that they would not be fined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer claimed, `I am at arms-length to the taxation commissioner. I don't have any influence or control over him', yet here he was with the life and well being of a whole section of the Australian community resting on a press statement. How ridiculous to claim on one hand that he was at arms-length and not able to direct or communicate with or have any influence upon the taxation commissioner and to claim on the other hand that he could control that person by dint of a press release and that taxation decisions on the investments of many retirees were going to be held up because the Treasurer had issued a press release. It was wrong in principle and wrong in application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, let me draw to the government's attention the dilatory nature of the action in regard to these matters. I note the statements that have covered the newspapers&mdash;headlines which have been consciously sought by ministers and Prime Ministers&mdash;as to how they are going to fix the insurance industry. Government members have had three years from the time they started making those statements to rectify that fact. It has taken one year longer than it was predicted at the time, and here we are in the final stages of the process. This is not good administration, nor is it good behaviour. The government has lacked the impetus and the drive. It may come forward in the debate and say, `We had an election'. That has nothing to do with what this parliament needs to deal with. Since the election it has had one year of the new parliament, and it has taken it one year to conclude that work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think this is the standard that Australians want to see from their elected representatives. We have high-flying businessmen and salesmen flogging investments of all sorts, based on inflated valuations of property and buildings that were the very basis of the boom that Australia went through and the basis of poor, unethical behaviour and the expression of greed the likes of which we have not seen in Australia before. The government is part of that, and until now it has not recognised that it has been part, consciously or unconsciously, of that process. The Prime Minister continues that process&mdash;and I believe it is part of his nature&mdash;by using behaviour in this House that Australia bagged Merv Hughes for. He thinks the loud mouth and the carry-on is acceptable here but will condemn Merv for doing it in South Africa. It is part of the same psychology and the same attitude. That needs to change as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to support the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill. I want to point out the enormous ambiguity that the opposition comes up with in these sorts of debates. We hear the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) saying that this legislation is too slow and it has taken too long to get it in and on the other hand that it is not necessary. He says it is a mallet to crack a peanut. I cannot work that out. We have him on the one hand saying that it is not really necessary and then on the other hand absolutely contradicting himself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these debates those opposite have the hide to come in here and start talking about taxation when the reforms this government has made over the last 10 years have resulted in a low tax regime that is competitive, certainly with our trading partners and with the rest of Asia, and in company tax being lowered. We are truly a competitive nation in the taxation sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the last election the opposition had the hide to come in here and talk about taxation. It said, `We are going to come into government and introduce a goods and services tax'&mdash;a massive tax on every aspect of our society. Of course, the Australian people rejected that. Yet here we have those opposite saying, `Your taxation policy has been no good'&mdash;when theirs was rejected. And here they are now, in an absolute void of policy in every area, including the taxation area which the honourable member for Mitchell talked about. So they have an absolute hide to come in here and start talking about taxation and about slowness in legislation when the conservatives did absolutely nothing in the years prior to the Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conservatives knew what was to be done. They knew that there needed to be tariff reform in those years, but they never did anything. McEwen built the tariff walls. He knew that they should not have been there. It was to the cost of his own constituency&mdash;rural Australia&mdash;that they were built. The situation went on and on, and it took this Labor government to fix it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taxation in all these respects is being fixed. The Labor government has brought forward the reforms. It is so ambiguous, so two-faced, of the opposition to come in here and criticise this government for slowness. The reforms are there; they are on the record. They are why Australia is now entering the 1990s and looking to the year 2000 with a new identity, a new means of being competitive. That would never have happened under a conservative government. If a conservative government had been elected at the last election we would have seen the most repressive taxation regime this country has ever had. It is no wonder the Australian people rejected the opposition. We are now seeing a recovery which the opposition does not like. Opposition members whinge and whine about it all the time because they would like to see Australia going down the hole. The sort of talk they carry on with demonstrates that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The general insurance industry operates under the Insurance Act 1973, which provides insurance for a whole range of things: motor vehicle insurance, house contents insurance and third party insurance. Life insurance comes under a separate act, the Life Insurance Act 1945. In June 1993 there were 160 private general insurance companies in Australia plus the government insurance companies. The top five companies shared 49 per cent of the market. The next six to 50 companies shared 41 per cent of the market. The remaining companies had about 10 per cent of the market. Those 160 insurance companies had assets of about $28 billion at June 1993. The government insurance companies had assets of about $12 billion. Premiums were about $8 billion in 1992. So it is a large industry that for Australians reaches into nearly everyone's life in one aspect or another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that as part of the policies this government has introduced in the last few years we are seeing a recovery in the share price index of the insurance category of companies. We have seen that share price index rise 30 per cent from July 1993 to February this year. The opposition does not like to see that recovery. It does not like to even acknowledge it. It likes to tear Australia down all the time. But the recovery is going on and it has been produced by this government. It would be reasonable to take the opposition's line that the recovery would have happened anyhow if we were only running the same sort of average recovery that the rest of the world is running, which is growth of about 1.1 per cent for OECD countries. But that is not the case; we are running a recovery far in excess of that. We are leading the world. There is no other explanation for that than the policies this government has introduced over the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key features of the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill aim to give greater protection to consumers. That is necessary. To many people, insurance is a fairly complicated matter, made no less complicated often by brokers and insurance companies. There have been&mdash;as the honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Snow) pointed out earlier&mdash;complaints, problems and all manner of indiscretions and illegalities that have cost the consumer in the past. This sort of legislation is aimed at protecting those consumers. It is necessary. I know from personal experience that it is very easy for an insurance company to get an advantage over the average consumer. The cost and the complication of objecting to a ruling not to pay out a claim is rather a high hurdle for the average consumer to get over. So there need to be legislative controls, regulations, to protect the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of those controls are contained in this legislation, which is consistent with the government's general thrust towards protecting consumers and making industry competitive and, at the same time, accountable. Subject to appropriate safeguards, the commissioner's power to refuse, suspend or cancel the registration of an intermediary is to be extended in this legislation to cover the situation where the intermediary becomes insolvent or bankrupt, provides unsatisfactory accounts, or fails to satisfy the ordinary obligations of an insurance intermediary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of that commissioner's discretion, regarding the registration of brokers, the industry supervisor would invite the public to place some level of trust in the person registered. At present, provided applicants have not actually been convicted of an offence such as dishonesty, the commissioner is obliged to register all applicants who pay a registration fee and who have professional indemnity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments contained in this legislation will remove the obligation on the commissioner to register delinquent brokers. At the same time, brokers are protected from unfair treatment in the decisions, and those decisions are in accordance with the decision making principles which will be tabled in parliament. The investigative powers of the commissioner will enable more effective investigation of intermediaries. In particular, that facilitates the prosecution of offences against the act by insurance intermediaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another feature of the act is an obligation on multi-agents to declare to all insurers with whom they have agency agreements the existence of any agency agreements that they have with other insurers. That ensures that insurers are informed of such agreements for the purposes of joint and several liability obligations. The legislation also provides for the clarification of the liability of insurers for the actions of multi-agents selling their products. The clarification of joint and several liability of insurers dealing with multi-agents will ensure that consumers are adequately protected in their dealings with multi-agents in a manner consistent with that applying to sole agents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also provides for the introduction of a maximum 37-day period during which agents may hold premium moneys. This replaces a requirement that such moneys be paid to insurers as soon as it was reasonably practical to do so, which was a very loose arrangement and easily able in one way or another to go on for too long because in the self-interest of the broker it was to his advantage to keep that money as long as possible. That provided an additional cost for the insurer, which was eventually passed on to the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirty-seven days is quite a reasonable time. In normal commercial practice, 37 days credit is quite a long period. Most businesses&mdash;most wholesalers or manufacturers&mdash;certainly do not provide that length of credit. Thirty-seven days provides a considerable increase in cost, which has to be passed on through the insurer to the consumer. My only criticism of it is that I believe the maximum period is still too long. Attention should be given to shortening it in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill provides for the upgrading of the minimum level of professional indemnity cover for registered intermediaries by requiring no avoidance of claims cover and run-off cover in professional indemnity insurance contracts. That is required so that people dealing with registered intermediaries are better protected against professional error and/or negligence. Any cancellation of such contracts must be notified to the commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also provides for an extension from one to three years of the time allowed to prosecute offences under this bill. This change is necessary because, by their nature, the fiduciary offences under the act take time to come to the commissioner's notice. The amendments provide for the Attorney-General to also authorise proceedings outside that three-year limit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the provisions of this bill, authority is given to the commissioner to determine the type and form of the audited accounts to be furnished by registered intermediaries and for the clarification of what constitutes satisfactory accounts for the purposes of the act. This also increases the power of the commissioner to inspect documents and to obtain information about the activity of intermediaries, be it for the purpose of routine supervision or prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions of this bill also contain the updating of the penalty provisions in the act. There is the introduction of more meaningful penalties for serious offences, such as a failure to deal properly with premium moneys. The proposed amendments lower the threshold where there is considered to be an association between an insurer and a broker from a test of 50 per cent ownership or control to 25 per cent ownership or control. A number of other minor technical changes are made to the legislation to improve its operational effectiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support this legislation. The way the opposition has come in here and agreed to support the legislation but talk about all sorts of ambiguities is quite amazing. It should really work out that, on policy matters, this government is making the running. The opposition has no policy. Its criticism is without basis. The Australian people are waking up to its real lack of leadership and intellectual ability in attacking these issues. This is good legislation that should be supported wholeheartedly by the opposition and not in a two-faced way. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity while summing up to make a few remarks about the comments of the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) and the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman). I say in passing that the range of measures here do not go quite as far as the contribution by the honourable member for Mitchell would suggest. They should be seen in the constructive and consultative approach that we have taken in developing these amendments. That is important because strong consumer and industry issues need to be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can reflect on the past and what needs to be done for the future. The honourable member for Mitchell has suggested that, through these measures, we are building a whole series of layers of new bureaucracy and regulation. We have tried very hard to strike what is inevitably a delicate balance between the need for prudential and supervisory arrangements and regulation requirements as far as insurance is concerned and at the same time give consumers the protection they need without an overly intrusive arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Curtin referred to a few matters that I would like to quickly respond to. If I can go to the concerns raised about proposed section 9B(3), which provides that professional indemnity contracts must contain a clause stating that insurers cannot avoid a contract or reduced liability on the grounds of non-disclosure by the agent or broker, the question essentially revolves around whether the government has considered the impact of this on the duty of disclosure, which is fundamental to any contract. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the following comments in response. The government considers that the most important issue at stake is that a broker's client should not suffer financial loss because of a broker's dishonesty to his or her own insurer. This provision effectively picks up the point that was raised by the honourable member for Curtin. Further, it will have no impact on insurance policies generally because it is no different in principle to compulsory third party motor vehicle accident cover, which is well established in the Australian and other insurance markets. It protects third party claimants in a similar way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision is also structured so that if an insurer feels that his interests have been prejudiced by an intermediary it is open to him to cancel the policy at any time after notifying the ISC. Professional indemnity insurance cover is a prerequisite to gaining registration from the ISC either as a broker or a registered agent. The government is of the view that very few brokers will risk making fraudulent non-disclosures to their insurers. I believe that the range of measures will ensure that, where difficulty in these arrangements is encountered, alternative cover can ensue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the various issues regarding the combination of the non-avoidance of claims clause, run-off cover and professional indemnity cover, there was a suggestion that it will involve huge extra costs to registered intermediaries and, ultimately, their clients. The concern raised by the honourable member was whether the government has considered the change and its impact on the industry and its clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has certainly considered these issues. It has done so in the context of such things as the recent court decision which showed existing professional indemnity cover requirements to be seriously flawed. The government has a responsibility to ensure that the legislation gives some real measure of protection to those it purports to protect. We are advised that there will be increases in the cost to professional indemnity insurance cover as a result of the amendments contained in the bill and that these extra costs will inevitably be passed on to clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We anticipate, however, that the professional indemnity premiums will affect the claims experience that occurs over time. The matching of claims experience with premiums will provide an automatic competitive advantage to those registered intermediaries which maintain high standards of professionalism. It will increase the quality of services to policyholders who deal with them. Flowing from that, the honourable member for Curtin also raised the issue of fixing these provisions in the legislation regime rather than in the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has made clear the requirement of non-avoidance claims and mandatory run-off coverage likely to lead to increased costs for brokers. The provision relating to fixing the time in regulation reflects the need to maintain flexibility in approach to these matters and to try to judge them as time and experience determine. I would suggest that that is an effective way of responding if particular issues arise in that regard. That is the reason for placing those particular matters in the proposed regulation regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is whether the government is using the professional indemnity provisions of the act to do its work in supervising registered agents and brokers. To cover those issues in response, registered insurance intermediaries have been required to have professional indemnity insurance cover since the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act came into effect in 1986. The government has made no change to the way in which professional indemnity cover is used to protect the public in dealings with registered intermediaries. Important court decisions and the government's experience with the administration of the act have revealed significant gaps in its coverage which will be remedied by the bill presently before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To some extent, the insurance industry's ability to grant professional indemnity insurance cover and to fix premiums may be considered to be an element of industry regulation. This is certainly not a new provision. Commercial and regulatory constraints work in parallel to some extent in all industries in this way. The government sees no reason to introduce special measures to protect registered intermediaries from normal commercial disciplines applying to their own industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Criticism was raised by the honourable member for Mitchell and the issue was referred to by the honourable member for Curtin in relation to the ad hoc legislation provision with these measures compared with the further issues that need to be addressed. It is certainly true that there is a range of issues arising out of the review and inquiries by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and the Trade Practices Commission. As I indicated earlier, in the second reading speech, the important point to be made here is that the government is certainly seeking to have those matters dealt with this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To address the concern of the honourable member for Curtin, the intention would be to ensure that the provisions introduced at that time are consistent with the protective measures contained within the bills before the House today. It will take time to go through some of the other issues. I think it is appropriate to have the protective measures contained in these provisions dealt with, processed through the House and implemented into law with a view to having the other matters, which I would suggest will be complementary, able to be debated by the parliament later this year. Having made those remarks, I thank all honourable members for their contribution to the debate on the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill. </PARA>

<PARA>The Insurance Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 will substantially increase the level of protection for members of the public purchasing insurance products generally and consumer credit insurance, in particular. The bill gives effect to the government's decision, announced in July last year, on issues raised in a 1991 Trade Practices Commission report on consumer credit insurance and a subsequent report by a working party of officials. It was introduced into the Senate in December last year to allow broader public scrutiny of the measures it contained. As a result of this process the government moved a number of amendments involving minor policy and technical issues and these have been agreed by the Senate and incorporated into the bill now before this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major effect of this bill is to amend the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 to make the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner responsible for its general administration. The Insurance Contracts Act was introduced in 1984 to reform and modernise the law relating to insurance contracts. It aims to ensure that a fair balance is struck between the interests of insurers, insureds and other members of the public, and that the provisions of insurance contracts and practices of insurers operate fairly. It lays down a framework for insurance contracts, covering such matters as the duty of utmost good faith and information to be provided before a contract of insurance is effected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act has been self-administering, with no power for government intervention to ensure that it is operating effectively. Administration by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner will ensure that the operation of the act is more closely monitored and, where necessary, enforced. The commissioner will have power to monitor compliance with the act, ensure that appropriate publicity and education functions are undertaken and, where it is in the public interest, take representative action on behalf of consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is introducing this legislation in order to give added protection to members of the public who purchase insurance products. However, it acknowledges that the life and general insurance industries, through initiatives such as those in relation to complaint handling and dispute resolution, have brought about significantly better industry practices. Further amendments to the act are expected to arise from the commissioner's administration and from a broader review of its provisions which is being conducted by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now outline the amendments proposed to be made in the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 now before the House. The amendments:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">make the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner responsible for the general administration of the Insurance Contracts Act, and provide for representative action on behalf of insureds by the commissioner where this is in the public interest;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">require pre-sale, point-of-sale and post-sale notices to be given by insurers to purchasers of consumer credit insurance products. They also provide that similar notices may be prescribed for other types of insurance. These notices will improve the capacity of purchasers of insurance products to make informed decisions about insurance, particularly where it is sold as a part of a complex package involving other financial transactions. </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">provide a 14-day cooling-off period for purchasers of consumer credit insurance products;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">amend section 15 of the Insurance Contracts Act and repeal subsection 87(1E) of the Trade Practices Act to clarify the right of access of insureds to the protection of the Trade Practices Act in relation to unconscionable conduct;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">amend the General Insurance Supervisory Levy Act 1989 and the Life Insurance Supervisory Levy Act 1989 to raise the statutory upper limit of levy which may be collected from $15,000 to $17,000 for general insurers and from $28,000 to $70,000 for life insurers. </PARA>
<PARA>The increase in the maximum levy which may be charged allows for recovery from the industries of the cost of administration of the Insurance Contracts Act. In the case of the life insurance levy, the amendment also provides for the increased costs of supervision that will arise from amendments to the Life Insurance Act which were announced by the government in July 1993 and which are expected to be introduced into the parliament later this year. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures for added protection for purchasers of insurance products generally, and consumer credit insurance products in particular, will result in additional supervisory costs being incurred by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. The Insurance and Superannuation Commission estimates that the additional resources needed to give effect to this package of measures will be $130,000 in 1993-94&mdash;to be absorbed into the current ISC vote&mdash;and $336,000 each following year. These additional costs will be recovered through increases in the general insurance supervisory levy and the life insurance supervisory levy as already outlined. I commend the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Insurance Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993 is the second of two insurance bills to be considered by the House today. This bill was first introduced into the Senate on 16 December 1993. It is claimed to be the product of extensive consultations between the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and industry groups. The proposed amendments aim to increase substantially the level of protection to the public purchasers of insurance products generally and, in particular, those purchasing consumer credit insurance&mdash;CCI.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consumer credit insurance is designed to protect a consumer's ability to meet loan repayments on personal loans and credit card finance in the event of death or loss of income due to injury, illness or unemployment. It is an add-on, sold as an adjunct to a finance contract often entered into for the purpose of purchasing consumer durables. CCI is rarely sold as a separate item. According to available statistics, approximately 80 per cent of CCI policies are sold at the premises of a credit provider. Most of the remaining 20 per cent of CCI policies are sold by car dealers in conjunction with the purchase of a car, along with all the options such as rustproofing and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These proposals represent a major overhaul of the arrangements for the financial and prudential supervision of insurance companies in Australia. Also provided for is a new role and increased powers for the ISC. This proposed legislation follows from widespread dissatisfaction with the insurance industry over many years, as expressed by consumers and the business community in general. The industry, rightly or wrongly, has a bad reputation for commission-driven sales that often show scant regard for the real needs of consumers. The industry has also come to be seen as being secretive and lacking accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is currently little transparency in the activities of insurance brokers, as I had occasion to note earlier this morning. Many of the problems in the industry have been attributed to inadequacies in the existing legislative framework and the lack of powers given to the ISC. The Insurance Contracts Act 1984 is the source of many of these failings. Many of the insurance products sold today simply did not exist when the Insurance Contracts Act was first conceived. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More important is the growing trend toward consumerism. The buyers of insurance products want increased product knowledge and an easier means of settling disputes with their insurers. In the immediate postwar period, customer loyalty was still very much in vogue. In that sort of environment insurance companies were able to concentrate their competition on providing efficient service and underwriting on risk and exposure. Most sectors of the industry were then profitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to Michael Millard of McLarens Australia the 1970s brought about a revolution in the insurance industry, not only in terms of the introduction of newer technology, such as computers, but also in the emergence of a consumer rights movement. Consumers began to win cases in consumer claims tribunals, that had the effect of weakening the common law basis of insurance contracts. The result of this process was the codification of the common law pertaining to insurance contracts in the form of the principal act&mdash;the Insurance Contracts Act 1984. The act has been criticised by consumers, largely because it is costly and cumbersome for individuals to take legal action where a breach of the act has occurred. The bill before us in part aims to amend the act to solve this problem by giving the ISC the responsibility for the general administration of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue of major importance in the bill is disclosure. The ISC has been taking action to ensure that there is greater disclosure about benefits and early exit penalties. Many policies that were aggressively sold by insurance agents contained punishing early termination penalties and were quite misleading about benefits and commissions. In 1991 the ISC issued circular No. 291 which required greater disclosure of the effects of fees and charges on regular premium policies and on early termination. Although the disclosure of the amount of the commission paid was not required, illustrative surrender values had to be given which served to expose the existence of high sales commissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation represents an attempt to address a wide range of problems with the existing legislation. The bill reflects the recommendations of a 1991 report by the Trade Practices Commission on consumer credit insurance. The TPC report said, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is usually difficult or inconvenient for consumers to shop around for the best buy among the alternative CCI products offered by different insurers. This seems to reflect five main factors.</PARA>
<PARA>They are: CCI is almost always sold as part of a package, most retail agents for CCI have sole agency arrangements with a particular insurer, consumers may not have a sufficient incentive to shop around, many consumers find it difficult to compare the value of alternative CCI policies, and there is limited published information about CCI. Some of the recommendations made by the Trade Practices Commission are covered in this bill, including improved disclosure that includes ensuring the amount of commission and fees are clearly stated, a cooling-off period of a minimum of 14 days in which a policy can be cancelled without penalty, and the provision of post-sale information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The TPC also recognised problems faced by consumers in seeking remedies from insurance companies, largely due to the complex and costly nature of legal action. For these reasons the TPC argued that consumers are obliged to rely on compliance with the law by insurers and their agents and enforcement of the law where disputes arise. Unfortunately, no agency has, at present, enforcement powers over the Insurance Contracts Act. The bill gives the ISC these much needed powers, though the TPC initially recommended that the state consumer affairs departments and the TPC should have the role of enforcers. A government working party then set about formulating a legislative response to the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed legislation under discussion announced by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh) on 14 July last year&mdash;as mentioned earlier&mdash;was introduced into the Senate on 16 December 1993. It should be noted, however, that the proposed changes to the existing insurance legislation announced in July last year are more extensive than the measures contained in these bills&mdash;the same point I made in relation to the earlier bill. These bills are chiefly concerned with the consumer protection aspects of the changes that were announced last July and the relevant changes to the ISC's powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are still waiting on legislation to give effect to the government's proposals for the prudential supervision of the insurance industry, although we have been given a broad outline of those proposals. This further legislation is to be introduced in this year, again hopefully in a form that is complementary to the bill now under consideration. Further amendments to the Insurance Contracts Act are expected later this year or even in 1995 following the ISC's experience with administration of the act now to be amended and a broader review of its provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill serves to amend the Insurance Contracts Act 1984, the General Insurance Supervisory Levy Act 1989 and the Life Insurance Supervisory Levy Act 1989. It also repeals a subsection in the Trade Practices Act 1974. The overwhelming content of the bill is concerned with changes to the Insurance Contracts Act. The existing act has been self-administering until now. The government has had no power to intervene to ensure its effective operation. The bill intends that the operation of the act will be monitored and enforced by the ISC. The ISC will have the power to monitor compliance with the act and to take representative action on behalf of consumers. These changes are said to be designed to complement those being introduced by the insurance industry itself to bring about improved industry practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) has pointed out, the bill requires pre-sale, point of sale and post-sale notices to be given by insurers to the purchasers of consumer credit insurance products. Similar notices may also be prescribed for other types of insurance. Such notices aim to assist purchasers of insurance products to make informed choices, especially where it is part of a complex package. There is to be provision for a 14-day cooling off period for the purchasers of consumer credit insurance products. The relevant section sets out the grounds for the cancellation of a contract of consumer credit insurance and specifies the amount to be repaid if the contract is cancelled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments clarify the right of insurance consumers to access protection measures under the Trade Practices Act due to unconscionable conduct. To fund its extended supervisory and regulatory functions, further resources will be obtained by amendments to the General Insurance Supervisory Levy Act and the Life Insurance Supervisory Levy Act. It is estimated that the increased resources needed by the ISC to administer the Insurance Contracts Act will be $130,000 in the current year and $336,000 in each subsequent year. These amendments will increase the statutory upper limit of the general insurance supervisory levy from $15,000 to $17,000 and the life insurance levy from $28,000 to $70,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum explains that this increase in administering the Insurance Contracts Act will focus on monitoring the consumer credit insurance class of business, ensuring the operation of the act is well understood by the general community by means of educational measures and ensuring action is taken to enforce the act where that would be deemed to be in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase in the levy for life insurance companies is to be approximately 400 per cent. That is of some concern as  there is every possibility that if the regulatory functions of the ISC are more costly than anticipated it is highly likely that the levy will be further increased. My colleague Senator Watson when discussing this matter in the Senate noted that the increase in the levy will have a serious impact on the competitiveness of smaller players in the life insurance industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increased levy poses a direct threat to potential new entrants as well as smaller companies. It is generally supposed that new entrants and smaller companies are the most innovative in the development of new insurance products. This industry dynamism is not a feature that the coalition would want to see diminish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments in the bill and the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill 1993, which received passage just a while ago, only cover a small range of the legislative proposals for the insurance industry that have arisen out of the Trade Practices Commission report and that were flagged by the government on 14 July 1993. I understand the remainder of the proposed amendments will appear in legislation to be introduced later this year and they will focus on amendments to the Life Insurance Act. Many of the amendments now before us are designed to be complementary with future legislative changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the heart of both bills which have been discussed this morning is a desire to improve the level of protection afforded to consumers of insurance products. The increased powers given to the ISC and the increased levels of disclosure for consumer credit insurance products are moves in this direction. In October 1993 the ISC issued circular 304 that  furthers the objectives of circular 291, to which I referred earlier, and is a direct result of the TPC report. Circular 304, though not binding, is an influential document that gives an indication of the issues in which the ISC believes some form of regulation is necessary in the life insurance industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The circular relates primarily to information provided at the point of sale. A detailed customer information brochure like a prospectus must be provided and must contain a brief description of the product and benefits payable; an indication of the surrender value of the policy if surrendered in the first 10 years; all fees and charges, including a standardised illustration that could make comparisons between competing products possible; the investment portfolios available; standardised information on investment performance and fund size; and the remuneration, including commission, of the intermediary selling the policy. Although the circular is a useful guide to future legislative changes, it may also be important in terms of this bill. As previously mentioned, the bill requires pre-sale, point of sale and post-sale notices be given by insurers to the purchasers of consumer credit products and similar notices may also be prescribed for other types of insurance. The coalition is a little concerned that the government may use this as a backdoor approach to increase the level of regulation rather than deal with it in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regulation as such need not be of great concern where it can be properly justified, though it must be remembered that increased regulation always results in higher costs that will  be passed on to consumers. Given that the ISC has already outlined a need for greater levels of disclosure in the life insurance industry, it is highly likely that the ISC would use the bill to implement circular 304. Circular 304, which is effective from 1 July 1994, requires that a detailed customer information brochure must be provided. I have already described what it should include. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The insurance industry, and intermediaries in particular, are concerned that they will have to disclose their remuneration. They fear that consumers will regard their income as salary and as not just gross business income from which expenses have to be paid. Other issues, such as disclosure and obtaining remedies, are also important for consumers. The focus of amendments such as these is the protection of consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, disgruntled customers have access to complaints bodies, but complaints bodies established by the insurance industry. The Insurance Industry Complaints Council and the Life Insurance Federation of Australia complaints scheme are examples, yet they do not have the confidence of many consumers. Fortunately, these attempts at providing increased consumer protection have been initiated by the industry and, to date, have not depended on government action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions in this bill giving the ISC the power to enforce the act should be a major contribution to restoring consumers' faith in the regulatory framework within which the industry operates. The insurance industry is one of the few industries that do not have an industry wide independent regulatory structure, even in the form of an ombudsman or an independent review panel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Public disdain for the insurance industry will not disappear unaided. Cynicism will continue, unless steps are taken to restore public confidence in the system and to win back the public's respect and trust. Some in the community believe that the industry shows an arrogant attitude towards them. The reality of this arrogance is not the point, as we are dealing with perception. The public perception is that the LIFA complaints scheme and the Insurance Industry Complaints Council do not adequately deal with the complaints of aggrieved clients. The situation could be perceived by some consumers as somewhat  akin  to  wolves  looking  after sheep. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many who feel aggrieved by the actions of an insurance company have no faith in receiving natural justice from a complaint process operated by industry bodies. They are prone, therefore, to not even lodge a complaint. Only when the public perceives that the insurance industry is regulated by an independent body will it be satisfied that its complaints receive natural justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the industry believes that it currently provides even-handed investigation of complaints, of course it has nothing to fear from the ISC or, for that matter, some future insurance ombudsman. The openness of the industry is important if consumers are to have faith in it&mdash;and it is no more important to them than it is to the industry itself. Mr George Pooley, commissioner of the ISC, has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am confident that improved information disclosure will benefit not only consumers, but also the&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>life&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">insurance industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As customers become better informed about the products on offer, competition will increasingly result in product designs and pricing structures which are more closely attuned to customer needs, and this in turn should generate lasting business.</PARA>
<PARA>Apart from the regulatory aspects of the bill, the ISC is given increased supervisory powers. The ISC commissioner is given extensive powers to require insurers to produce documents and information, under proposed sections 11C and 11D. The proposed legislation states that the commissioner has the power to do all things that are necessary or convenient to be done in connection with the administration of the act. This includes reviewing documents issued by insurers, given in compliance with proposed section 11C, and reviewing particulars, such as statistics and documents, given in compliance with proposed section 11D. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Insurance Council of Australia recommends that the commissioner also formulate guidelines to enable the industry to understand the scope of the ISC's information gathering power. The ICA has concerns about the scope and meaning of certain terminology, particularly with the scope and width of such terms as `review'. The ICA is especially concerned that the commissioner has the power to review organisational structures and even administrative arrangements. According to the ICA, this does not appear relevant to the administration of the Insurance Contracts Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, there are concerns that insurance companies may be required to produce information and documents that are confidential, commercially sensitive or have legal professional privilege attached to them. This is very important in a highly competitive industry such as insurance, where firms are always looking for the competitive edge. It is of concern that confidential information that is passed over to the ISC could be accessed by interested parties using freedom of information requests. Documents given to the ISC should therefore be classified according to the degree to which they are confidential; and those documents that are commercially sensitive should be protected, under the secrecy provisions, from being made public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequence of commercially sensitive information being made public could be immense financial damage to some insurance companies. Unlike section 346 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act, confidential documents of a sensitive commercial nature are not protected by this bill under section 38 of the Freedom of Information Act 1982, which would allow the ISC to refuse freedom of information requests for documents acquired under these provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only types of information that insurers can refuse to supply to the ISC are those that will incriminate the insurer, which are covered in sections 11C(4) and 11D(5), and information pertinent to the insurance cover provided to an individual, which is covered in section 11C(3). Individual information can be accessed by the ISC only where an individual or other legitimate person has made a claim on a policy and has given the ISC written permission for the commissioner to seek information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under proposed section 11H, the ISC will have to give the Treasurer, for tabling in the parliament, an annual report on the workings of the act. That of course is welcome, as always. The report will give the ISC the opportunity to name offending companies, if it so chooses. Naturally, this is opposed by many in the insurance industry, but it does have the full support of the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports the broad thrust of the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993, although we do have some reservations with various provisions&mdash;and I have already mentioned those. The bill provides increased levels of protection for consumers. The improved disclosure provisions for consumer credit insurance are commendable measures that will greatly assist consumers in making sound decisions. Such disclosure rules should be applied to other forms of insurance only where a clear-cut benefit to consumers can be shown to either exist or be in prospect. Regulation should be kept to a minimum, in the view of the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect of this legislation that is a positive development is the appointment of the ICA as the administrator of the Insurance Contracts Act. This administrative role ties in well with the enforcer role where the ISC can take action against an insurance company on behalf of an aggrieved consumer where to do so is deemed to be in the public interest. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we recognise that most Australians use insurance in some form or another. Those consumers trying to understand insurance are frequently faced by a daunting amount of technical jargon. Many consumers, indeed the bulk of Australians, do not enjoy the privileges of professional financial advice which may come easily to some members of this House. They therefore needs some consumer protection, which is provided in this bill. A number of the provisions in this bill will help consumers to be able to understand and select appropriate agents. So the consumer protection and information provisions in this bill are very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is vital that we ensure that Australian consumers are protected, that they feel secure in the knowledge that their insurance will be managed responsibly and that, if they feel cheated, they will be able to access some means of recourse. I am happy to speak in favour of this amendment bill as it will help Australian consumers to be confident that their insurance will be well managed and that there will be legislative structures to protect their consumer rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government made a commitment to reform delivered in this bill after the 1991 Trade Practices Commission report on consumer credit insurance and the subsequent report by a working party of officials from the Trade Practices Commission, the federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. Both of these reports highlighted a number of problems with consumer credit insurance and the ability of individuals to exercise their legitimate rights as consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill brings to effect part of the government commitment to regulate the consumer credit insurance and life insurance industry. Firstly, let me deal with consumer credit insurance. When taking out a personal loan with which to buy a car, furniture or many other necessities, many Australians choose to take out consumer credit insurance. They do this to prepare for the possibility that illness, disability, unemployment or some other unforeseen factor may prevent them from meeting their loan obligations. It is therefore very important that we make sure that borrowers can be confident in the security and integrity of their consumer credit insurance policy. It is our responsibility to ensure that consumers can be secure in the knowledge that their rights will be protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Insurance Laws Amendment Bill and the amendment bill No. 2 of 1994 give powers to the Trade Practices Commission and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission so that they can enforce the Insurance Contracts Act 1984. The Insurance Contracts Act 1984 is the act that currently governs the conduct of insurance companies and their agents. These amendment bills mean that the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner is now empowered to ensure compliance with that act and that will ensure that appropriate publicity and education functions are undertaken and, where it is in the public interest, to take representative action on behalf of policy holders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment there is little consumer protection for those consumers making use of this kind of insurance. Many constituents in my electorate have raised with me their concerns about the charges and administration of their consumer credit insurance and they feel that there should be more direct mechanisms to protect their rights as consumers. This bill will ensure that the consumer is directly protected. The amendment bill No. 2 will give greater power to the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and to the Trade Practices Commission and this will allow Australians to feel more secure than ever before that the costs and operation of their insurance policies will work in their favour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment bills are the result of broad community input. During their passage through the Senate, a number of policy and technical changes were made to accommodate the concerns and problems faced by interested consumers. The amendment bill No. 2 amends the General Insurance Supervisory Act, the Life Insurance Supervisory Levy Act and the Trade Practices Act. An important component of this reform is the right of consumers to expect concise information from their insurer and their agent. Amendments to the act mean that the insurer and the agent must supply information in plain English at pre-sale, point of sale and post-sale to the purchasers of consumer credit insurance. An important principle of this reform is that the consumer should be empowered to make the most informed personal decision possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the amendments to the act give greater powers to the Trade Practices Commission to take action against insurers or agents who make misleading representations. The Trade Practices Commission will be empowered to prosecute an insurer or agent who is guilty of misrepresentation concerning their product. Guaranteeing consumer confidence in the integrity of the information offered to them by their agent and insurance company will restore the credibility of the general insurance industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, low to middle income Australians who do not have access to the privilege of personal legal or financial advice can therefore be confident that they will be able to get clear and concise information about their insurance products&mdash;something which does not necessarily occur at the moment. I realise that many members opposite may not necessarily understand the problems and concerns of ordinary Australians facing this dilemma and that is why this regulatory framework is necessary. I am pleased, however, to see in the House today that there has been general support for the provisions of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians have every right to expect that insurance agents should be subject to the same arrangements as any other provider of a product to consumers. It will be a great source of security to many Australians to know that consumer credit insurance agents and companies will now be regulated by the Trade Practices Commission and that they will be empowered to investigate unconscionable conduct and to prosecute if necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to this bill will make the Insurance and Superannuation Commission responsible for administering the Insurance Contracts Act 1984. The ISC will now have the power to enforce the provisions of the act and oblige insurers to observe them. The ISC will also be empowered to ensure that information is supplied by insurers regarding their product. Furthermore, the ISC will be able to impose civil penalties against directors who breach the obligations of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commissioner of the ISC will also have specific powers, including monitoring of complaints, reviewing of documents and figures, monitoring of legal judgments relating to the insurance industry, and promoting education about the objectives and requirements of the act. It is also important to recognise that the insurance industry itself has come some way along to achieve these aims through self-regulation and controls and measures and codes of conduct. However, I do not think that they have been enough, which is why this legislation is necessary today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interested parties in the industry have had repeated input into the formulation of the amendments in this bill. Obviously, it is not always possible to strike a reasonable consensus between the industry and consumer and there are some disagreements, for example, on the question of whether insurance commissions should be disclosable or not. But I do agree with the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) that a full regime of disclosure, as put forward in this bill, will ultimately lead to the benefit not only of the consumer but of the industry itself as it becomes more efficient and credible in the eyes of the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, some within the insurance industry view some changes here as unwelcome and unnecessary. But the Trade Practices Commission report did identify the need for the public enforcement of the Insurance Contracts Act of 1984, which was simply not</PARA>
<PARA>occurring under the voluntary code that was in place. There is a need for meaningful penalties to be introduced to protect the rights of the consumers. These two bills do give effect to the recommendations of the Trade Practices Commission report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government believes that, if insurers are guilty of precontractual unconscionable conduct, the Trade Practices Commission should be empowered to resolve the dispute, if necessary, in a civil action. The provision of this additional consumer protection will result in some additional supervisory costs being incurred by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. It is estimated that the additional funding required for the rest of this financial year can be absorbed by the current ISC funding. There will, however, be additional costs of around $336,000 each financial year. The general insurance supervisory levy and life insurance supervisory levy will be increased to cover these costs. The ISC expects that the increase will be around $2,000 per annum per insurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original purpose of these levies was to cover the cost of the administration of the 1984 Insurance Contracts Act. The increases in the levies will now allow the ISC to continue this role. Extensive research has found that it is necessary to directly enforce the provisions of the act and to provide the consumer with direct protection. The increased administrative costs are necessary to achieve this end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I believe that this legislation will enhance the credibility of the insurance industry. We do not have to be experts on the insurance industry to understand that there is a great degree of scepticism in the general community. For example, we would not need to have extensive qualitative research into the insurance industry, as has been suggested by Mr Tony Abbott, to know that there is a credibility problem there. It has now been recognised by the insurance industry, by the Trade Practices Commission, by the ISC and by the government that there needs to be action in this area. I am also pleased to say that it has been recognised by opposition members. I am pleased to see that they are supporting these measures; it is welcome support for very important legislation to protect the rights of consumers in the insurance industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I want to thank the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan) and the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) for their contributions to the debate this morning. The Insurance Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) represents a very important change by providing additional protection and the enforceability provisions relating to the ISC's role. To take up one point that was raised by the honourable member for Curtin, this is being done in a way which is meant not to produce a heavy hand but rather to ensure that there is the appropriate level of consumer protection and consumer confidence in the insurance contracts provisions. I think it will be done in such a way that over time the industry will recognise that these changes are in its interests as well as in the consumers' interests, and it will certainly be working constructively to ensure that happens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The range of disclosure of information that the honourable member for Curtin referred to, in circular No. 304, is clearly a matter that we are going to have continuing consultations about to ensure that we get those provisions adopted in a way that achieves the consumer objectives as well as being helpful to the broader competitive structure of the insurance industry. I think that empowerment of consumers can be only beneficial in that process. With those few words, I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That standing order 217 (day fixed for second reading) be suspended for the remaining sittings this week.</PARA>
<PARA>As honourable members will be aware, this is the last sitting week in this period of sittings and after this there will be a six-week gap before the budget sittings. As is normally the case at this time of the parliamentary process, a difficult set of arrangements occurs for managers of government and opposition business as materials flow between the two houses. After these particular sittings this problem will be far more manageable than I can remember for some very considerable time because of the changes to processes that have been put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, occasions will arise in the next two days where bills that have been introduced into and passed through the Senate come into this chamber for consideration. The legislation we will receive from the Senate which we wish to see passed in this sitting involves a number of key bills, including the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill, which will provide for the appointment of the President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Amendment Bill, which will allow the Inspector-General to provide information and documents for a judicial inquiry into ASIS. Other bills, including a health bill, a transport and communications bill and bills relating to the International War Crimes Tribunal, are all going to require, if standing orders are conformed to, a day's deliberation prior to their consideration in this chamber. In other words, we will receive them on one day and be unable under the standing orders to debate them until the next day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the government it does not seem that this requirement really needs decent deliberation in this chamber to be sustained. We must remember that these are bills which originated in the Senate. Any bill which originates in the House and is considered and amended by the Senate and referred back to us can be dealt with forthwith under the current standing orders and no suspension for its consideration is needed. However, bills introduced in the Senate do, as I said, and this change to the standing orders deals with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those bills considered in the Senate have already had due deliberation in the opposition processes because by virtue of their being introduced in the Senate there was a gap between their introduction and ultimate consideration by the Senate. The amendments that have been moved successfully to them in the Senate will also be familiar to opposition members who sat in the chamber while those amendments were considered and voted upon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, whilst it is normally considered desirable that we have that day's gap between the introduction of bills here from the Senate and ultimate consideration, it really is not necessary that this take place for honourable members to effectively inform themselves, given the urgent requirement upon us to conclude business by the end of this week. Therefore, the government is moving this suspension of standing order 217 to make sure the bills that I have referred to and possibly some others can be considered forthwith in this chamber when they are received from the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition does not support the suspension of standing order 217. It is an absolute joke that these much heralded new arrangements that were going to give a sleek, modern, contemporary, into the next millennium tone to this parliament have fallen at the first barrier. This standing order was adopted on only 22 February this year&mdash;not 1894, 1994.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) comes into this place and says, `This is terrible. We normally would give you a day, but we live in abnormal circumstances. We want a bill to sort of facilitate the appointment of somebody who belongs to the broad right wing New South Wales Labor orbit to the presidency of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission'. He expects us to facilitate that! He treats this House with utter contempt. What he said a moment ago was quite extraordinary. It was delivered without a flicker of embarrassment: `Normally we would give you a day to acquaint yourself with the bill, but that is not really necessary'. Why does the government bother calling the parliament together at all? It has the numbers. Why does it not get up at the beginning and say, `We would normally allow you to debate things but it does not suit our convenience'. The whip is nodding his head, which is just a measure of how that mob carries on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a lot of debate over the last few weeks about alleged reforms to parliament and I have heard the Leader of the House wax lyrical and long about just how good the place was going to be under these new reforms. What does he do? He says we do not really need a day. He is doing this because it suits the government's convenience to get the parliament up after a derisory sitting of only three days this week. That is why he is doing this. He is doing this because the government is too lazy to have the parliament sit for another couple of weeks. He expects us to just roll over and agree to anything that suits the government's convenience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the public want us to spend more time in this place. They are not very impressed with arguments that say that the government wants to whip through a bit of legislation because it suits its convenience. The two pieces of legislation in question are hardly matters of national priority and importance. If we were dealing with the welfare of the long-term unemployed or if we were trying to do something about poverty stricken families, of which there are hundreds and thousands after 11 years of Labor government, we might be a bit more sympathetic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government wants us to assent to the Deirdre O'Connor benefit industrial relations bill. It is typical of the adhockery of the government that it makes a change to the standing orders but before the ink is dry wants to amend that change. The government amended the Industrial Relations Act only a few months ago, but before the ink has dried and, indeed, before the new bill has come into operation it finds it necessary to change one of the provisions. The government really must be joking if it expects us to roll over to facilitate that. We will not be rolling over on that. The government will have to get the numbers in this place if it wants to get that passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not agree with the suspension of standing orders. It is a farce. It proves what a montage of adhockery the changes to the parliamentary sittings have been. We said that the new parliamentary sitting times were a joke, and the government is demonstrating that. I think the Australian people are increasingly seeing them as a joke. The last thing we will agree to is anything that shortens the capacity of the elected representatives of the Australian people to scrutinise the government's legislation. The Australian people are very suspicious of the government and they are doubly suspicious of its legislation. There will not be any short cuts by the leave of the opposition. </PARA>

We will settle for those by-election results and public judgments any day of the week. So we will get that out of the way, as it relates directly to a question about what the opposition regarded as public tolerance for this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point that was made was that these issues are coming into this chamber having had no consideration by the opposition. What a load of nonsense! These bills have been sitting around in the Senate for a very considerable period. The opposition has had an opportunity to scrutinise them in very great detail during the last few weeks. The Senate managed to pass no government legislation last week. So all these bills have been sitting in the Senate for a very considerable period. If those opposite are incapable of reading those documents during their Senate consideration, in the opposition party rooms and in committees, that is a judgment upon themselves, not upon the government's conduct of affairs in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) said that these bills are not of sufficient urgency to be considered by the public and that we ought to be putting through bills relating to employment or whatever, as he would consider them to be sufficiently emergent. I remind the honourable member of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Amendment Bill, which allows the provision of information and documents to the judicial inquiry into ASIS. Only a couple of weeks ago, members of the opposition were standing up in this chamber and recoiling in horror that they had no government minister to question on that subject and that it was an urgent issue which required an immediate judicial inquiry. This matter has also been through the Senate and these documents were provided to those opposite, but yet again those opposite require 24 hours notice for their consideration in this place. Normally, the opposition would get that extra time, but it happens to be the end of the sitting period. So those opposite will be deprived of one day out of three or four weeks of deliberation on these materials that they have already had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can be absolutely certain that those opposite would not have exerted any more commonsense by having an extra day to consider the material which, to this point, it would normally have had. The government's justification for this is eminently sensible. Those opposite have had plenty of time to consider these bills. Normally, this standing order would apply to effectively 80 to 90 per cent of the sitting times in this place. This may provide those opposite with their normal excuse to get up and make a political attack on the government, but I do not think they can be serious in any of the propositions that they put forward. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill will ensure a continuation of the government's policy in the area of telecommunications pricing. It will inhibit the development of potential anti-competitive effects and will strengthen mechanisms for enforcement of that policy. The policy was detailed in the government's statement on telecommunications in November 1990 and remains an important part of the measures we have adopted to develop a competitive, world-class, consumer oriented telecommunications industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before addressing the detail of the legislation, it is necessary to put the proposed changes in context. In introducing major reforms to the telecommunications sector in 1991, the government paid particular attention to the need for long-term, commercially sustainable competition to develop in a relatively short period of time. The Telecommunications Act 1991 incorporates an integrated package of competitive safeguards designed to ensure that a dominant telecommunications carrier does not abuse its position so as to unfairly restrict the operation of new entrants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The experience with the current regulatory regime has been very positive. Competition between Optus and Telecom in the long distance and international markets means that in real terms today's prices are, on average, some 40 per cent lower in these areas than they were five years ago. Both carriers are facing price and service competition from Vodafone in the digital mobile market, and even in this increasingly competitive environment Telecom has recently declared a record half-yearly after tax profit of $997 million. It has been able to do so because, as the government expected, competition has not only lowered prices but also driven up demand and has spurred Telstra to improve its efficiency and customer service faster than it lost market share to Optus. As a result, Australia now has a bigger, better, more efficient telecommunications services sector. The achievements are a tribute to the company and its workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, the act as originally drafted has led to some unintended consequences that now need to be corrected in the light of experience in an increasingly competitive market. This is essentially finetuning of a system that is working well. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Purpose of the bill</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In broad terms, the bill is intended to do two things. Firstly, it will remove any doubt that a dominant carrier can offer certain charging options that would otherwise be discriminatory and hence in breach of the Telecommunications Act. Austel, as the specialist regulator, will have a role in determining whether charging options are discriminatory. Secondly, it will enable Austel to disallow tariffs that materially and adversely affect the development and/or maintenance of commercially sustainable competition. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Why the bill is needed</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has become increasingly apparent that a number of tariffs introduced by carriers since the advent of competition may breach the anti-discrimination provisions of the Telecommunications Act in a technical but unintended sense. Telecom's flexiplans, providing usage-tailored discounts to both residential and business customers for a fee, and strategic partnership agreements, providing large corporate customers with volume discounts, are the most prominent of these, although there are almost certainly others that are affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now also apparent that there is the potential for some carrier pricing practices to have the effect of inhibiting the development of competition in telecommunications. These effects need to be addressed to maintain progress in competition, innovation and customer benefit. The government has consulted extensively with the industry to address this situation so as to ensure that, while the integrity of the package of competitive safeguards embodied in the act is maintained, there is no inadvertent prevention of pricing initiatives that benefit consumers and that are not anti-competitive. This bill achieves these objectives. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">What the bill does:</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Exemption from discrimination provisions</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act currently prohibits price discrimination by a  dominant carrier, except where the discrimination is based on differences in costs. The bill retains the anti-discrimination provision, and recasts the exemptions so that the following types of discriminatory tariffs will be permitted:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those that are generally available; that is, of broad appeal to customers and potential customers. Tariffs under which a service is available to be acquired on the same terms and conditions by major customer groups, such as business customers, residential customers or those in a class of persons determined by Austel will be allowed, but those that are narrowly targeted, in such a way that competition is inhibited or the benefits of competition are narrowly focused, will not. This change will, among other things, effectively permit the majority of existing Telecom flexiplan tariffs. There are currently some 2.3 million flexiplan customers;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those where discrimination&mdash;even if narrowly focused&mdash;is, in Austel's opinion, justified by differences in the carrier's costs. Some Telecom SPAs would be expected to be assessed under this provision. This approach provides significant practical scope for Telecom to demonstrate its commercial case to Austel as to the costjustification of specific tariffs. The amendments will explicitly allow broad network cost savings to be taken into account and will provide considerable flexibility to accommodate the commercial realities of the industry;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">(c)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those justified by the community interest in promotion of universal access to the standard telephone service. This would include, for example, existing community and pastoral call rates offered by Telecom; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">(d)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Trial programs, pilot programs and demonstrations, such as Telecom's current trial of calling line identification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of these types of tariffs will require Austel to exercise some judgment as to whether they fall within one of the above categories specified in the bill. In view of the specialised nature of this area of regulation, and the need for swift action to enable commercial decisions to be made, the government wishes these matters to be dealt with in substance by Austel rather than the courts. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Additional pro-competitive measures</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is general agreement within the industry that pricing behaviour that adversely affects competition should not be allowed. The government considers that Austel, as the appropriate independent regulatory authority, should have the authority to act to stop such behaviour. This is particularly important for the development of the telecommunications sector, which is still in a transitional phase from monopoly to competition. This form of safety net is a logical complement to the broadening of exemptions from the anti-discrimination prohibition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, the bill proposes a new power for Austel to disallow a tariff of a carrier that is in a position to dominate a market if it is anti-competitive. To ensure consistency with the government's overall pro-competitive regulatory framework for telecommunications, an anti-competitive test is defined quite specifically as one that would materially and adversely affect the development and/or maintenance of commercially sustainable competition in a market. This test, which only applies to tariffs of a dominant carrier, is deliberately different from those applicable under the Trade Practices Act. This reflects the still developing nature of competition in telecommunications and the barrier to competition that would otherwise be represented by Telstra's incumbent position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that the new power to disallow anti-competitive tariffs will extend to tariffs that are permitted by virtue of the new discrimination exemptions. That is, a tariff that is exempt from the anti-discrimination provisions, for example because Austel considers the discrimination is cost-related, may still be subject to scrutiny and disallowance because of its anti-competitive effects. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Ministerial direction</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that Austel's proposed new power be exercised in a way that is consistent, and is seen to be consistent, with government policy. The bill enables the minister to give directions to Austel about how it is to perform its functions under the new tariff disallowance provisions. Such a direction will be a disallowable instrument. A draft ministerial direction to Austel has been prepared under this proposed new provision, and I will be seeking leave to table it at the conclusion of this speech. </PARA>
<PARA>The draft direction:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">requires Austel to develop, in consultation with industry, a framework and procedures under which it would exercise its powers;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">specifies matters that Austel must take into account in deciding whether a tariff should be disallowed, such as assessing the overall effect on the market of the  tariff, although this list is not meant to be exhaustive;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">requires Austel to consider whether a tariff is anti-competitive, as defined in the bill, if specified circumstances exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to draw particular attention to the government's policy on bundling of telecommunications services by a dominant carrier. Bundling occurs where a tariff contains components of different services, such as uncompetitive basic access and local calls bundled with competitive services such as long distance. It is government policy that a carrier that is in a position to dominate a market should not be permitted to bundle telecommunications services where that conduct is anti-competitive. The draft direction requires that Austel examine all bundled tariffs and decide whether they are anti-competitive. It is important to note that the minister will be limited to spelling out policies and principles and will not be able to direct Austel to disallow a particular tariff. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Period for examination of tariffs</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present Austel has only two days in which to consider a tariff filed with it under the act before the tariff becomes operative. The new arrangement proposed in the bill is that a tariff for a basic carriage service by a dominant carrier does not come into force before the 15th business day after Austel receives it, or an earlier date if Austel so decides. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are no changes to the bill, the minister assures me. I am pleased to have his assurance on the matter. I note that the minister is fairly new to his portfolio but I point out that the Australian Telecommunications Users Group referred to this legislation in the December/January 1993-94 issue of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Communications</EMPHASIS>. The executive director of the group, Wally Rothwell, wrote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All being well, a very important piece of legislation will have entered the Parliament during November, as an Amendment to the Telecommunications Act 1991.</PARA>
<PARA>It is now March and the government is seeking to ram the legislation through this place without giving the opposition time to properly scrutinise it. According to Mr Rothwell, the issues dealt with by the bill were raised by the department `some months ago'. At that time, the Telecommunications Users Group made a submission suggesting some solutions to the problems which this bill seeks to address. In early November 1993, some four months after the time it had made its original submission, the group received a draft bill and two draft ministerial directions and was given four days to comment on it. Despite all this, the bill is only now being introduced into this place. It is appalling that legislation which was prepared essentially in November 1993 is only being introduced in March 1994 with such claims of urgency that it must be debated on the day it is introduced and passed in the current session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill amends the Telecommunications Act 1991 to relax prohibitions on price discrimination and set a process under which Austel will be able to test telecommunications for anti-competitive effect. The bill is designed to deal with the apparent illegality of various pricing options introduced by both Telecom and Optus. The most important of these have been Telecom's flexiplan schemes and the strategic partnership arrangements entered into by Telecom customers. At present, litigation is taking place in the Federal Court in which Optus alleges that the flexiplan schemes and the strategic partnership arrangements are illegal under the anti-discrimination provisions of the current act. The bill will not affect that litigation, I understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 183 of the act prohibits Telecom as the dominant carrier in many service markets from price discrimination in those markets against any person. At present, the only exception which exists to this prohibition is when price differences can be justified on a cost basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is generally agreed that the intent of the original legislation was not to rule out innovative pricing schemes as such, but certain provisions such as section 184(3), which rules out the bundling of two or more services, appear to do just that. Both Telecom and Optus offer flexiplan-style pricing arguments and neither wishes to see them declared illegal. This said, however, there has been concern that some Telecom flexiplans bundle services where there is competition, such as STD connection, with services in which Telecom is dominant, such as local calls. It is clear that in such cases only Telecom is in a position to do this and accordingly it could be seen to contravene the legislation. There is also some concern that discounts offered under Telecom's strategic partnership arrangements with large corporate customers have not been cost justified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Telecommunications Amendment Bill 1994 will take effect from 15 March this year and attempts to address the problems which have become apparent in relation to pricing policies by the telecommunications carriers by removing the more ambiguous anti-discriminatory provisions from the act and seeks to clarify certain clauses. In addition, it broadens the carriers' rights to price discriminate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The anti-discriminatory provisions of the act are to be extended to include `legitimate charging options' which are defined as optional pricing packages which are made widely `available'. In addition, the anti-bundling provision is to be excised from the act. The opposition will be moving an amendment to clause 6(1) of the bill to clarify the meaning of the word `available' in the definition of a legitimate charging option. It is possible for options to be technically widely available yet not possess wide appeal. I notice that in his second reading speech the minister brought these two concepts together, as if somehow or other they were identical. But it is quite possible for an option to be made generally available and yet to have quite a narrow or specialist appeal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intent of this bill is to allow customers access to packages of wide appeal in an effort to increase competition between carriers. Accordingly, the coalition feels that this clarification is necessary. Under the new provisions, Austel may decide that specified discrimination may be permitted if it can be cost justified, is in the community interest in terms of the objects of the act, or is desirable on a trial basis. Such decisions may be subsequently revoked if circumstances change or if the information upon which the decision was based was incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where a carrier is dominant in the market for a particular basic carriage service, Austel will be able to disallow all or part of the new tariff on the grounds that it is anti-competitive. This provision will apply only to Telecom for the foreseeable future and is an entirely new power. The carrier may not implement the tariff for 15 working days after it has posted the tariff with Austel and Austel may disallow it at any time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One section which is of some concern is that part of clause 15 of the bill which inserts section 238C into the act. This section will allow the minister to give Austel written directions on how Austel is to perform its disallowance functions in general terms. The section also states that the minister may not direct Austel to allow or disallow particular tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has only just received copies of the ministerial direction. The opposition would have appreciated being able to carefully scrutinise the tabled version of the directions prior to the debate. The minister can be assured that any subsequent directions will be monitored closely. If they contravene the pro-competitive effect of the legislation, we will certainly move to have them disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition welcomes increased opportunities for competition between service providers. While we&mdash;along with the Telecommunications Users Group, the telecommunications carriers and other interested parties&mdash;would have appreciated a more realistic opportunity to properly scrutinise the bill and the government's proposals, we will not oppose the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to support the Telecommunications Amendment Bill 1994 [No. 2], which amends the Telecommunications Act. It is clear that the telecommunications reforms put in place by the government in 1991 have proved successful. Their objective was to improve telecommunications services and to reduce costs to both residential and business consumers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even in the early stages of competition that we now have, the results have been impressive. There have been significant decreases in prices across the board. Both business and residential customers are benefiting from the changes introduced by this government. For example, the cost of a five-minute call between Sydney and Melbourne at peak rates has fallen by 18.5 per cent to $1.54, and the cost of a five-minute international call at peak rates from Australia to the USA has fallen by 12.7 per cent in the 12 months to 30 June 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A range of new services such as digital mobile, mobile data and satellite mobile have been introduced into the Australian market. Further innovation has been offered by service providers such as AAP, Infolink Network Services, Q-Net, SITA and BT Australasia, which offer a range of services, particularly to business users. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Competition has also resulted in substantial growth in the telecommunications market. The carriers generated revenues of $13 billion in 1992-93 compared with $12.3 billion the year before. The mobile market grew by approximately 50 per cent in 1992-93 to in excess of 650,000 users. There are now over one million users. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has all been achieved while continuing to improve the access of ordinary Australians to the standard telephone service. Austel has reported that Telecom, the universal service provider, is meeting its obligations to provide this standard telephone service at a reasonable price. It is important to remember that the three carriers&mdash;Telecom, Optus and Vodafone&mdash;pay on a pro rata basis to provide universal access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with the government's objectives, Optus and Vodafone are taking their place in the Australian market. Both are rolling out their networks at an estimated capital expenditure of $6 billion and $500 million respectively. This is in addition to the $3 billion or so expenditure proposed by Telecom each year. Optus is already employing over 2,500 people and Vodafone 130 people, with these numbers expected to increase to 5,000 and 1,000 respectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against this background, Telecom is still performing well. Last week, Telecom announced an after-tax profit for the six months to December 1993 of $997 million. It has recommended an interim dividend of $361 million to the government. This is a strong performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is aimed at finetuning the regulatory arrangements to ensure that unintended consequences which have been identified in relation to pricing matters are corrected. It is important that the government take this action to enable attractive pricing packages which do not hinder the continued development of competition. For example, the flexiplans which are used by millions of ordinary residential customers and provide the type of innovative pricing that the government is encouraging will be able to continue, provided that they do not hinder the development of competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will also ensure that community and pastoral call rates, which are longstanding rates to rural and remote customers, and other rates, such as peak and off-peak rates, do not become invalid because they may be considered discriminatory. This is an effective way to deal with unintended consequences which have arisen from developments in the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Briefly, one telecommunications development covered by this bill which has had a positive impact in my electorate is the reach-out trials. Reach-out trials looked at flexibility in the size of local call areas to meet the varying needs of people for telephone usage. My electorate of Corinella contains a large component of the south-eastern growth area of Melbourne, particularly the Cranbourne shire. This area will grow by something like 40 per cent in the next three to four years and from about 100,000 residents to over 200,000 in the next 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cranbourne is partially in the 03 Melbourne telephone zone but also partially in the 059 telephone zone. That has meant that many residents in Cranbourne are in a difficult situation regarding access to telephone books and in relation to the cost of services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telecom and this government have recognised those problems and looked to see what can be done through new technology to address them. Some months ago, I took a delegation from the local shire to Canberra to discuss these issues with Telecom and the office of the previous minister. They were discussed in some detail. Telecom informed us of what it was endeavouring to do to address these situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result is that trials are now being held throughout Australia. Telecom customers in Cranbourne will have the choice of making untimed calls to anywhere within a 75-kilometre radius for a flat charge of 35c. The charge will apply to all calls within that radius. Wonthaggi, Warragul, Healesville, Kinglake, Werribee and Queenscliff all fall within the 75-kilometre radius. This will be most attractive to Cranbourne residents who make frequent or lengthy calls outside the 059 area but within that 75-kilometre limit. These customers will reap substantial savings and at the same time not have to rush their calls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These new charging options are a direct result of the government's communications policies and will give customers greater control over the price they pay. Approximately 11,000 Cranbourne and 4,000 Pakenham Telecom users have been included in the market trial, along with a number of other metropolitan and outer metropolitan exchanges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will not stop there. As new technology develops and a continual change in development occurs, there will be even greater flexibility and improved customer service. As the technology increases in its specificity and complexity, it will be possible to identify individual phones and work out zoning areas. It will allow customers the capacity to really tailor their costings to their telephone usage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that needs to be stressed is that before consumers move on to these sorts of systems they should monitor their phone usage to ensure that they choose the most appropriate option. Many people could look at this and say that, on their perception of their telephone usage, this system will be best for them. But only by reviewing the detail of their phone usage on their bills will they be able to establish the best possible system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This and some of the other initiatives that this bill seeks to clarify and ensure will not be subject to court challenge will make sure that we have a better and a more responsive and effective system.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As usual, the Telecommunications Amendment Bill 1994 [No. 2] is quite interesting legislation. If it is cut down to its fundamentals, it shows that the opposition is again giving the government a helping hand to fix up one of its messes. We are being told that the original legislation did not meet the intention of the parliament. We apparently all knew what we were supposed to be doing, but the original legislation provided to this House by the government did not meet that intention. It has been sifted through by the legal fraternity, and the government has had to come back here, humiliated, to advise the parliament that it got it wrong again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point that I want to make about this legislation is that we are here doing the government's work for it on a second occasion.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I draw to the attention of the parliament is that, outside of a relatively minor amendment, we are not opposing this legislation. We are again prepared to extend a helping hand to the government. This stands in stark contrast to the rhetoric it sends via aNiMaLS to the press gallery. Members of the media confronted us this morning with the question, `Isn't it a fact that when the budget comes out you will be the blockers again?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That particular bit of mythology is not supported by history. As evidenced by the legislation we are dealing with today, roughly 70 per cent of all legislation&mdash;this will be highlighted by the second chamber&mdash;is not opposed by the coalition. When it comes to blocking, it appears that a relatively small percentage of government proposals or legislation is not supported by the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, just to address the history of our support or otherwise for this legislation, the coalition does not do these sorts of things. For instance, the coalition did not run a scare campaign when the government chose to start to sell tranches of the Commonwealth Bank, considering its national identity as an institution. Older people, in particular, saw it as a very important financial institution in government ownership.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation is a response to some of the more competitive actions of government. I argued with the Premier of Western Australia the other day&mdash;as I would argue with Telecom and this government, for a very good reason&mdash;that it is about time governments stopped the practice of shipping people from the country into the city and then complaining about the loss of population in the bush. In making that point, I said to him, `I presume you are now bulk buying your communications and, therefore, it does not matter much where you put people in terms of their ability to communicate or the cost thereon'. He said, `We have a bit of a problem. We have bought one of these packages'. The bundling proposals&mdash;not bungling; that is what we are dealing with here&mdash;were negotiated between Telecom and the state government of Western Australia. Western Australia has been told that it cannot do it anymore because there is currently a case in court. We are fixing up that arrangement. It just might be that by then Optus, the competitor, may have got itself sufficiently established in WA to want to compete in that area. That is fairly positive, but I am also concerned that Telecom is the dominant carrier and as such would have an advantage at this point in dealing with a consumer the size of the state government of Western Australia. Having recognised that those sorts of deals to very large customers cannot be legally entered into at the moment, here we are attempting to fix that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Civil servants keep telling me that they have to be in St Georges Terrace in my state so they can have meetings with one another and get the economy progressing, when I know they do not walk down the corridor to talk to each other; they pick up the telephone. They can equally have useful operating units in my electorate, add something to decentralisation and the lifestyle of other people who are there to earn a living and in that process not be disadvantaged through communications, either by way of technology or cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the one hand, it is a good idea that state governments and others can buy their communications as cheaply as possible. On the other hand, quite clearly, if the competitive system we are establishing is to work, we have to make sure that the little competitors have sufficient business or they will cease to exist and we will get back to the monopoly that we had in the first place. We are looking at ways through this legislation of achieving that. I have not had the opportunity to read the legislation; I have to work from a summary of what is supposed to be in it because of this bill being ambushed into the parliament. As I understand it, Austel will still have a regulating role so that all of these competitive arrangements can be made but not in an anti-competitive sense. That is to be approved. Let us hope it works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) is in the chamber listening&mdash;perhaps he will put forward some arguments in the cabinet from time to time&mdash;it is worth noting that this legislation will allow some very big customers to get some very good deals. Provided these deals are transparent in any business, I think that is a good idea. I have always held the view that we do not do individual deals; we do them on a form. For instance, when I ran a trucking business, we published our rates. They did get lower for big customers, but they were available to anyone who could meet the criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If someone gave us regular business of more than 20 tonnes of freight a month, there was a price for it. If someone wanted to send one parcel a month, it was considerably more expensive. But, as long as these deals are transparent and provided everybody can get a bulk buy, I think that is appropriate and proper. Clearly, there are economies of scale for providers. They should be able to seek big customers provided the terms are otherwise equal, which we are trying to do here. The flexiplan systems are, again, open and transparent for little people, which is good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of little people in my electorate cannot get a mobile phone. Why? It is because there are no stations out there to do anything about it. We are being told at the moment that Telecom and Optus are not expanding those networks because there will be a change in technology from analog to digital. There is a bit of a hiatus at the moment. The matter is somewhere between heaven and earth. As a result, no more money is being spent on analog in terms of repeater stations and nobody in my electorate has got around to building the digital stations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an interesting point, because I wrote to Telecom a couple of years ago when it was running the Chuckie ads. There was Chuckie driving around in his four-wheel drive, in areas far more remote, obviously, than my electorate, being handed a mobile phone that worked. Chuckie was way out from Carnarvon by the look of the terrain. The honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) will tell the House&mdash;he is lucky as he has a big city in his electorate and I think mobile phones work there&mdash;that he does not have to drive too far out of Bunbury or Albany and all the way to Perth&mdash;</PARA>

I have gone as far as to say&mdash;and I guess this legislation could be relevant&mdash;that if country people, such as people in Wongan Hills, who are extremely interested, are not going to get a deal on just mobile phones they will have to sit down with their local authorities and say, `Okay, we are going to farm out as one single contract our entire telecommunications for our shire'. They might be able to go to Optus and Telecom and say, `If we give you all our hardline stuff, what is the price and, of course, will the deal include mobile phones?'. I see nothing wrong with that and I am recommending it to the people in my electorate because it seems that they are going to have to play hard ball to get something they need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess the minister would agree that the present position is getting interesting. It is not going to be much longer before people will not be writing to politicians about their telephone services because we will have no control over them. It will not be a case anymore of talking to the government instrumentality; the government will sell Telecom, which will then have to cope out there in the real world of business. People will have to do the deals that we do with other providers and say to Telecom, `I'm sorry, mate, I'm no longer satisfied with your service. I'm moving to the competition'. I think that will be healthy. This attitude is probably disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always said that, if someone asked me to change the tax law, it would be a bit of a worry. However, if someone's phone will not work, I know I can make a friend. I made an art form of it in the early days of my election to parliament. I want to repeat this interesting point: although through this legislation we are allowing more big deals to be made with big customers, there is a group of Australians not very far from most capital cities who cannot use mobile phones. Something has to be done about it. It should be done even in the context of this legislation because the accent is on more competition. I think some of those people should be encouraged, working through local government, to try to sell off the district phone calls. There would not be a shire in my electorate in which the total business is done on wire and which is getting into faxes and all these sorts of things that would not be very attractive to, say, Optus if Telecom did not want to get on with the job of giving these people a service that they expect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the three minutes remaining to me, I want to make the point that, while Austel is looking at these other matters and using the powers we have given it, a very grievous breach of faith has just occurred in rural Australia; that is, the splitting up of the country telephone directories&mdash;despite considerable opposition from people in country areas. Country people were guaranteed that extra copies of directories, be they for adjoining areas or areas further away, would be free. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telecom is now charging 80c a copy and a $5 administration fee. People can get as many copies as they like for $5. The administration fee applies only once, but the 80c applies to each book. I find that a great breach of faith, because people did not want their directories to be split up as they were. It was done only to guarantee additional <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS> sales. People are now having that promise broken. It might be worth putting on the record, for people who do not understand, that there is a solution: do not buy the directory; ring 013 and let Telecom provide the service free of charge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition, as I have explained, is not opposing this legislation. It is a pity that it could not have been thought through properly in the first place, but I guess that if people do not come from a business background they frequently do not notice what the problems of this nature are, and that is a pity. But my own view is that the changes seem to be for the better and as such should be supported, although I also, of course, support the amendment that will be moved by the opposition, which is aimed at clarifying the word `available' by changing the wording to `available and of broad appeal'. I think that is quite sensible, and I think the government would be wise to take our advice on this issue. If it does not and it does not accept that rather simple amendment, the bill will be back here in a year or so and we will be trying to patch up this particular problem which the opposition has done the government the favour of pointing out to it. We are called `blockers', but frequently all we are doing is saying that if the government does not change legislation it will be back here. Time and time again we are proved to be right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the House for its time, and I sincerely hope that the minister responds in regard to the availability of mobile phones under the new regime and what competition there will be in that area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to speak in this debate on the Telecommunications Amendment Bill 1994 [No. 2]. I think it is fair to say that the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) usually does not make a contribution in the House without drawing a response or two from people on this side. Without wanting to incur your wrath, Mr Deputy Speaker, I shall very quickly run through a couple of the things that he raised. The people of Australia should note that, according to the honourable member, their vote in the last election in rejecting a GST was not a carefully thought out action but was merely a response to what was allegedly a scare campaign. I think this is a very disturbing thing for the public of Australia to understand: the opposition, and particularly shadow ministers, are still as strong about the necessity for a GST for Australia as they were at the last election.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QI4">Mr PRICE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, you did allow the honourable member to wander a little longer than you are giving me indulgence to, and I was going to make only one more point about the bipartisan thing. I might return to it later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it very interesting that when the honourable member for O'Connor talks about community service obligations he is really talking about the attempt by the public carrier to try to ensure that rural and provincial Australians have access to adequate communication services that are clearly loss making. In fact, when this stuff was going through in 1991, the shadow minister, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), was really arguing very strongly that CSOs should be put on the budget and that inevitably these things, whether we had a Liberal or a Labor government, would be cut. I find it very curious that he is now raising this matter. I want to warn the good ratepayers of Wongan Hills Shire that the proposal to let Telecom off the hook was something that was very near and dear to the department at the time. It was suggesting that, where the department or Austel was not convinced, there should be a bidding process for various areas, and Telecom could bid and anyone else could bid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the real point is that Telecom is being let off the hook from paying for the services to be provided. In other words, it would be a financially attractive situation for the dominant carrier Telecom or for Telstra not to provide the services it is currently providing to rural and provincial Australia. The real losers would be the very people for whom the honourable member for O'Connor, quite rightly, wants to provide a better service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does the honourable member really believe that a shire would be able to acquire gratis that part of the network that is operating in Wongan Hills? That is very foolish, even for someone with the business experience that the honourable member for O'Connor constantly reminds us he has. It was a proposal that was bitterly resisted at the time, notwithstanding the fact that it was advocated quite strongly by the department. I think the honourable member ought to try to immerse himself in a little more detail so that he better understands the point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to get away from thinking of community service obligations in traditional terms. Let us use a few cliches. In this day and age, people are going to be either information rich or information poor. A lot of that information is going to be provided by the superhighway, which effectively will be a communications highway. While we used to think of meeting community services obligation through an ordinary telephone service, we are now depriving people in rural and provincial Australia if we do not think about providing the facilities that are required to ensure that all people have equal access to the superhighway. They currently do not have it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are electorates in the metropolitan area, such as my own, where&mdash;notwithstanding the extraordinarily high penetration rates of ordinary services&mdash;people do not have access to these services, much less the enhanced facilities. This is an area not only of communications policy but also of social policy which we could all benefit from taking a closer look at. I make no apologies for having an interest in this, because I have always been conscious&mdash;even though I am a member of a metropolitan electorate&mdash;of the disadvantages that rural and provincial areas of Australia suffer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> To return to the Telecommunications Amendment Bill [No. 2], which did not occupy a lot of the time of the honourable member for O'Connor, I want to place on the record the fact that members of this House should record their appreciation that the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) is the first minister to honour a commitment to do something about this. It is nice to have the words; it is even better to have the action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why are we doing it? Ironically, when competition is introduced, particularly in the case of telecommunications, it is actually necessary to provide more regulations if sustainable competition is what is wanted. That was the case with the 1991 reforms. Even then, it is not always possible to get it 100 per cent right. I think this bill acknowledges the finetuning that is required. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QI4">Mr PRICE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And the market forces, as the minister points out. However, with competition, not only are there lower prices&mdash;and I think we have had a full measure of that through the competition that has been introduced by the government&mdash;but, similar to what has happened in banking, different product packages are developed. That is exactly what has happened in the communications area. This is the precise area that the bill is operating in&mdash;in response to pricing packages for products that were not available to customers prior to 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister said in his second reading speech, the act currently prohibits price discrimination by a dominant carrier, except where the discrimination is based on differences in costs. This will allow for a wider number of exemptions. I will not go through it but I am sure we have all seen the advertising, for example, for flexiplans that Telstra offers. This is an example that would be included under these exemptions. Therefore, I think the exemptions ought to be supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has also introduced a safeguard in the bill to ensure that this set of exemptions does not lead to anti-competitive behaviour&mdash;that is, a situation where a dominant carrier, say Telstra, widens the exemptions permitted for these different pricing packages that have proved to be very popular and that have been referred to by opposition members. Where a new package can be seen to be anti-competitive, the bill provides for Austel to have powers to deal with it. I am pleased to see that the minister still has some say and, in fact, has tabled his draft instructions. I think we need to point out to the House the most important feature of the minister's approach, which I totally support: Austel is not to develop this in isolation; it is to develop it in consultation with all members of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make another point about the reform packages. I guess I am returning to the CSO issue. At the time of the reform, one of the key elements that members of the government saw as absolutely critical, and that in a sense convinced the government to get on board the reform package, was the fact that the government would have an independent inquiry into the deregulation process. After the government has introduced path-breaking reforms, I do not think that members of the government should be in any way embarrassed to get the old thermometer out to check how well those reforms have performed in different areas. That independent review was supposed to look at industry policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I remind the House that we introduced competition not only to get sustainable competition but more particularly to ensure our fair share of exports both in the manufacturing area and in the services area. In fact, an ambitious $2 billion target was set. I find it a little ironic now that some people are suggesting that achieving $2 billion by 1996 is somewhat conservative. It certainly was ambitious in 1991. Look at the way the industry equation is working. In particular, look at the way ordinary consumers are operating. I think it is important that we do not forget about Mr and Mrs Average. Look at how CSOs are performing under the new deregulated regime, look at how Austel is performing and then look to 1997. Certainly the government has a stated policy objective about what is to occur post-1997. Do we need to modify that in any way in the light of experience as a result of this inquiry?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I bitterly and deeply regret that it is the department that is undertaking this review. This is no independent review. There are no people that industry can look to, that consumers can look to or that caucus can look to to undertake this review. It is to be the department. Whether or not we agree with the department, throughout the debate it took a very partisan, ideological view about the review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know these decisions were taken well before the present minister assumed his important responsibilities. I ask opposition members as well as government members: what harm is there in having a review done by people we respect and whose decision we can accept as the decision of the referee or the umpire? I am sure that for a whole range of things the review will say we have got it right. By and large, this reform process and model is being touted as an approach overseas. I am sure that, despite the best will in the world, there will be some things that we have not done as well as we would have liked. That will give us an opportunity for further finetuning, particularly when we take on the brave new world of 1997. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I want to say that I strongly support this legislation. I am very pleased to be here supporting the minister. It is good to see that he has actually done what others have said that they would do. I think that this legislation is in the best interests not only of many very large customers of Telstra but also of many smaller customers and small businesses that have taken advantage of different packages which are now on offer but which were not on offer prior to competition. This is not a bill about the failure of competition. This is a bill about the success of competition, and about ensuring that our competitive environment in communications in Australia continues to grow and to serve the nation, our industry and the people of Australia. I thank the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank all honourable members on both sides of the House for their contributions during this debate on the Telecommunications Amendment Bill 1994 [No. 2]. I will start by responding to the opposition's foreshadowed amendment, which seeks to insert certain words in one of the clauses. The government's concern is that, if we were to agree to the opposition's amendment, that might not remove the uncertainty that we are concerned about. Our worry would be that it might generate more uncertainty rather than remove it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) mentioned in his speech some of the comments that I made about this very issue in my speech, about the way that we have tried to deal with this question about being generally available, and the appeal of particular tariffs. An example given in my speech tried to address this. We believe that we have covered it adequately and with some clarity. I also draw the attention of the House to the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last thing we would want is for some people to argue that, if the opposition's amendment were successful, some particular tariffs could be in doubt. Let us focus on just one small area of the market: small business. At the moment, small businesses can choose between a package called business circle&mdash;which gives them certain discounts for a fee of a dollar per month&mdash;and a second available package called business saver at $50 a month. Or there is corporate flexiplan No. 1, at $65 a month; or corporate flexiplan No. 2, at $100 a month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would not want us to be in a situation where the lawyers were trying to argue that one of these plans was not of broad appeal and was therefore in some legal doubt. I am sure the honourable member for Goldstein would not want the businesses that get the benefits of these particular tariffs to have some doubt&mdash;nor would he want Telecom to be in some doubt and therefore withdraw the tariff&mdash;because of some concern about whether or not it met the definition of broad appeal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government shares the opposition's concern that we want to make sure that we are creating the right competitive environment. The way that we have sought to address that is, firstly, in the words that I have used in my speech, which the honourable member for Goldstein referred to; and, secondly, in proposed section 238A, which says that, if a tariff materially and adversely affects the development or maintenance of commercially sustainable competition, then it can be struck down by Austel. That is the safety net that we have introduced to ensure that we are addressing the issues that the honourable member for Goldstein has raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding the government's difference of opinion with the opposition on the proposed amendment, I would like to thank the honourable member for Goldstein, the House and Senator Alston, who is the opposition spokesman on communications, for giving this issue the attention that it deserves, and for approaching the issue in a sensible way. Despite some of the comments by the opposition about its being unhappy with the timetable which we have worked to, we did&mdash;as I think the honourable member for Goldstein conceded&mdash;provide the opposition with the draft bill last week, once it was through cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister, the honourable member for Goldstein, referred to some comments made by ATUG&mdash;I think he mentioned that it was in a December or January edition of its magazine&mdash;to the effect that ATUG had seen the draft legislation and that it was expected to be introduced in November. The honourable member for Goldstein therefore had some criticisms of the government and perhaps even of me as the minister for the fact that, although the legislation had been foreshadowed in November, it was now appearing in the House only just before the break. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason the legislation did not appear in November is that this package is different from the proposals which were around in November. The former minister for communications, the current Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall), announced in September that the government would be legislating to protect flexiplans that were generally available. Yes, those amendments are included in this package, but it was not until late last year that the industry advised the government of difficulties with SPAs, the strategic partnership agreements, and that required quite lengthy and detailed consultation not only with Telecom but quite rightly with Optus, Austel and other stakeholders in telecommunications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the reason that legislation which may have been provided for discussion with industry in November is very different from the legislation before the House today. One clear example is the provision for Austel to be the forum in which decisions are made about the cost justification of packages such as SPAs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also noted the concern of the shadow minister, the honourable member for Goldstein about the removal of section 184(3). His concern was that that was an anti-bundling provision, and that removal of that provision would raise concerns in the opposition's mind about the impact of competition. Section 184(3) was inserted in the act to protect resellers, and our concern is that there is some legal advice indicating that the meaning is very uncertain and it may invalidate some very desirable tariffs, including the most common of the flexiplans, family and friends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition claims that this is an anti-bundling provision, but it was never intended to be one. The government's policy in relation to bundling is made clear in the package: bundling is to be prohibited if Austel considers that it has an anti-competitive effect; and the proposed ministerial directions specifically require Austel to examine bundled tariffs. So I hope in that way we are addressing that issue which has been raised by the shadow minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Goldstein also expressed concern about section 238C, which gives the minister power to direct Austel in relation to its disallowance powers, and he was concerned that the opposition had not seen the draft direction until I tabled it in the House this morning. I should remind the House that it is still a draft direction on which it is a fact that the industry has been consulted, but it remains a draft. The direction will not be final until the legislation is passed by both houses and given assent, and the direction remains a disallowable instrument. So at some time in the future when the final direction is issued, if the opposition has a difficulty with the final direction, it could seek to have it debated in either house of the parliament since it is a disallowable instrument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), with a little bit of rhetoric, accused the government of not getting its policies right and said that the fact that we were moving amendments to the Telecommunications Act was evidence that the government's initial policy was wrong. I simply make the point that this legislation ensures that the original policy stands. We are amending the law to ensure that the government's policy allows for the development of greater competition in telecommunications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member went on to express some concerns about the availability of mobile phones in his own electorate. I would make the point that we have had a dramatic increase in the number of Australians who are using mobile phones&mdash;from 650,000 in 1992-93 to over one million users today. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am not sure whether you are one of the users&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer to the honourable member for O'Connor may be a new telephone package which may be available through Optus in the not too distant future which provides for mobile telephony to be provided through Aussat, through the satellite system. It will not be cheap because it will have to recover the costs of using the spectrum concerned but I do know that Optus has been working on a mobile telephone system that could be used by a farmer who was driving in the remote parts of the honourable member's electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, concerning the comments made by the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), I note that he and his family have a very keen interest in telecommunications matters. He was very kind in his comments towards me but I would make the point that the Minister for Resources initiated the government's action in this area with his press release in September last year. And as I mentioned, until the issues were raised with the government about strategic partnership agreements it had been intended that legislation would be finalised in November last year. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is difficult to understand in a society so highly regulated by this government, and given the powers of the Australian Securities Commission, that this situation was allowed to develop at all. The present deterioration in the position of the company reflects badly on this government, its regulators and the bankers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The end result is that 5,000 investing Australians are holding the can for the ineptitude of all those I have named. Over 50 of those investors come from in and around my own city of Mackay, and it was one of them, Mr Aldo Rover, who, when in Canberra and wanting to view his investment, was told that Tumbarumba had been sold; that the buyer company, Forestell, was in liquidation; and that the land was mortgaged to the bank. All this time there was no report to investors, and many were still paying off their management fees in instalments to the same bank that had&mdash;unknown to the investors&mdash;lent money on their security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of the facts that come from the reports. Firstly, the investors in Tumbarumba are typical. A glossy prospectus, apparently approved under the Australian Securities Commission guidelines, promised 1,000 per cent return on money invested. Some prospectuses issued by the group were deliberately misleading in that loans from a group, Equus, were not mentioned. The investors were never fully consulted by report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the Australian Securities Commission did nothing in this matter of prospectuses or about the fact that it was aware of the failures of many of Forestell's other schemes. Thirdly, while what the National Australia Bank did in securing by mortgage the former Tumbarumba land on an original loan of $850,000&mdash;which has now blown out to $1.5 million&mdash;might be said to be normal banking practice, that bank must have been aware of the prior right of licence holders of timber on that land to secure their interests. I would have thought it prudent business for a bank aware of these licences not to make a loan unless it had the knowledge and approval of the investor licence holders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lastly, the government and the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) are aware of the deficiencies in legislation and the deficiencies of the government's corporate watchdog. The government also must in some way be responsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Forestell is in the hands of the liquidators and, on my understanding, the land is in the hands of the bank, and other companies have an interest in the split-up of the assets, I believe there is a way through this if reason and justice are to prevail; that is, while it is acknowledged that the investors do not own the land but have licences over the timber on it, an opportunity should be given for them to protect their asset by having the opportunity of acquiring the land. In no way should their rights be compromised by a sale of land that does not recognise those rights and licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Five thousand small investing Australian battlers deserve better treatment than this. I believe this Attorney-General and this government can ensure that better treatment, and appropriate action against those who neglected their responsibilities and those who deceived their investors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a second matter I wish to address, concerning correspondence between a constituent of mine, Mr Brian Herne of Australian Cattlefacts, and the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the present Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean). Letters of 23 September 1993 and 7 December 1993 from Mr Herne to the minister have not yet received any official response. Although I realise that the ministerial portfolio has now been transferred to Senator Bob Collins, it does little to recommend the efficiency of this department to realise that the originating letter is now over six months old. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Herne, the constituent, formerly published a magazine, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Livestock and Property</EMPHASIS>. In one of its articles, of May-June 1991, there was heavy criticism of Ausmeat and its blunder for continuing with butt profile. The major critic of that system, according to the article, was Dr Ray Johnson, an internationally recognised meat specialist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then, and with the backing of local graziers&mdash;there have been no government supporting funds for this project&mdash;Mr Herne has researched and developed a system, Cattlefacts Market Intelligence, and has on repeated occasions explained the system to the Cattle Council of Australia, the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, the Cattlemen's Union, the Australian Graziers Association, ABARE, Ausmeat and many others that he thought should be interested. But the latest information is that the Meat Research Council is to use research funds to implement Cattlefacts under another name. It intends to reinvent the Cattlefacts wheel but there has been no invitation to Mr Herne to assist, research or tender for the program in any way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this background, I now go back to the letter to the then minister of 23 September, which made substantial claims. I will read from the first two paragraphs of that letter. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been brought to my attention that individuals in the Cattle Council of Australia appear to have acted corruptly either alone or in collusion with others, in that they have stolen a private commercial cattle marketing strategy called "Australian Cattlefacts" from myself and cattlemen I represent, and are offering it to the cattle industry as their own and seeking industry funding to research, develop and implement it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am requesting, on advice from the Trade Practices Commission and others, that you immediately take measures to stop progress of this theft and deception and that you instigate a full police inquiry into the circumstances, the organisations and the individuals who appear to be involved.</PARA>
<PARA>These are substantial claims. I am advised that the marketing scheme, Cattlefacts, or any of its equivalents can only be properly managed and serviced through private sources. A government agency would not have the respect or quality or the disciplines of a private agency and this is borne out by the inadequacies and high costs of services carried out by various quangos already in meat inspection and assessments, and by the quality of some of those quangos' market research. In spite of this, the Meat Research Council will insist on spending taxpayers' dollars to run a program identical to Cattlefacts. The advice of the Trade Practices Commission that was sought and given is relevant, namely, that the minister take steps to stop progress of this theft and deception and that a full police inquiry into all the circumstances and organisations and individuals concerned be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last matter I wish to address is a letter of complaint I received. The letter was addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) as minister for the aged. The letter was under the signature of the administration officer of a not-for-profit nursing home in my electorate and bears out complaints I have had from other constituent not-for-profit nursing homes. I wish to read relevant extracts from the letter. The letter says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In June of 1993 Commonwealth Nursing Officers . . . visited our Nursing Home as the RCI Review team. This team determined that sixteen (16) of our residents were to be de-categorised because of insufficient documentation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . they were not prepared, nor had the flexibility or desire, to change their assessment because the correct forms were not used to support the initial category.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Specifically, this documentation related to flow charts and care plans for which we had no prior direction or knowledge.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . your department can drop the category of any resident by only one category, but we are unable to apply to have the residents category upgraded unless we can justify an increase of two categories. This regulation is unjust, and impossible to achieve, as your department chooses who they will assess.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter further continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We were even accused of not understanding the funding system of CAM, nor being able to control it. Our understanding of it is enough to know that it is unjust and biased.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We sent a letter of complaint to the Manager of that office dated 20 December, 1993 and his reply of 23 February, 1994 bluntly informs us that, because we did not appeal, that the decisions of the RCI review are confirmed and cannot now be contested. It appears quite clearly that the priority of your department is in withdrawing financial support wherever possible for our aged in Nursing Homes, than over the care and concern of their needs and dignity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, we had the same RCI Review team visit our `Home' and de-categorised four more of our residents . . . one reason for his category to be lowered was because he could not put on his own pajamas. In a sense he can do this, but when he puts two legs into the one section, or tries to wear his bottoms as a top, then do we leave him like that, allowing him the freedom, or do we assist in dressing? </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sir, we strongly request an urgent review of the regulations and guidelines of the Resident Classification Categories. We consider the present system unfair, unjust and biased against the philosophies and principles of the Nursing Home, and the needs and dignity of the residents. . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we extend to you an invitation to visit our `Home' so that you may familiarise yourself with the difficulties we encounter, especially after reviews from an RCI team that is biased, inflexible and unhelpful.</PARA>
<PARA>This complaint has much in common with many other complaints. In the 3 1/2 years that I was the shadow minister for aged care, I was repeatedly told of similar aggressive and uncompromising bully tactics used by the departmental officers. The complaints in this letter are typical of the complaints I have heard and they should be put on the record. More particularly, it should be realised that almost 100 per cent of nursing homes are caring places. They provide a necessary community service for the aged, and attention needs to be drawn to this matter. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is commonly remarked that members of the community often feel a sense of alienation from the political process. People in many countries have lost confidence in the capacity of governments to cope well with current trends. However, there are many activities of government which give people cause for hope. I want to report on one of those; that is; the United Nations is going to hold the World Summit on Social Development in Copenhagen in March next year. The Australian government strongly supports the holding of that conference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people are experiencing an increased sense of anxiety about social trends. High unemployment is causing loss of capacity for self-reliance, as well as loss of dignity amongst the unemployed. Sickness, family breakdown, substance abuse and even suicide can be consequences of unemployment. Unemployment is also the principal cause of poverty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Conflict within families and family breakdown are commonplace. Violence in homes and communities is widespread. In many countries, ethnic violence is increasing. Inequity is growing and gender discrimination persists. Minorities, such as Aborigines and recent migrants, commonly continue to feel excluded. All these factors are contributing to a generalised sense of insecurity and uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many causes of these characteristics of societies, but one which is receiving increasing recognition is the neglect of the social consequence of narrowly focused economic strategies. In many countries there has been a preoccupation with economic growth in ways which have involved neglecting the impact on communities and individuals and the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recognition of these problems has led the United Nations to decide to hold a world summit on social development next year. As the United Nations is a gathering of all nations, it reflects the attitudes of existing governments. This summit is going to be a landmark in social development policy. The three core issues to be discussed at the conference go to the heart of the causes of anxiety which many people are experiencing. The three core issues are: ways of aiming to increase productive employment; ways of alleviating and reducing poverty; and ways of enhancing social integration, particularly of disadvantaged and marginal groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the beginning of February, the first preparatory conference for the world summit was held in New York. I attended that conference as part of the Australian delegation. That conference decided to add two major themes to the discussion, thus making a total of five core issues. The fourth issue is an enabling economic environment: the importance of economic policies, of economic development which will allow progress towards creation of employment, creation of greater security of income, so that poverty is reduced and social integration is strengthened. The fifth issue was discussion of the structures and policies of the United Nations system and the international financial institutions which are part of the UN system, such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Participants in the first preparatory committee recognised that the seriousness of current social problems requires the development of a new common vision for the future of humankind in which partnership and the search for the common good link with social development, improved living conditions and the resolution of all forms of conflict. The aim of increasing human security is a striking and succinct way of expressing those goals. Human security is what most people in the community fundamentally want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central focus for the summit is to be the recognition that economic development is only a means to an end, not an end in itself; that development must be people centred so that human security, freedom and justice become the principal goals of societies, governments and the international community; that social and economic development are entirely interdependent&mdash;social development cannot be left until the end of the process of economic development but each has to occur simultaneously; and that improvements in equity must receive as much attention as growth of efficiency. Commonly it is said by narrow economists that we have to concentrate on efficiency and leave equity till later, but there are many policies and many ways of approaching economic strategies which ensure that improvements in equity and efficiency can be achieved simultaneously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An ethical perspective on human affairs is necessary, where dialogue and tolerance replace violence, where human dignity is the central value and the spiritual and cultural aspects of the human condition are encouraged harmoniously with the material in a context of good government. The urgency of addressing the core issues must be obvious to everyone. It must also be clear that they are interdependent. I shall deal with employment first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing increases poverty or damages social cohesion more powerfully than unemployment. Lack of opportunity to work is the principal cause of crime and street violence. The first requirement for an effective strategy to achieve opportunities for work for all who want it is the commitment to the goal of full employment. National governments must adopt policies which concentrate on expanding employment opportunities. This would be more feasible in an encouraging global economic environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Detroit summit of the G7&mdash;which was held the week before last and about which the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) spoke to the House yesterday in question time&mdash;is a very important symbol of the change in attitude, with the emphasis now being given by all major countries, including Australia of course, to growth of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the achievements of the Australian delegation to the first preparatory conference was to encourage the summit secretariat to commission a paper which will discuss ways of increasing international cooperation so as to stimulate growth of employment. If all major industrialised countries simultaneously adopted more expansionary macro-economic policies, this would be mutually reinforcing, as the exports of all would rise, so avoiding the danger of increasing current account deficits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second theme is about poverty. Reduction of poverty also requires both national and international action. For example, in all countries, improvements to education and training are vital. As John Kenneth Galbraith wrote recently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is in our time no well-educated, literate population that is poor, and there is no illiterate one that is other than poor.</PARA>
<PARA>So it is vital to build up education and training everywhere. Vital too is the provision of basic infrastructures such as transport, clean water and community health services. They are central, straightforward goals that many developing countries are now adopting. We must encourage all such countries to adopt them and help with resources so they can achieve their goals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another requirement for the reduction of poverty is ready access to credit, so that people with the initiative to start small businesses can get access to the capital to enable them to do so. Another, of course, is the importance of land reform in many developing countries because agricultural poverty is one of the major problems in many of them. These are some of the policies which will empower the poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third goal is social integration, which can be enhanced by attempting to ensure equality of opportunity through, for example, equity of access to all community services. Central to that too is the universal availability of education. So there are many policies which we in Australia can adopt, which we can advocate at the international level and which will be the subject of this important summit. I look forward to reporting to the House in due course on the developments in planning for the summit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Political women were right to be angry when, as was reported in our daily newspapers, Prime Minister Keating recently dealt flippantly with the issue of cabinet representation of women during a caucus meeting. We are informed that when questioned by one of his own female backbenchers regarding designating a high profile minister as `Assisting the Prime Minister on the Status of Women' following the resignation of the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) from cabinet and the ministry, he gave a silly reply about British MPs&mdash;apparently referring to the bizarre death of a member of the House of Commons. The import of his answer was that if he put on a skirt then&mdash;in the United Kingdom, at least&mdash;he could adequately fulfil this role. The dismissive, degrading and derisory nature of the statement angered many women including those in his own party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Prime Minister has got off altogether too lightly on the subject of the standing that he has accorded women, both within parliament and outside. Posing as a drag queen will not give him any greater insight or credibility regarding the particular challenges facing Australian women today. Twenty-four hours later he tried to dress up his response as anti-sexist. However, he cannot escape the fact that his leadership of the Labor Party has not given him the necessary credentials to get away with such an outrageous response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue is not whether or not the job of the honourable member for Canberra should be taken over by a woman minister, it is that Paul Keating cannot credibly take it on. He reveals that whenever he speaks&mdash;other than to a prepared script&mdash;and there is no better example of it than his caucus faux pas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter of his attitudes&mdash;as expressed by his government's policy&mdash;towards Australian women is something that time will not permit me to deal with today. It will be the subject of many debates in the life of this parliament, I am sure. The issue that I wish to pick up is that of the present political status of women in this parliament, and particularly as it has been treated by the parliamentary Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This week has seen the swearing in of a new woman member of the House of Representatives&mdash;the former Western Australian Premier, Carmen Lawrence. I welcome the election of a woman of Dr Lawrence's status and wish her well in her time in this place. However, the hoopla that has surrounded her election only serves to distract from the present parlous state of women Labor members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are those in the Labor Party who are beating a drum about an objective for that party to have 50 per cent female representation in parliament by the year 2000. Loudly proclaiming this objective has obscured the simple fact that parliamentary representation of and&mdash;even more importantly&mdash;power sharing by Labor women in the national parliament has not been living up to the party's rhetoric for years. In general terms Labor women MPs fared rather better under Prime Minister Hawke than has been the case under Prime Minister Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that the Labor Party factional system does not assist the advancement of its women. They appear to have long since hit the so-called `glass ceiling'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When former Prime Minister Hawke insisted after the July 1987 election that the number of women in his ministry be increased from one to three, he could not get this result from the three factions. Those who run the factions&mdash;all men&mdash;had their favourite male candidates and were not prepared to extend their support to any of the women MPs. Prime Minister Hawke had to increase the size of the ministry in order to add the two further women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Ryan resigned from parliament in January 1988, her faction proposed a man to replace her. Following the March 1990 election, Mr Hawke promoted the honourable member for Canberra into the cabinet. However, he could not persuade the Centre Left faction to include a woman amongst its candidates for the ministry, despite that faction having the opportunity to put forward new people. It was not until the present Minister for Consumer Affairs forced the issue, following Senator Richardson's resignation from the ministry in 1992&mdash;her candidature was clearly against the wishes of Prime Minister Keating&mdash;that the number of women in the ministry was restored to three, the previous status quo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be no doubt at all that several men have been promoted to the ministry over the last six years who are inferior to at least some of the women who have been forced to languish on the government's back bench. Furthermore, of the present 10 government parliamentary secretaries&mdash;the ministers-in-waiting&mdash;the Prime Minister has seen fit to appoint only one woman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the Keating government, the parliamentary gains for women have been more apparent than real. This is illustrated by some tables I have prepared which show the number of women members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives for all parties since the beginning of the 1980s. At the end of my speech I shall seek leave to have these tables incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the early 1980s, the number of women Labor representatives did increase, but, as from 1985, the situation in the Senate has essentially been one of decline. In the House of Representatives there has been some fluctuation, resulting in only a modest increase of two between 1987 and 1994 (including Dr Lawrence's recent election). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the total number of Labor women in parliament has increased, it too seems to have plateaued in the same way as its number of women ministers&mdash;the increase is almost wholly due to the very modest progress in the House of Representatives that I have already outlined. In the light of these facts, claiming an objective of 50 per cent female representation by the 21st century clearly is more a case of hype for public consumption rather than reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that, whilst women account for nearly 14 per cent of Labor Party parliamentary representation, their three ministers (assuming that the honourable member for Fremantle will be a minister by the end of this week) and one parliamentary secretary amounts to only 10 per cent of ministry appointments. A poor result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the jockeying that has this week surrounded the forthcoming ministry changes, it is noteworthy that the second vacancy is to be filled by yet another male candidate nominated by the Right faction. Whilst I have no axe to grind with the honourable member for Bowman, it is surely obvious that there are other women who are equally capable of this job&mdash;and certainly other Queensland women, if having a Queenslander is to be an overriding factor. For example, why has the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) never been appointed as a parliamentary secretary, and thus given the opportunity to indicate whether she has ministerial capabilities? She is a hard working member who came to this parliament with credentials equal to most of her colleagues and she has been consistently ignored. Affirmative action is obviously a sham within the parliamentary Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the coalition, women represent 11 per cent of parliamentary membership&mdash;in the case of the Liberal Party alone, 14 per cent&mdash;but hold 16 per cent of shadow ministry positions: six shadow ministers and one parliamentary secretary. Leader of the Opposition John Hewson has never been given any credit for this by the press or women's groups, a fact which tempts me to say that reporting on the issue of women and power sharing in the parliament is particularly one-eyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there are other positions of authority within this parliament in addition to that of membership of the frontbench. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party has made much of the fact that it has had a female Chairman of Committees and Speaker of the House of Representatives. However, since the retirement of the former honourable member for Lilley, Elaine Darling, as temporary Chairman of Committees, there have been no women on the Labor side given the opportunity to train for one of these positions of authority&mdash;it has remained exclusively a male preserve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nor has it ever seriously attempted to identify a woman President of the Senate, despite using a couple of its women senators as temporary chairmen of committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party has never had a female whip in either the House of Representatives or the Senate&mdash;apparently the Labor fellows cannot handle being given their riding instructions by a woman. I see you smile, Mr Deputy Speaker. There have been several women whips in the Senate from the coalition ranks: four Liberal and one National Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as appointing a record number of women to his frontbench, instead of setting spurious numerical goals, last year the Leader of the Opposition initiated within the Liberal Party moves towards identifying and training more women candidates. As I predicted at the time, the effect of encouragement from the top to would-be female candidates has had an immediate, strong response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to being joined in this Parliament by many more female Liberal colleagues, whilst the Labor Party no doubt will be putting its major objectives into continued window dressing of a party which, at heart, cannot handle real power sharing with women. The obvious first step for them to take would be through their factions. However, there is no suggestion that change is going to take place at that level. No wonder the discouragement amongst Labor women is presently so strong that they have had to depend on high profile women like Joan Kirner and Carmen Lawrence to get the attention of their co-party members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak of the youth situation in northern Tasmania and in particular in the city of Launceston. First, I would like to bring to the attention of the House the operations of a drop-in centre called Youth Unlimited. Youth Unlimited has in recent months undergone some very turbulent times. It has had problems finding a permanent home but now, due to the tireless efforts of those involved, a permanent home has been found in St Johns Street. Support for the Youth Unlimited Street Relief Workshop has come from all aspects of the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Websters, who own the property, have given Youth Unlimited heavily reduced rent for six months. The Launceston Federal Casino has donated carpet for the centre, and service organisations of Launceston are giving freely of their time and efforts for the centre. In fact, the centre had the resources to get just about everything: everything but the kitchen sink, so I made a donation to buy that. Cooperation like this is a real example of community spirit at work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me highlight to the House why a centre such as this is so important to the youth of Launceston. I would like to quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Launceston Examiner</EMPHASIS> of 7 May 1993, from a time when it was thought that Youth Unlimited might close:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Christine Percy is a young, single mum who would be very alone if Launceston's Christian Outreach Centre was forced to close the doors of its Youth Help Centre.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With her baby girls, Teri (10 weeks) and 18 month old Toni, Miss Percy said yesterday that she would be "isolated and lonely" without the Youth Unlimited Street Relief coffee shop in St Johns Street.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"I live at Rocherlea and if I couldn't come here I'd be doing nothing" she said. "I'd go silly sitting at home. I would hate it."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without the crowded, two-room, volunteer-run coffee shop, Miss Percy, 23, believes that her age and children would bar her from any other help organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"It is like a family here."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A regular, like Miss Percy, at the centre, Mr King said that the friends he'd made at the coffee shop had given him something to occupy his time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Without this I'd be hanging around town doing nothing in the Mall or outside Target", he said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"When it closes I go home and be bored out of my skull for a couple of hours', he said.</PARA>
<PARA>These examples highlight the need in human terms for this service and services of this nature. That is why initiatives such as this should be supported heavily by government at all levels. I mentioned earlier that there was potential at one stage for the Youth Unlimited service to close. During periods when the centre was closed, the level of disturbances in Launceston's Brisbane Street Mall and around the city increased notably. There is no better argument than this for the Youth Unlimited Centre to be maintained and supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish to bring to the attention of the House another example of community support in northern Tasmania, for the problems of our youth. I quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Examiner</EMPHASIS> of 13 February this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Steve Cloudsdale has quit the Launceston City Mission to pursue a mission of his own.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">His dream is to provide a place for young people with hard lives to learn love and security&mdash;a youth farm.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The former Evandale Hospital, where old people once retired, will be a place for youth to rebuild.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The hospital infrastructure is like the young people who will live, grow and work there&mdash;in need of care and repair.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Faded signs protesting against the controversial closure of the hospital 18 months ago remain on the property, as do signs of daily hospital life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`It looks like an institution. But we'll change all that, we'll get rid of things like the hospital curtain rails on the ceilings,' the former superintendent of Launceston's City Mission said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The youths, aged between 15 and 18, will pay board, and work on the farm and the buildings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`In turn, they will be given hope and counselling, they will be taught job-related skills, self-management and conflict-resolution,' Steve says.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About seven youths will be taken in at a time by referral from benevolent groups, with the standard stay being around four months. `But if someone needs to stay longer, we're flexible. By the same taken, they can leave at any time they like', he said.   </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assessment will be rigorous. The boarders must be prepared to fit in to the community. It's not just somewhere to say. The work will be hard.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Steve says that working the farm and renovating the hospital will give the young people a sense of purpose, a sense of achievement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`People are devalued so often. Here they will be valued, and told they are valuable', he said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A four-bedroom house that also belongs to the property will be used for family respite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`A whole family that needs to get away can come and stay out here, have some quality time together. Maybe mum and the kids need to get away from dad, it can be a safe place.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Steve, his wife Anne, and his four children live in the former male section of the hospital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wards, even a one-time kitchen, have been converted to bedrooms. The lounge area is huge and doubles as an office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`It's like we're just camped here. We've got a lot of work ahead but it's very satisfying work', Steve says.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a fantastic concept. It gives back to its participants the self-respect that they have been robbed of and gives them a real reason for being. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me to my next point&mdash;that of youth suicide. It is centres like the two I have mentioned in northern Tasmania that play a major role in the prevention of youth suicide. They provide an outlet from the pressures which affect many of our youth. Most importantly, they provide hope and a recognition that our young people do not have to face their problems alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Suicide is recognised as one of the major causes of death for those between the ages of 15 and 24, particularly young males. I am very pleased to note that the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council has established a joint Commonwealth-state working group to develop a national policy on child and youth health. Suicide is also one of the priority issues being considered during the development of the mental health goals and targets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be noted, however, that the draft report of the National Health and Medical Research Council's working party, which was released at the Public Health Association's national conference on suicide prevention, commented on the deficiency in suicide data and also called for more research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent report by the Victorian coroner found that suicide was higher in areas of high unemployment but that unemployment was not the direct cause of the rising suicide rate. The study was unable to explain these geographic links and suggested that further research was needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, further research is needed. We, as a government, need to put greater resources into the prevention of suicide as a specific issue; and I, as a member of this government, am working towards that goal. We, as a nation, need to be alerted to and understand better the problems of our youth. And we, as a community, need to foster and support organisations like Youth Unlimited and the Youth Farm to give our youth the support they require. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During last December's Uruguay Round of the GATT, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> splashed out the headline `Australia set for GATT bonanza'. When the big boys of the G7 met in Detroit to discuss their joint unemployment problems, US Treasury Secretary, Lloyd Bentsen, told us the summit would see `jobs and growth move right up to the top of the agenda' for the July G7 summit. Given the economic crisis, it is no wonder they wanted to talk about jobs and growth. But where, we might ask, is the bonanza?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Faith in globalisation, however, has not been confined to the regular suspects. In February this year, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) added his and, I presume, the Left's support for internationalisation when he said that industry policies running counter to internationalisation would probably be ineffective or harmful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Will Hutton in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Guardian Weekly</EMPHASIS> of 20 March offered a more jaundiced view of free trade. The growth of the working poor and the economically inactive, and insecure labour, and what he describes as `an explosive growth not merely of unemployment but of jobs which neither pay a living wage nor survive very long' are what Hutton sees as the major features of the prevailing crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A decent society should link internationalisation to an equitable distribution of wealth in the context of environmental considerations. Unfortunately this is not what internationalisation means. The prophets clamour for micro level reform, including flexible labour markets. Once this is realised, they say, the goodies will flow our way. Will Hutton's interpretation of this as `propaganda masquerading as economics' could not be closer to the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the minds of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), flexible labour markets mean workers without unions; workers on the edge. Workers in Wills, as with workers elsewhere who have lost their jobs or fear for their jobs following deregulation, internationalisation and restructuring of the Australian economy, have a different view of the virtues of flexible labour markets. Unfortunately, in Australia the minions of the market predominate on both sides of the House. It was a Labor government, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you will well remember, which deregulated the financial system, floated our currency and is now in the process of making our labour markets more flexible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should not come as a surprise that the Hawke and Keating governments have been at the helm during a decade when wealth has been distributed obscenely from the bottom rung to the top 10 per cent of income earners. In this context, it is also not surprising that the major thrust of the unemployment green paper, a jobs compact which provides a worthwhile job for the long-term unemployed, is justified in terms of the rhetoric of market efficiency. Only yesterday the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), in response to a dorothy dixer on the G7, was quick to draw a connection between lack of skill and unemployment. There are two major problems with this market approach to unemployment. Firstly, by identifying the worker's lack of skill as the reason for unemployment, the market system gets off scot-free. And, secondly, it opens up the dangerous possibility that workers will be forced to work for the dole, thus ensuring active labour market participation and competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A matter of further concern is the proposal for a training wage for the long-term unemployed. The minister was at pains to convince us that he is not `talking about making available slave labour or cheap labour or anything like that'. The state secretary of the New South Wales TWU, Steve Hutchins, was less than enamoured of the minister's proposal, which he described as `amazing coming from a former president of the ACTU'. I do not know why he thought it was amazing given the former Prime Minister's record. Hutchins's union, he said, `would not be part of any ghetto wage system'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The internationalisation of the market is driving a large part of the Australian labour force out of jobs into insecurity, casualisation and low wages. We have every right to be sceptical of claims that increased employment opportunities in Australia will arise as a consequence of the GATT. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training said as much yesterday. As Humphrey McQueen wryly pointed out in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 12 March, the key players are quick to up the ante whenever one or another country appears to be baulking. It is appropriate that McQueen should attack those who refuse to consider the social costs that result from global corporations controlling national economies. He puts it this way: Australia is supposed to make US$1 billion extra in export returns from improved access to world markets for our agricultural products. This alleged gain has to be balanced against the costs of unemployment after the closure of food plants in our own country towns because of increased processed imports. Most in the National Party of Australia know exactly what McQueen is talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who are still tempted to believe that we are on the verge of a windfall from expanded world trade should consider the assessments of two very sober watchers of the gyrations of global capitalism. Jenny Stewart from the University of Canberra, who is about to publish a significant book on industry policy, had this to say in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 8 December 1993:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The round has degenerated into a series of negotiations between the US, Japan and the European Union . . . If the Europeans are bludgeoned into doing anything about their agricultural trade practices, the chief beneficiary will be the chief bludgeoner, the US.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) during his contribution to the defence debate yesterday painted a less than favourable picture of US foreign policy. Maybe he will lead the charge on US trade policy&mdash;in other words, maybe he will lead the Left in the charge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the March edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quadrant</EMPHASIS>, Colin Teese, a former deputy secretary of the Department of Trade until 1986 and the Australian government representative to GATT from 1972 to 1977, focused on the unemployment consequences. According to Teese, the US trade deficit will only come into balance if 2 1/2 million offshore workers lose their jobs. The view, as expressed by some members of the House during the defence debate yesterday, that the US is both a defender of liberty and a harbinger of good times is just plain stupid. How uplifting it is to see the French film industry defending itself against the US's attempt to acquire cultural hegemony in that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our biggest problem is that, as a consequence of our unilateral tariff and quota reductions, we have got no bargaining chips. Members of the caucus unemployment task force know that a jobs compact looks pretty insipid in the face of globalisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My own electorate of Wills has suffered disproportionately. The members of that caucus committee and I know that it is unlikely that an Australian economic recovery&mdash;or for that matter an international one&mdash;will by itself bring prosperity back to the area. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) not only recognises this problem but has attempted to address it&mdash;hence his recent statement that `the challenge for the government was to tackle the profound effects of structural change on less-well-off groups and areas around Australia'. Unfortunately, the young tyros&mdash;or maybe the tyros from the Right&mdash;are trying to shift him out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without a regional development policy and a comprehensive industry policy, this problem cannot even begin to be resolved.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bronwyn Bishop, by contrast, cannot see the wood for the trees. While Will Hutton argues in favour of `more imagination and urgency if the economic and social divisions that disfigure our society are to be challenged', Mrs Bishop resorts to a series of tired, trite cliches. In the manner of an outdated, old-style footy coach cum charlatan motivator, she exhorts us to believe in ourselves and charge through the brick wall of government regulation. That is absolute rubbish,  and it is astounding to think that she could possibly lead the Liberal Party. A bigger problem than that is the fact that many in the House actually agree with her. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to draw the House's attention today to the conduct of banks in our community and, in particular, to the recent conduct of the Westpac Bank in my electorate. I would like to start by quoting from the review of the recommendations of the recent banking inquiry:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Understanding better the needs of customers is one thing, establishing a sound relationship with them is another. The experiences of the 1980s and the changing nature of the relationship between bank and customer has seen the public perception of banks fall to an historic low. There is an urgent need to restore some of the public trust and confidence which used to exist in banks.</PARA>
<PARA>I would suggest that the Westpac Bank's conduct in the Blue Mountains over recent months certainly has not restored any of that confidence and there is certainly a long way to go before the bank wins back customers in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few months ago Westpac closed its Lawson branch in the mid-mountains. It is a small community, but it has a shopping centre and only one bank. They now have no bank. To get to a bank the shop owners have to travel down a busy highway which takes the main traffic to the west as well as considerable tourist traffic. They have to leave money on their premises overnight, thus increasing security problems. In protest, two of my elderly constituents&mdash;I think they are both in their 70s&mdash;chained themselves to the doors of this bank, to the great embarrassment of the young police officer who had to cut them loose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the bank has decided that it will close its branch at Blackheath, a much bigger community than Lawson. The bank has been in Blackheath for 80 years, and there are people there who have used its services for most of that time. Indeed, there is a Commonwealth Bank there, but people have used the Westpac Bank for all of that time and they do not want to see it go. Clearly, the bank there has no real sense of community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Blue Mountains is made up of a strip of towns and villages covering a considerable area across the mountain range. We do not have a centre as other places do. We cannot close a bank on the periphery and go to the one in the centre. There is no centre of the Blue Mountains. So with the bank branch closing down people have to travel further with no adequate transport. Old people cannot climb station steps to get a train to Katoomba, which is where the nearest branch is. So I suggest that the bank is being very short sighted and is showing a lack of community interest by closing that branch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning I heard that the Blue Mountains City Council, at its meeting last night, resolved that it is to give serious consideration to ceasing its association with Westpac. Currently, the council does all its banking through Westpac. It is calling for tenders for its banking services. From memory, the council has a turnover of about $45 million. At the moment a $1 million loan is due for renewal and the council has decided not to renew it with Westpac. It is seeking offers from other institutions. Westpac will not be invited to tender for that offer. So closing this branch is an extremely short-sighted move on the part of this particular bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are paying for the past mistakes of the Australian banks. The free and easy lending policies of the 1980s are being paid for by ordinary customers, small business people, and ordinary households. They are paying for those mistakes. I came across a glaring example of this in my electorate last week. A small steel fabrication company started three years ago with a staff of four. Its turnover was $70,000. In three years, it has built up to a staff of 22, including three apprentices. That is something that cheers my heart considerably, because hardly anyone is taking on apprentices these days. The fact that this firm is taking on apprentices is to be applauded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This company has small rented premises in an industrial estate in Lawson. The people have to work two shifts, something which unfortunately has been brought to the notice of the council by the neighbours because they do not like steel fabrication work going on at night. The owner has had to put on extra power in order to cope with the work. He said to me, `I think we might be getting towards an unsafe situation'. I am sure none of us wants to see any worker working in an unsafe situation, while at the same time we do want to see companies expanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The owner of this company wants to rent other premises, but he cannot find any. There are no suitable premises in the area. He would like to buy a piece of land in this industrial estate and put up a factory. The whole thing is going to cost him $300,000. Do honourable members think this man can find a bank in the area that will lend him that money? Not on your life! Not one of them will do so&mdash;not Westpac, not the Commonwealth Bank, not the National Bank, not the credit union. They say that he has not got enough money to put in, he has not got enough collateral to start off with, so he has been knocked back. He has asked me for assistance. I will do all I can, and hopefully someone will come to the party and help him out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation is absolutely deplorable. Entrepreneurs of the 1980s only had to lift up the phone&mdash;they did not even have to go into the bank&mdash;to get themselves a loan, and yet this honest, hard-working man is having problems. He has developed his business over the last three years. He is not a greedy person. He is a community spirited person. He personally took some artefacts from a war memorial in the area, refurbished them, polished them, and put them back in time for last year's Anzac Day celebrations, at no cost to the local community. He gives donations to the local community. He works in youth groups and generally supports the local community. Will the banks support him? Not on your life!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to take a long hard look at what is happening with the banks. I applaud Mr Speaker for having chaired the inquiry on banking a few years ago. We have had a review of the inquiry since then. Perhaps we need another review. Perhaps we need to give a few of them another kick up the pants. I would like to conclude by reading some quotes from the original banking inquiry. On quality of service, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Banking is a service industry which must maintain good customer relations by offering good customer service.</PARA>
<PARA>Westpac has not given good customer service to the residents of the Blue Mountains. The report also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Quality of service is much harder to measure than quality of goods.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us think about that. How are we going to measure service? We can measure it easily by the actions of Westpac in the Blue Mountains: there is no service. The section in the report on geographic access is referring to rural areas. The Blue Mountains is a semi-rural area and, because of the travel problems that I have described, access is not easy. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While not a preoccupation for effective competition, physical access to banking services is nonetheless an important one in a country the size of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>I would suggest that, looking at each region one at a time, honourable members will see that access is something that the banks are clearly not addressing; and they are not addressing it in small communities like Lawson and Blackheath, where there are a lot of retired people who do not find it easy to travel long distances to do their banking services. I will end on that note by roundly condemning the Westpac Bank. I think it will find that it is going to suffer, particularly in the Blue Mountains area. </PARA>

On the day after the February unemployment figures were released and the day after the national newspapers and the government were talking about a turnabout in the unemployment situation and talking about the worst being over, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ballarat Courier</EMPHASIS> told a totally different story&mdash;indeed, a story that, I suspect, has been repeated in other regional centres throughout the country. The banner in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ballarat Courier</EMPHASIS> read `Record jobless&mdash;Ballarat total closes on 9,000 barrier'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 9,000 is 9,000 people&mdash;9,000 living and breathing people: not numbers, not statistics, but men, women, mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, grandmothers and grandfathers. I do not want, and they do not want, crocodile tears or false cries of indignation from this government. Rather, we want some action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's sudden interest in regional policies is an obscenely belated, politically-motivated concern for regional rural Australia. It is not motivated by any genuine concern, but rather by retention of power by a dictatorial government presided over by a dictatorial Prime Minister (Mr Keating). In the papers on 11 March we saw such comments as `The recovery has already clearly taken hold in the job market with unemployment rising for the sixth month in a row during February'. That was in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>. In the same paper the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) hailed the growth figures as great news for Australia and for the unemployed in particular. Later on, the minister said that he was confident that the government's election target of half a million jobs in three years would be exceeded and the unemployment rate would be reduced during 1994. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on the same day we saw the banner `Jobs rise confirms jobs growth surge'. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> banner was `The nation goes back to work'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like hell the nation goes back to work! Some parts of it might be, but I can assure this House that in many parts it is not. The ones that are not going back to work are the ones in non-metropolitan Australia, the forgotten Australians, the ones we assume the government believes are the dispensable Australians. They are the ones who live at the end of the bus routes or the end of the tram routes and who have carried the can for this recession, and they are the ones making the major contribution to this country's economy and the ones who are getting nothing from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are hundreds of thousands of Australians who are waiting to see whether the government's action matches its rhetoric, and on past experience there is little to be confident about. I think we should put this into some sort of perspective and look at some of the figures. These are Department of Social Security figures from Ballarat: in February 1994 there were 5,361 in the Ballarat office and in January, 5,142 people. In the Wendouree office, the figure was 3,538 for February, and in January it was 3,434&mdash;respectively, increases of 4.3 and three per cent on the previous month. Let me go back to 1993. In February 1993 the figure for the Ballarat office was 4,771 and in January 1993 it was 4,533; and in the Wendouree office the January figure was 3,053 and the month before, 2,922. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992 the Ballarat office figure was 4,369; the month before it was 4,246. The Wendouree office figure was 2,745 and the month before it was 2,681&mdash;respectively, over two years, a rise of nearly 1,000 people at the Ballarat office and nearly 800 people at the Wendouree office. It is fortunate that the resilience of non-metropolitan Australians is such that they try to solve their own problems. In the Ballarat region, there is a major focus towards developing those things that we are good at and those that we wish to be good at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of the state government's information technology centre will provide a strong fillip for a new growth area in the region. What have we heard from the federal government in relation to this matter? Virtually nothing. Have we had any calls from relevant ministers for their colleagues to give commitments to outsource Commonwealth government information technology into the Ballarat region? Not on your sweet nelly! Have we had an indication from them that they will consider this proposal? Again, nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time left to me there are several matters that I wish to raise. I thank the honourable member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) for the comments she made about banks. I assure her that in the rural sections of my electorate this is a matter of extraordinary concern. It is not just the banks that concern me; it is the withdrawal of services from country Victoria and country Australia back into the regional centres and then the withdrawal of those services back into the major metropolitan services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hear talk about the recession having started in this country in 1988-89. It started a damn long time before that. It started in regional rural Australia, and it went from the smaller centres to the regional centres back into the metropolitan centres. We were first in and you can bet your bottom dollar that we will be the last out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major focus of politics in this country is in metropolitan Melbourne and metropolitan Sydney. I think it is about time that this House as a body&mdash;I am sure members on the other side will agree&mdash;started to respect the wants and aspirations of regional and rural Australians. It has been a long time coming, and it had better start. I am sure there would be a lot of support for that position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a large number of people in this country that suffer a large number of ailments. I do not think there can be one group that suffers more than those who suffer from migraines. This is an extraordinary medical problem. Touch wood, I have never had a migraine, but there are tens of thousands of Australians who suffer from migraine. There is a sort of relief at hand&mdash;and that is a drug called Imigran. The other name for it is Sumatriptan. This drug provides extraordinary relief for migraine sufferers. It is a drug that should be made readily available to those that need it, but it is not available to people at a reasonable price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have urged the government for the last 18 months to do something about this. If there is something in train, the government can accept my apologies. If there is nothing in train, then it needs to apologise to the migraine sufferers in this country. A letter from the Ballarat and District Migraine Support Group states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our first meeting for this year was held on 22nd February and on this occasion several of our members were discussing the use over the holiday period of the new drug Sumatriptan. All who had used it, including myself, had very successful results but agreed it was far too expensive to consider any regular usage. This in turn led to several inquiries as to the progress, if any, of getting this drug on to the National Health List. We all signed a petition that was forwarded on to you early last year and have not heard any feedback on its outcome.</PARA>
<PARA>I wrote to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services (Mr Howe) prior to getting that letter in relation to some other enquiries to see what was happening with it. As yet, I have not had a reply. I hope that is forthcoming very shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have just one more matter. Very briefly, I want to refer back to the sports rorts incident and to pose again the question&mdash;I am not talking about whiteboards; that is passe; let us get back to the absolute heart of this matter&mdash;that has still not been answered by the now disgraced former minister or by anyone else for that matter: what was the rationale for the decisions of this government when it was allocating funds? I will read out the names of some organisations that would very much like to know why there were applications that were granted in category 3&mdash;that is the lowest of all of them&mdash;instead of those in category 2. The Ballarat and District Lapidary Club would like to know; the Avoca Tennis Club would like to know; the shire of Ballan, for the construction of its community leisure centre, would like to know; the Natte Yallock Recreation Reserve Committee would like to know; the city of Stawell, for the construction of two multipurpose courts at the Stawell leisure complex, would like to know; and the Ballarat Regional Athletic Centre Incorporated would like to know&mdash;that is where one of our great Australians, Steve Moneghetti, is unable now to train because the state of this track is simply not good enough for people of that quality to train on and, indeed, is dangerous for our young people&mdash;the answer. I can go through it. They want to know, I want to know, and there are many&mdash;in fact, about 2,100&mdash;Australian organisations that would like to know why they were not given the funds. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to grieve for the state of the Liberal Party in Queensland and what it stands for. I also rise to dispel the untruths raised in the Queensland Legislative Assembly on 23 February this year by the Liberal state member for Clayfield, Mr Santoro.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the north-eastern suburbs of Brisbane, we have seen a takeover of the Liberal Party by the New Right&mdash;disciples of laissez-faire economics, worshipping at the feet of the H.R. Nicholls Society. At the forefront of this group in the north-eastern suburbs of Brisbane is the state member for Clayfield, Mr Santo Santoro. Mr Santoro has proudly told the Queensland Legislative Assembly that, although he is not a member of the H.R. Nicholls Society, he has asked for a membership form. Of course, the H.R. Nicholls Society is an organisation committed to overturning the arbitration system. Mr Santoro's comments are an affirmation of his commitment to low wages and the abolition of the industrial umpire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Santoro has repeatedly congratulated the Victorian government for its `take a pay cut or face the sack' industrial relations policy. He has assured Queenslanders that a coalition government in Queensland would follow the same path as Jeff Kennett in Victoria. In the Queensland Legislative Assembly Mr Santoro has continuously attacked the provisions of state awards. He has argued that VEAs and individual contracts have `a fundamentally important role to play in the Queensland economy'. Mr Santoro, therefore, is obviously a new right hardliner, the type of person who would like to see a kind of 18th century workplace where there are no minimum award rates and there is no umpire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Brisbane suburbs of Kalinga, Eagle Junction, Wooloowin and Clayfield, we have seen Mr Santoro's style of politics at work. Mr Santoro did the numbers for his dry Right buddy, Alderman Clay, to squash the more moderate sitting Liberal alderman, Carrol Cashman. In doing so, she was disendorsed for the forthcoming council elections. Alderman Cashman was dumped in the waste bin of political history by the number crunching of Mr Santoro. Mr Santoro's vicious use of numbers has alienated a number of people in my electorate. It is no wonder that they feel alienated when their representatives like Mr Santoro push the New Right laissez-faire rubbish that has been espoused by Mr Santoro. It is no surprise, of course, that Mr Santoro is, and was, a vocal supporter of Fightback and a well-known proponent of the GST&mdash;that is, a 15 per cent tax on all the necessities of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To achieve their ends, Mr Santoro and his disciples of the New Right in the north-eastern suburbs of Brisbane will go to any lengths. They will go to the lengths of rolling not only Alderman Cashman in the ward of Kalinga, but also the Leader of the Liberal Party in Queensland, Joan Sheldon. Could this be an example of the New Right's attitude to women in representative positions in politics?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Brisbane are now facing the same breed of New Right politics and hypocrisy that has come from Mr Santoro, in the city council elections. Their mayoral candidate in the city council elections, Alderman Ward, has said that the Liberals in Queensland will be concentrating on putting extra density into residential B areas. It is clear that this is the policy fully supported and formulated by Mr Santoro and his dry Right buddies in the Queensland Liberal Party. There can be no confusion as to what they stand for. Mr Santoro and Mr Ward are what we would call `urban density kings'. It was Alderman Ward and his faction king, Mr Santoro, who gave Brisbane the density problems which are now being so much debated in the Brisbane City Council elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This New Right grouping has tried very hard to convince everyone in Brisbane that density problems in Brisbane are somehow the result of a Labor Party conspiracy, when the fact is that all of the density problems in Brisbane were introduced by Alderman Ward, supported by Mr Santoro, in 1987 when Alderman Ward was the chairman of the development committee of the Brisbane City Council. It is time to have a look at some of the high density policies supported by Mr Santoro and Alderman Ward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1987 town plan brought in by Alderman Ward, supported by Mr Santoro, it was the Liberal Party that introduced no controls over the block splitting of 32 perch blocks into 16 perch titles. It was the Liberal Party that allowed the building of boundary walls five metres high on the boundary. It was the Liberal Party that allowed `six pack' developments right up to the sides of blocks. It was the Liberal Party that allowed no control over the development of three-storey blocks. It was the Liberal Party that showed no concern for the character of development in quiet residential areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very clear that all the urban density problems that currently exist in Brisbane are the result of a town plan introduced by Alderman Ward, supported by Mr Santoro, in 1987. It has nothing at all to do with the density policies of Alderman Soorley, the Mayor of Brisbane. All of this adds up to a consistent pattern of policy approach. The pattern of policy approach from the Liberal Party in Queensland, from its deputy leader Mr Santoro and from Alderman Ward, is that of the New Right&mdash;very simply, to support policies such as Fightback, to support a GST, to oppose very valuable social programs such as Medicare, to propose the abolition of labour market programs and generally to support the redistribution of wealth in our community from average income groups in the community to those at the very top. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This can be seen in the Liberal Party's approach to development in the BCC. The Liberal Party basically gave developers in the Brisbane City Council area open slather to develop any area of the city at any time in any way that the developer decided. It was a policy introduced for their developer mates at the expense of the residents of Brisbane. The policies of the Liberal Party have produced a situation where, without the action of Alderman Soorley, we could have seen the character of Brisbane destroyed forever. Brisbane does indeed have a unique character, symbolised by Queenslander homes and large urban blocks. It is a character which has been threatened by the 1987 development plan supported by Mr Santoro and introduced by Alderman Ward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at members of the Liberal Party in Queensland&mdash;which has the support of people such as Mr Everingham, a former member of this House, and people of the type of Mr Santoro and Mr Ward&mdash;it is a shame to see that they are so out of touch with the electors of Queensland that they could continue to support policies espoused in Fightback, that they could continue to support a GST, that they could continue to support high density policies as symbolised in the 1987 town plan and that they could continue to support things like the abolition of Medicare and of labour market programs. This group of people is so out of the touch with the ordinary community is it any wonder that, at the federal level and at the state party level in Brisbane, it faces leadership problems? Now Mr Santoro is moving against Mrs Sheldon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen in the federal Liberal caucus the instability of recent days. Former Prime Minister Fraser has described the Liberal Party as being a policy vacuum of little worth to the general community, irrelevant and out of touch with the community. Why is it so irrelevant and so out of touch? It is because it spends no time mixing with ordinary people in the community. That is how and why it put forward the policy it did in Fightback. Anyone who could stand up and offer to the Australian people a 15 per cent GST on everything and then wonder when the people of Australia hold their nose at the stench of such a policy is seriously out of touch. Anyone who could then thrash around for something like 12 months wondering what went wrong must be out of touch with the needs and aspirations of ordinary Australians. </PARA>

With 17 kilometres to Thangool and 67 to Monto, Lawgi has no phone for travellers' emergencies or for simple local access, to say nothing of the needs of the people who use that isolated hall.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bonython by-election result contains several lessons. The voters' message was `a plague on both your houses'. An amazingly high 22 per cent did not vote for either of the major parties. The real lessons of the Bonython by-election, however, are to be found in the minor parties' votes. Grey Power, representing the elderly, has campaigned for some years with little result. This time it received a substantial 7.3 per cent of the vote&mdash;a superficially surprising result given its minimal campaign and narrow appeal. Yet for some hundreds of thousands of older Australians suffering the chaos and unfairness of the government's constant reduction of their pensions, the unfairness of counting capital gain as income and threats to superannuation, the result was understandable.

It is an organisation which is frequently unrecognised in terms of the value of the work it does in assisting parents, but this value has been recently recognised in that the government has supported the Nursing Mothers Association of Australia with a grant to the tune of $20,000.

<PARA>As far as the Leader of the Opposition is concerned, that is considering each tax proposition on its merits. What the opposition treasury spokesman had to say about cuts was totally erroneous. Firstly, there were cuts in the last budget opposed by the opposition.

However, there are a number of measures which the government has already taken, some of which reflect election commitments and some of which were budget announcements from last year, which will benefit unemployed people in very significant ways by helping them to improve their living standards and also improving the incentives for them to participate in paid work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing I will refer to is the introduction of an earnings credit scheme. The effect of this is that unemployed people will be able to earn more money from part-time and casual work while continuing to receive unemployment payments. They will be able to get a credit of $90 every fortnight if they are single or $80 for each partner of a couple, which will count against their earnings in that fortnight; that is to say unused free area. That can be accumulated up to a total of $500, which they can access so that the earnings they make while they are on unemployment payments up to the value of their credit do not affect their allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another election commitment that the government is giving effect to from this week is the mature age allowance. This is a new payment available for people who have been out of work for 12 months or more over the age of 60. It reflects the reality of the labour market. Many people under current circumstances, while we are still coming out of the recession, find significant difficulty in obtaining work. It is considered a reasonable measure, in effect, to free those people up from the usual requirements and tests that apply to people receiving unemployment payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should stress to honourable members that that is not envisaged by the government as a permanent de facto reduction in the pensionable age. We are committed to maintaining the basic pensionable age of 65 and also gradually moving to that pensionable age for women over time. However, when we have to face the sorts of labour market circumstances that we do now, it is considered appropriate to recognise that and, as an ameliorative measure, to have this mature age allowance which has a sunset date. The matter will be reviewed at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other significant measure is the $3 a week real increase&mdash;that is to say over and above indexation&mdash;in unemployment payments. There will be better access for unemployed people to education and training, with allowees able to do CES approved training and education for up to six months without having to transfer to Austudy or Abstudy. A number of improvements will apply to early identification and assessment of clients with labour market difficulties. There will be a move to case management approaches, which is a demonstrably better way to service the long-term unemployed, in particular, and to improve their work prospects. There will be a further review of compliance measures and some significant improvements in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So all in all, these measures represent a significant package of steps that the government is taking. Most of these measures will come into effect this week. They will significantly improve the prospects of those people and provide some improvement in their overall living standard. We are taking these measures well in advance of the major proposals that are being considered in the context of the government's white paper on employment.</PARA>

I think it is perfectly relevant to make some reference to what the coalition would do for unemployed people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the specific matter of the Telecom card, this is the first time that any government has considered this sort of transitional assistance when there has been an increase in the charges for public phone calls. The last increase in these charges was made in 1986. There has never been any compensation provided for people in these circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we are looking at this issue we have to bear in mind that the whole array of costs borne by pensioners is ultimately reflected in the regular adjustment of pensions in line with the CPI. There is an argument as to whether the CPI is the appropriate measure of the costs of low income people. There are some items which we could say are overrepresented or underrepresented in the basket of goods consumed by low income people compared with others. But, on balance, the CPI has been assessed and found to be a broadly appropriate measure. So in a sense this transitional measure represents a measure over and above the normal adjustment that would flow through via indexation in any case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the broader issue of permanent telephone access and there are some significant barriers to that. My department and I are having some discussions with the communications portfolio to see what steps can be taken to improve access by low income people to telephones generally, not just to public telephones. That is a broader issue. It is an important one and we have it under consideration. Again, I come back to the basic point: for the coalition to be raising the issue of what we are doing for unemployed people and professing to be concerned about the situation of unemployed people and low income earners generally is pure hypocrisy of the worst kind.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LG4">Mr LAVARCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The law as it currently stands allows grandparents to be parties to actions before the Family Court regarding access and custody of children. Obviously, from time to time grandparents avail themselves of their rights. However, the law as it currently stands makes no express reference to the rights of children to have ongoing contact with members of their extended family. That is an issue which the government is looking at in terms of the broader review of the Family Law Act which is under way at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the government delivered its response to the parliamentary committee which looked into the Family Law Act and the Family Court, on the issue of access and custody we expressed a view broadly supporting the reforms which have been embodied in the United Kingdom that have done away with  the terminology of custody and access. However, given that there was not sufficient material on this matter in Australia, I asked the Family Law Council to specifically look at the issue, which it has now done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last couple of days I have been handed its report, which is supportive of Australia going down the same path as now applies in the United Kingdom. As part of that, there will be a much greater emphasis on the processes of mediation as a mechanism to resolve family disputes. Indeed, as part of the report, which will become available to the public shortly, shows, the honourable member will see that when Marriage Guidance Australia, for instance, conducts its mediation in disputes revolving around children it specifically includes in the development of parenting plans a reference to ongoing conduct of children with extended family members and particularly makes reference to grandparents. So I believe that the concerns which the honourable member expressed are legitimate ones.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the law recognises the ability of grandparents to make applications now, it is an area which could be reformed to express a child's right to have continuing contact with extended family members, particularly in terms of the development of parenting plans which is strongly supported by the Family Law Council, and I think it will be looked upon favourably by the government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">China, of course, has made spectacular economic progress in recent years, but it still remains the case that it has low GNP per capita and very substantial poverty, especially in rural areas and the inland provinces. In the coastal provinces, there are very many opportunities, of the kind to which the honourable member refers, for Australia to be involved in developing infrastructure, including the provision of basic urban services, power and transport facilities, and, importantly, in environmental protection and training, an area in which this country has very considerable comparative advantages. In the poorer areas inland, Australia can make a valuable contribution to overcome development constraints in areas such as agriculture, health and community services. The aid program is an important way in which we can expand our relationships with China, both at the political level and in the trading field.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our development cooperation program with China is the third largest we have, after those with Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. We spend around $80m in China, and a major part of that is the concessional finance facility of around $48 million&mdash;DIFF, as it is known elsewhere. The program provides an opportunity for technologically advanced Australian firms to be actively involved in China's development process. The experience that these firms have gained through the aid program has played a key role in facilitating future contracts. Indeed, a recent review of our development assistance programs with China estimated that for every $100 we spent on aid to China the return to Australia was around $300 both in terms of direct procurement and follow-on contracts which came about as a result of our having shown how technologically advanced we are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will outline some examples of bilateral projects with major science and technology components. The institutional links program undertakes collaborative research projects at a number of Chinese universities. There is a mine waste management project which includes an element for mine rehabilitation research. The Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, ACIAR, is currently supporting 18 agricultural research projects with a total value of nearly $10 million in China and is exploring with Madam Deng's agency an extension of activities in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that Australia's aid program does a great deal to showcase Australian technology for export. Australian companies which have this kind of special technological expertise should not overlook the aid program as a key vehicle for promoting their long term commercial interests in China through sectors such as health, education and community services.</PARA>

I ask the minister to also explain, again perhaps without raving, why a woman who cares for her own two children receives a maximum of around $30 a week, subject to a means test under the government's new scheme, while, if the same woman went to work, the government, by virtue of the child-care rebate, would subsidise her $61 a week, which is not means tested, to pay someone else to care for her children? How does the government justify this continued discrimination against parents who make the decision to stay at home to care for their own young children?</PARA></TALK.START>

The honourable member for McPherson said that the increase in the home child-care allowance is over and above the with child rate of DSR. That is not the only relevant consideration. Another facet of it, which is very important, is that some 55,000 low income families whose incomes are not sufficiently great for them to be able to benefit fully from a tax rebate in the form of the dependent spouse rebate will gain a benefit of up to $30 a week as a consequence of the introduction of the home child-care allowance. Some 800,000 or so families get a real increase. Some 55,000 low income families get a benefit of up to $30 a week because their incomes are so low that they could not benefit fully from the tax rebate&mdash;the dependent spouse rebate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another 120,000 families will benefit from the fact that the home child-care allowance is based on a current income test, rather than an annual test through the tax system. That means that women, in the main, will be able to move in and out of the work force and reclaim the benefit within the year, rather than have to wait until the end of the year in order to gain the benefit. So 120,000 or so families will derive a significant benefit in that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another key facet of the scheme is the fact that the payment is being made directly to the carer. That is a very beneficial and significant change. The analogy with child-care is ridiculous. What we are basically saying is that child-care is a work related expense and the compensation that is being provided through the child-care rebate only covers a fraction of the cost of that. So it is not analogous in any way, shape or form to the home child-care allowance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is now a clear recommendation by a Commonwealth authority on the correct labelling for triglycidylisocyanurate, which means better information and safety for workers who are handling that chemical. The background to this was that Ciba-Geigy had disputed the director's recommendation on the chemical that it be labelled toxic and may cause heritable genetic damage. So it is a very serious chemical. It is a very serious case as the chemical is widely used in Australia as a powder coating on metal finishings, such as metal furniture, car parts and electrical appliances. So it is important that we have clarification as to how this particular chemical would be labelled, and therefore used, for the safety of Australian workers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my mind, the decision by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal endorses the integrity of the Commonwealth's industrial chemicals notification and assessment scheme. Further to that, the assessment report is the first comprehensive assessment in the world of the toxicology of, and exposure to, TGIC. So it will be most important worldwide how this chemical, which is widely used in the metal finishing industry, is handled by Australian and other workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also raises concerns about the potential for the chemical to cause cancer and to adversely affect reproduction. It has been recommended that further testing be done to investigate those questions. This confirmation by the AAT tells us that our national industrial chemicals notification and assessment scheme has great integrity. It has worked in this case. I am disappointed that Ciba-Geigy held up the assessment for 10 months. For 10 months it disputed that such a chemical should be labelled toxic and may cause heritable genetic damage. So for 10 months people were either unknowing or unsure as to the toxicity of that chemical. That is a grave pity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that these chemicals are dangerous. We have means by which they can be handled safely. Our system works, and I advise all chemicals companies to treat our system well and advisedly. Our major aim is to protect Australian workers and their occupational health and safety.

Indeed, even the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) in his interjection yesterday said that I had a question on notice to him as foreign minister for six years and he did not answer it.

He has sought to introduce an allegation&mdash;we are as pleased as anyone else to have it checked out&mdash;and on the basis of that one allegation suggested that the Commonwealth government does the bidding only of the trade union movement. That is absolutely incorrect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no knowledge whatsoever of Watts, McCartney and Delohery. Let me make that quite clear. I have no information whatsoever as to the relationship between those employed by Australia Post and those employed by the Communication Workers Union. On the basis of that one allegation, he seeks to broaden the gamut and suggest that we simply do the bidding of the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me suggest this to him: he talks about the return to the dark days as if somehow we produced them in industrial relations, as if somehow we produced the sort of mayhem that was caused in the 1980s in industrial relations. As was mentioned today in question time, one measure of a good deal in industrial relations is the number of strikes or the number of working days lost. Surely that is the measure of good industrial relations. If the Commonwealth were to be doing the bidding of the unions in getting down the number of working days lost, I would not care. If we have few industrial disputes, that is good for business, and I thought that is what those people opposite were about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of working days lost per thousand employees in 1993 was the lowest recorded since 1933&mdash;the lowest reported in 60 years. The number of disputes last year was the lowest since 1942. With that level of objective evidence, there can be no suggestion whatsoever that the relationship between the Commonwealth and the trade union movement is such as to damage the Australian economic fabric. So what is the point that the honourable member makes? I cannot help on that. Beyond the allegation, his arguments fall flat. There is nothing he has to say to us or to the Australian community about industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give him some other evidence. He mentioned that millions of dollars were spent on the trade union movement for its purposes. He was probably referring to programs like the workplace reform program. In that initiative we spent money with the trade union movement and employers in order to get greater productivity, greater efficiency, improved industrial relations and to make more effective use of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give some figures to show how the millions of dollars are spent in that program. These are the programs that make enterprises and businesses more effective, efficient and profitable as well as give people better working lives. We do not siphon it off to the trade union movement. Quite openly and publicly, we have indicated the sorts of assistance we will give to the trade unions and the employers. In the workplace reform program, at the national level the grants approved in 1992-93 to employers totalled $645,000. Our friends, the trade union movement, received only $113,000. So it is patent nonsense to suggest, by inference in this case, that we have used Commonwealth money&mdash;that is, taxpayers' money&mdash;to assist the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Beyond the allegations, it is clear from the published evidence that we have given most of the money in this program to the employers&mdash;despite the fact that it takes two to tango. There is no way we can get more productive workplaces in this country and better industrial relations until both parties to the agreement dance to the same tune. In this case, workplace reform program grants, which are our major vehicle for improving industrial relations, gave $600,000 to the employers but just over $100,000 to the unions. The 1993-94 figures indicate a similar balance. For some reason, I have got only state figures. In Victoria, $134,000 was spent on the unions and $193,000 on the employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that we sought constantly to invoke the  goodwill of both employers and unions to ensure we had better and more productive workplace relations. The runs are on the board for productivity and output and for the low level of dispute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me come to that other furphy that somehow a list now exists on the waterfront to give preference in employment. That is not so. I have introduced a bill&mdash;that is what this is all about&mdash;which concerns levying the stevedores in order that they repay the loans they made to make redundancy payments for waterside workers. Over 5,000 waterside workers have left the waterside in the last two years. I think that is over 57 per cent of the waterfront. Out of that comes a stream of productivity improvements which I will be able to read to the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, specifically in the bill, the register of waterside workers for the purposes related to levy collection will be removed. The list as we know it, which in the old days was used for preference in employment, will not exist. The list, to the extent that it was used to raise a levy to pay back the amount of money that the stevedores borrowed to pay people out, does not exist. There will be a new list of those employed simply because it is a convention within the International Labor Organisation that some list should be in existence. It will not determine preference of employment. Both the Maritime Union of Australia and the stevedoring employees know that. I think what you are confusing here&mdash;I give you the benefit of saying that you are confused; I think you are deliberately misreading the situation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Rocher)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;I think it would facilitate the proceedings if you addressed your remarks through the chair. I think it will not attract flies and interjections. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JH4">Mr JOHNS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over a decade ago and more, waterside workers were employed on a day-to-day basis and in those days a list was kept. If the only security of employment people had was to have some preference when they turned up at 5 o'clock in the morning to work and be paid that day&mdash;some of my brothers and my father have worked under these conditions&mdash;I suppose to have a list of preference was not a bad idea. No-one works on the waterside in that manner now. These people are permanently employed. We have taken them from an industry basis of employment, as existed in the old days, to an enterprise basis of employment, as is true of nearly every other worker.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So keep this in mind: we now have permanently employed people and we have far fewer permanently employed people on the waterside than was once the case. There will also be a list kept of those now employed, but it will not state that those people are to be given preference in employment because they are employed on a permanent basis. We have achieved that with the trade union movement. It always sought a situation of permanent employment and no-one ever wanted to run under the old system of day labour when it was not a bad idea to have a list for preference in employment. So the list raised by the honourable member for Bennelong was a furphy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sort of productivity that we have been able to get out of the waterfront as a result of these changes will come as good news to the Australian economy. There has been a 57 per cent reduction in the work force while handling similar levels of cargo in the peak period of 1989; Australian grain ports are now amongst the most efficient in the world; containers handled per person per shift have increased by 127 per cent; ship turnaround time has been reduced by around 45 per cent; and containers handled per gross crane hour at container terminals have increased by 57 per cent. It is estimated that the recurrent annual savings from reduced work force size and faster turnaround of container ships are at least $300 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is some pay-off for having a good relationship with the trade union movement! That is hardly having the trade union movement pulling the strings of the Commonwealth government. There are runs on the board: productivity gains and dollars earned as a result of a mature relationship between the Commonwealth and the trade union movement. So it is a nonsense to suggest that a list exists on the wharf for the purposes of preferential treatment; it is a nonsense to suggest that the changes we have made on the wharf have not produced some marvellous improvements in productivity; and it is a nonsense to suggest that somehow the very close and proper relationship between the Commonwealth and the trade union movement is soured across all fronts as a result of one allegation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make it also clear&mdash;this is something that those opposite will never ever be able to undo, should they ever come to power&mdash;that in almost every meeting in every department or under every program throughout the Commonwealth now, there are tripartite agreements or tripartite councils. That is, the trade union movement, employers and the government meet together to nut out agreements in all sorts of areas throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth. That is maturity and, what is more, it has become a culture. It is the way we now govern. We should have the major social partners in the Australian economy, employers and employees, sitting down not just to debate an industrial relations matter. We have broadened the gamut. The ACTU helped us to broaden that gamut because it suggested that there is more to life than a simple bargain or a simple wage rate&mdash;and there is more to life than that. Workers want more than a particular number of dollars in their pay packets at the end of the week, fortnight or month. They want to know that there are other ways in which they can be protected, saved or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about those protections? The honourable member for Bennelong has said, endlessly now for some months, that the new Industrial Relations Reform Act will not only give all protections to employees&mdash;and there is nothing wrong with that&mdash;but also that somehow it was written at the express behest of the ACTU and every dot, full stop, crossed `t', the lot, was written by it. That is not true. Honourable members will remember very clearly that the trade unions wanted, for instance, under what we call the new enterprise flexibility agreements, a situation where they could veto an agreement which was essentially between non-union workers and an employer. Now that is not the case. Honourable members should read the act. The act says that, in negotiations or in the writing of an agreement between a non-unionised or a predominantly non-unionised workshop and a boss or employer, a relevant union should be notified, but it has no veto. I remember that that was a pretty tough old debate between the Commonwealth government and the trade union movement. But it was our view that the trade union movement should not have a veto over those sorts of agreements&mdash;and the act says that it shall not have a veto over those sorts of agreements. So we are hardly doing the bidding of the trade union movement in that particular instance which relates to a very large section of the new Industrial Relations Reform Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does give the opportunity to the trade union movement to go out and seek new work, to do what it has learned best over 70 years or so of operation&mdash;and that is to become good advocates for workers before the Industrial Relations Commission or to represent, directly to employers, the needs and wants of the employed work force. The trade union movement is an expert at that, so why should it not buy into this whole new stream of enterprise flexibility agreements so as to allow that expertise to be used? But it is not compulsory. People do not have to call the union in, but if they are bright they will. If they want some good advocates, they should call up their union. If they are employed under an award and are not in a union, they should get in touch with the Commonwealth or its equivalent, the state department of industrial relations, find out which union covers that award and come in and ask it for assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the honourable member for Bennelong has suggested that one allegation he has raised somehow sullies us or proves the point that he puts forward&mdash;that we work and operate only at the behest of the trade union movement. I have now suggested that is a nonsense and have done so categorically. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased that the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Johns) has decided to take up the allegations that were made by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) earlier today in his address on this matter of public importance. In the process of the assistant minister taking up those allegations and investigating them, I hope that he will find out, for the benefit of honourable members of this House and for the people of Australia, and in particular the taxpayers of Australia, how much and for how long these people are being paid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very important issue that the opposition raises today because the relationship between the trade union movement of Australia and the Australian Labor Party is such that they are one and the same; the two bodies are intertwined. We all know, as the honourable member for Bennelong pointed out in his address, that there are substantial taxpayers' funds being directed by this government to the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the assistant minister is checking out the points raised by the honourable member for Bennelong, he might also like to try to find out how much of that $15 million, given to the trade union movement by this government over recent times, has trickled back to the Australian Labor Party in the form of donations from those trade unions. I think we would all be interested to find that out. I am sure that it would amount to a lot of money&mdash;taxpayers' money being redirected to the Labor Party via the trade union movement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And, of course, as has been pointed out to me, the resources, paid for by the taxpayer and lent to the Labor Party during election time, are considerable. The opposition, by raising this matter today in the parliament, is trying to draw to the attention of the people of Australia this very close and incestuous relationship between the Australian Labor Party and the trade union movement of Australia. This is of great concern to us. If we look right throughout the industrial landscape today, we will see how that incestuous relationship works&mdash;not to the benefit of ordinary Australians, not to the benefit of those people who have not got a job, but to the benefit of trade unions and their members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no greater example of that incestuous relationship working for the benefit of a privileged few than that which we have seen on the Australian waterfront over the last few years. Whilst the assistant minister is checking out his facts, he might also like to take some time to study the history and nature of the Australian waterfront. From what he has been saying to the House this afternoon, he obviously does not understand it. In particular, he obviously does not understand the consequence of the legislation that he himself has brought before this House&mdash;legislation which has been highlighted in recent days by both the honourable member for Bennelong and me and which appals every one of the stevedores in Australia today. They, unlike the assistant minister, understand the consequences of what this government is trying to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last few years, we have seen the government authorise the payment of $450 million&mdash;half of it taxpayers' money and the other half raised by a levy imposed not on the stevedores, as the minister was trying to point out, but indeed on the users of the waterfront, the exporters and importers&mdash;to those 4,000-odd wharfies who have taken redundancy packages. That money was paid out to people who were formerly wharfies to get them to retire. It was paid out on the basis that the union would agree to a number of work practice reforms at the waterfront. The union agreed to those changes and the principal change, of course, was that the industry would go from being an industry wide based organisation, where basically everybody worked for nobody, with employers having to take people out of a pool, to being one that was focused on an enterprise. So Conaust employed people who worked solely for Conaust, or Australian Stevedores employed people who worked solely for Australian Stevedores. This was a good step forward, a step forward that the stevedores were prepared to take, on the basis that the union agreed to it and stood by it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government, of course, is going in the exact opposite direction of that. But, of course, the union took the $450 million. It negotiated a 23 per cent pay rise for those who continued to work on the waterfront after the reform program had finished, leaving those people who worked on the waterfront with take-home pay in excess of $90,000 per annum for a work week that most of us here in this place would complete before Tuesday afternoon. Those are the deals that were struck: a 23 per cent pay rise and a $450 million payout to former wharfies to get them to retire, on the basis that the government stuck to its guns and the union stuck to the agreement that it had made with the employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we see now is a complete reversal of that. Under the legislation that the assistant minister introduced into this House, the government is re-establishing a register. It is a register not just of permanent employees, as the assistant minister tried to indicate in his speech. He must understand that it is a register of all people who work on the waterfront, whether they are permanent or casual workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people who work on the Australian waterfront in big ports, little ports and medium-sized ports are casual workers. The whole purpose behind the re-establishment of the register is to ensure that the trade unions know precisely who is working at what port, for how long and for whom. This gives them more control. The assistant minister said, `We are not doing this to try to give wharfies some form of preference; we are doing it to complete our obligations under International Labour Organisation convention 137. Article 3, point 2 of ILO convention 137 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Registered dockworkers shall have priority of engagement for dock work.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the convention that the assistant minister is introducing into this House as a result of the government's legislation. That is the exact opposite of what the assistant minister said in his speech today and, indeed, it is the exact opposite of what the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) has been saying. We are seeing a gradual erosion of the benefits that the employers of wharf labourers achieved out of the waterfront reform process&mdash;a process which saw all of that $450 million go to the wharfies and which saw those who remain get a 23 per cent pay rise. We are seeing the erosion of productivity gains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly enough, during the waterfront reform process there was an increase in productivity from a very low base&mdash;from 12 containers or TEUs per hour, in some cases, up to 18 TEUs per hour. That is a 50 per cent increase, which we heard the minister tout during his speech earlier today. Let me tell the minister that now that the unions have got the money&mdash;the $450 million&mdash;and the workers who remain have their 23 per cent pay rise, those productivity levels have dropped back. For example, the Port of Sydney has gone from 19 TEUs per hour to 14 TEUs per hour; the Port of Melbourne has gone from 27 TEUs per hour to 19 TEUs per hour. Is that the sort of productivity increase we should be proud of? Is that the sort of productivity increase we should expect from a $450 million payout&mdash;half of which is from the taxpayers, with the rest being paid by the consumers of Australia? No, it is not. What we see with that example and with the example of the legislation that this minister has introduced into this House is an attempt to grab back all of the good things that our waterside workers used to enjoy before the waterfront reform process was enacted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we think that the sports rorts affair which dealt with the allocation of $30 million of taxpayers funds was a scandal, the $450 million which has been paid out to retiring wharfies is the scandal of this century. We have never seen such a greater misuse of taxpayers' funds for so little gain. It is this point that the opposition is raising because we are concerned that the taxpayers of Australia, through the incestuously close relationship between the trade unions and the Labor Party, are being ripped off unmercilessly. The beneficiaries are not ordinary Australians or people seeking a job; it is those who are members of unions like the former Waterside Workers Federation, now the Maritime Union of Australia. They are the ones who are harming Australia, in cohorts with their partners&mdash;the ALP in government here. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was a solicitor in a previous life. I sincerely hope that when he leaves this place he does not intend to resume practice; if he does I hope that none of his prospective clients were watching his performance this afternoon. Some extremely flimsy evidence and material has been put before the House today to support accusations about a particular matter relating to the Communication Workers Union in Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have an open mind about the matters raised by the honourable member for Bennelong. Certainly I, like the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Johns), do not know any of the specifics. I suggest that it is drawing something of a long bow to suggest that, simply because Senator Richardson has some sort of past connection with this union&mdash;for example, his father&mdash;that therefore means he is in some way directly, beyond his portfolio responsibilities, involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also suggest that the honourable member will need something more than what he has stated to the House today to convince me that the work that these people are engaged in is in fact overwhelmingly or totally work for the union. I am aware of a reverse situation: a union official in the same union who is paid by the union is currently working on Australia Post premises, presumably as a result of enterprise bargaining. Therefore, on the face of it, what the honourable member puts forward will not necessarily be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also suggest to the honourable member, as somebody who has had fairly extensive experience in union election campaigns and who has been involved centrally in some of the most bitterly fought union election campaigns in recent history in this country, that to suggest that having someone on the payroll for 18 months prior to a union election campaign is related to those elections is drawing something of a long bow. The honourable member will need to come forward with some slightly more substantial evidence than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it quite laughable that he stumbled two-thirds of the way through his speech. He had to refer to the student movement. In order to sustain the proposition we have before us&mdash;the continued willingness of the Keating government to bow to the unreasonable demands of the trade union movement&mdash;the honourable member for Bennelong put forward matters relating to voluntary student unionism. He referred to an issue on which, to the best of my knowledge, the trade union movement&mdash;as distinct from the student union movement&mdash;has probably made no submissions whatsoever to the federal government. I suggest to the honourable member that that issue is of relatively low concern and priority to the trade union movement generally, even though I suspect it would be supportive of the view that I take. Therefore, if he can find only an issue of that nature to cite as an example of the trade union movement's supposed hold on the Keating government, he is in desperate trouble in regard to evidence. As I said, if the honourable member is to have prospective clients when he takes his failed career out of this place and goes back to his former occupation, I suggest he will have to fix up his game.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will refer to a couple of the matters that the opposition has raised in other debates on this issue. In light of changes to the industrial relations legislation there has been some hysteria with respect to unfair dismissals. Outrageous suggestions have been made by Mr Catanzariti with respect to companies supposedly being asked to get in first, to sack staff before being subject to any form of due process about whether or not it has been done fairly. The key issue is fairness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been involved in many unfair dismissal cases, particularly in the Victorian state jurisdiction; I also had involvement in the federal jurisdiction. The core issue at all times is: has the employer a legitimate reason&mdash;such as poor performance&mdash;for dismissing the employee, or has it been completely arbitrary, unjust and unfair? If employers operate according to those rules, they have nothing to worry about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Suggestions have been made about the appointment of Mr Iain Ross as the new person in charge of enterprise bargaining. I have had a fair bit to do with Mr Iain Ross. I could say fairly accurately that he is widely respected across the trade union movement and by employers. It is not an easy thing for a senior trade union official in the ACTU to have pretty well universal respect across the trade union movement. It is almost as hard as a Liberal leader having complete respect across his or her own backbenchers. In the trade union movement, with all the internal battles and competition over members and the like, it is extremely difficult for somebody to have that respect; Mr Iain Ross has that respect. He is a very worthwhile appointment to that position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find the suggestion that the trade union movement is in some way controlling the federal government a bit laughable. It was not so long ago that I was a trade union official dealing with the federal government and fighting battles with the federal government. We fought battles over deregulation of the airlines and we lost. We fought battles over the sale of Australian Airlines and Qantas and we lost. We fought battles over things like enterprise bargaining and section 118A of the Industrial Relations Act and demarcation issues, and we lost. There are many instances where the trade union movement and particular unions, such as the one I was involved in, have put positions to the government and lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the latest round of changes to the industrial relations legislation, the trade union movement did not want sections 45D and E of the Trade Practices Act; it did not want any common law torts with respect to industrial action. Did it achieve those objectives? No. So the suggestion that the trade union movement is dominating or controlling the agenda of this government is absolutely, completely unfounded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is really going on is that once again we have the honourable member for Bennelong strutting his stuff as a potential leadership contender. Here we have Lazarus lying on the slab with the old valve spluttering away thinking, `Oh my God, the triple bypass is finally coming&mdash;something I thought was not possible is here'. So he is among the bitter and twisted constituency that the Liberal Party has somewhere out there, which thinks that trade unions are the source of all evil, whipping up the hysteria again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we have `Dame' Bronwyn and her apprentice the mad monk, in the two seats in Sydney where there are by-election campaigns masquerading as the most royalist people that the British empire has ever seen.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will get to the point. It is pertinent that I am now referring to somebody who presents himself as a friend of the workers, who would see himself as somebody seeking a blue-collar constituency. But he has one hand patting them on the back and the other hand in their pocket. That is what the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) is on about. If the honourable member for Higgins is suggesting that the Liberal Party has a potential constituency amongst blue-collar workers and at the same time saying to those low paid workers, `We want to remove the protections from you; we want to allow your employer to exploit you to the maximum extent possible; we want to leave you up to the freedom of the marketplace, the situation where you can bargain on a supposedly equal basis as an individual with your powerful wealthy employer'&mdash;then he is deluding himself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the honourable member for Bennelong is giving his leadership pretensions a run. I was disappointed today; he has been in better form on previous instances. He actually raised few issues that have to be debated. He had to throw in the student movement today in order to fill up his 15 minutes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other factor behind this is the fact that the Liberal Party and the National Party want to lower wages for the lower paid and for the industrially weak. That is the consequence of their policy; that is what they are on about. They suggest that this will create jobs. Yet the United Kingdom, which has an absolutely deregulated labour market as a result of 15 years of Thatcherism, has had its unemployment rate increase under that regime and its rate is certainly no better than ours. In Victoria, which under Labor had a better employment situation than the rest of the nation, we see that since Jeff Kennett has been in office with his new industrial regulation system that state is now getting to the stage where it is challenging Tasmania for the position of having the worst unemployment record in the country. All this has occurred since Mr Kennett introduced his marvellous new legislation, which effectively largely deregulates the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If they were about cutting wages, as the Liberal Party and the National Party are, to create jobs and even if that produced the result that they claim, we would still have a situation where the people in our community who can least afford to pay would be bearing the cost. They oppose taxation, they want to leave the wealthy people not paying their way. They are the parties of the tax avoiders, the rorters. They are the parties who want to see those lower down the scale bear the full cost of fixing unemployment. Their constituency&mdash;what is left of it&mdash;will get away scot free.

<PARA>Albion is a 460-hectare property located about 15 kilometres west of the Melbourne central business district. In December 1985, the then minister for defence announced the closure of the factory following a review of all defence explosives factories which recommended that capabilities be transferred to the factory in Mulwala, New South Wales.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;It is my pleasure to table, on behalf of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, the committee's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Buying our future</EMPHASIS>. This is the first report of the committee's inquiry into Australian government purchasing policies and the promotion of Australian-made goods and services. I use the term `first report' advisedly, since there are many important issues which have emerged during the inquiry which the committee has not had the chance to fully explore. These include the systems immigration panel and the important area of GBE purchasing. The committee will also be keen to follow changes in government purchasing now under way and proposed by the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of serious problems with the way Commonwealth purchasing is carried out. These relate to both the policy and its implementation. A major result of these problems is that the capacity of government purchasing to assist in the development of the Australian economy is largely being squandered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The prime objective of Commonwealth purchasing is to achieve value for money. The central operating principle is stated to be open and effective competition. Those are the topics of the first and second Commonwealth procurement guidelines. The subject of the 12th guideline&mdash;and I emphasise `12th'&mdash;is how to maximise competitive opportunities for Australian and New Zealand suppliers. The ranking of the guidelines would appear to be more than coincidental. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee received a substantial body of evidence that government buyers still usually interpret value for money as meaning buying the cheapest product. That is hardly surprising. Decentralisation and devolution of purchasing responsibility have resulted in an explosion in the number of people involved in purchasing in government departments. Whilst not all are required to undertake whole of life costing, many who should are poorly trained and ill-equipped to carry out a whole of life cost benefit analysis, let alone to evaluate the broader benefits that can flow to the Australian economy from purchasing locally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of barriers for local suppliers were raised in evidence. These include the wording of tender specifications so that overseas suppliers are naturally favoured, the cost of tendering and the complexity of documentation. In many product or service categories, Australian suppliers are small by comparison with their overseas competitors. Factors such as cost or administrative complexity have a disproportionate effect on small firms. The committee has therefore recommended a number of measures to help overcome the problems suffered by small- or medium-sized enterprises in gaining access to government procurement. These include setting aside 10 per cent of government procurement for small to medium sized enterprises and requiring agencies to provide justification where purchases under $10,000 are not made from small- or medium-sized enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overwhelming weight of evidence supports the view that maximising opportunities for Australian and New Zealand suppliers is the least understood and least implemented guideline in the purchasing process. This guideline specifically states that, although the aim is to maximise opportunities for ANZ suppliers, it is not the aim to maximise ANZ content of purchases. The wording encourages a purchasing culture which pays no more than lip-service to maximising economic benefit to Australia. Personally, I find the sentiments conveyed by this part of the guideline to be not just ill-conceived and misplaced; as a member of our national parliament I find it offensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was surprised to find that little information was available on the investment and employment multipliers associated with increasing local procurement. Calculation of the benefits to the Australian economy from making greater use of Australian suppliers has been seen by government agencies as too difficult or more difficult than calculating the costs. It has therefore not been attempted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The positive contributions of Telecom and various defence projects have clearly demonstrated that government purchasing can play an important role in industry development. The size of the annual procurement budget&mdash;some $8 billion to $12 billion per annum&mdash;indicates the potential that exists to benefit the economy through employment generation and import substitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The available evidence also indicates that most other developed nations extract considerable leverage from government procurement. The committee has therefore recommended that the guidelines should be rewritten to require purchasing officers to maximise the level of competitive ANZ content of purchases, rather than just maximising opportunities. That is, we want to do something about outcomes. We want to see more ANZ firms cross the finish line. We do not just want them to satisfied, as they are at present, simply because they have got to the starting blocks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development of a purchasing culture which automatically looks to justify why ANZ goods and services are not being purchased is crucial to obtaining maximum benefits for Australia. Other countries have such an attitude. We have recommended that industry development commitments be included in the criteria for assessing tenders. Importantly, we have also recommended that commitments of the successful tenderer be included as enforceable clauses in the contract. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The partnership for development and fixed term agreement programs would be accommodated within a wider approved supplier scheme. This will ensure that there is substance in the undertakings given. It will also ensure that the promise of industry development, employment generation and gains for the balance of payments are more likely to be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next major group of problems includes those which flow from the devolution and decentralisation of purchasing responsibility. Basically, it is a question of too many buyers who are too poorly trained and who are without adequate monitoring and accountability. Decentralisation and devolution have resulted in an explosion in the number of people involved in purchasing in Commonwealth agencies. The number has increased from approximately 3,500 full time and 10,000 part time before the 1989 reforms to an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 full time and part time in 1993. Many are inadequately trained. Given the numbers involved, they are never likely to be adequately trained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee encountered problems caused by the lack of purchasing statistics when attempting to determine the level of local content in government purchasing. Purchasing Australia, within the Department of Administrative Services, informed the committee that no statistics are kept concerning the level of Commonwealth purchases from ANZ suppliers. The absence of that data clearly indicates that there has been no serious attempt to evaluate the extent to which key aspects of that 12th guideline have been implemented. Nothing could better illustrate the low priority given to the objective of maximising opportunities for ANZ suppliers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lack of data on government purchasing is not a new issue. A number of committees of inquiry into government purchasing have pointed to the lack of data as a major impediment to their investigations of purchasing activity. The committee does not consider that all purchasing should be recentralised within agencies. Low value purchasing can be done more efficiently by purchasing officers at a more devolved level. However, purchasing above a threshold limit should be conducted by trained purchasing staff in a central purchasing unit within agencies, and we have recommended accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems we identified in relation to the purchasing system as a whole were reflected in our investigations of the Australian government credit card system. Our concerns about the credit card system were confirmed by the efficiency audit released late last year by the Australian National Audit Office. The committee sought detailed information from all departments concerning the Australian government credit cards issued to their officers. Some of the information provided to the committee from departments was either inaccurate or lacking in detail. For example, the audit office informed the committee that the information we had received from departments about credit limits on individual cards was not correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original intention of the Australian government credit card system was that it should be used primarily for paying minor claims. In practice, most of the expenditure on the card was made up of transactions larger than $1,000. Indeed, some cardholders have limits of $2 million per month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are approximately 16,000 credit cards on issue. The audit office estimated that only 35 per cent of these cardholders have received any training on how the cards should be used, yet directions from the Department of Finance strongly encourage the use of the cards. The audit office report found, however, that the card is considerably more expensive to the Commonwealth than many other possible methods of payment. The committee has made a number of recommendations concerning a reduction in the number of cards issued, a reduction in maximum monthly credit limits so that the card will be used only for small purchases and the need for proper training of credit card users and those responsible for monitoring their use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The magnitude of the deficiencies identified in the failure of the present system to prevent or remedy them leads the committee to recommend a major institutional change in the administration of purchasing policy. There is a culture within the bureaucracy and a sentiment within current policy which both need major alteration. The creation of a new national procurement board is important in bringing about that change in attitude and policy focus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current administrative arrangements are not capable of delivering the attitudinal changes, efficiencies and industry development benefits which are desirable. A high level group with public, private sector and union participation needs to be created to advise the government on implementation and operation of changes to the purchasing system. The committee therefore recommends the establishment of a national procurement board with appropriate membership, responsibilities and resources to address these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Electronic commerce by Commonwealth agencies has potential benefits for both suppliers and buyers. Where it has been introduced, electronic commerce has been estimated to save between five per cent and 10 per cent of outlays. Potential savings to the Commonwealth are therefore in the hundreds of millions of dollars per year. The committee has recommended that the government implement whole of government electronic commerce by December 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recommends that the common use contract system should be subsumed within a wider approved supplier list. An approved supplier list would consist of suppliers that have undergone some form of prequalification, the criteria for which would include value for money, quality and, just as importantly, industry commitment. Purchasing from approved suppliers should be mandatory. Under current purchasing policy, buyers are required to purchase through the common use contracts, but it is widely acknowledged that the policy is not being followed. The mandatory requirement should be incorporated in the finance regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point I place on record my appreciation&mdash;I am sure I speak on behalf of all members of the committee&mdash;of the hard work of the secretariat during the 10 months of this inquiry. The work of Paul McMahon, the secretary, Richard Cavanagh, in the secretariat, and others, particularly those who we were fortunate to have seconded from DITARD and DAS to assist us in the preparation of this report, provided invaluable assistance without which we would not have been in a position to table this report at this time. I thank them for the high quality of their work, their diligence and their consideration for committee members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report is the result of a considerable amount of investigation and thought. Indeed, many of the chapters could easily have become full reports in their own right. There are major problems in the present purchasing policy and practice. Decentralisation and devolution of responsibility for purchasing have meant that proper monitoring and accountability have been neglected. The potential of government purchasing power to benefit the Australian economy has been lost. The committee does not have confidence in the capacity of the present administrative structure to address those problems. We have made some 45 recommendations which, if adopted by the government, will help develop a procurement system with coordinated national goals, supporting competitive ANZ industry, implemented effectively and efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the report to the House and place on record my thanks to fellow members of the committee. It has been a pleasure and a privilege to chair the committee over the 10 months or so of this inquiry. The support from committee members has been strong and the strength of that support is evidenced in the high quality of the report before the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Buy Australian should be the motto and No. 1 priority of the purchasing policies of Australian government departments. There is a very real need to change the culture and thinking of government agencies and they should be setting the lead in Australia. As the deputy chairman of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, I support the remarks made by the chairman, the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), on the tabling of the report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian government purchasing policies: Buying our future</EMPHASIS>. I congratulate him and the staff of that committee for their dedication to the task. I also thank my own colleagues for the dedication they showed to what has been a very exhaustive inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is most important that Australian content should be absolutely paramount in Australian government purchasing policies. It is from there, the committee found, that industry in this country could be enhanced. I give an example of just how deep seated the problem is, even in things we take for granted in this House. One of the first tasks when we are elected to this House as new members is to be sworn in. I have with me a very treasured article&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Holy Bible</EMPHASIS> I was presented with when I was sworn in on 8 May 1990. I find, to my disgust, that the bible was made and printed in the Republic of Korea. There are many fine printers in Australia who could produce a bible of this quality. Maryborough in central Victoria is the heart of the printing industry and I am sure printers there would be very capable of producing this. A way of enhancing Australian industry and enhancing Australian production is to open up the purchasing policies of the Australian government departments by giving greater consideration to Australian manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee took evidence from Telecom during the inquiry. Telecom has a policy of positive discrimination towards Australian manufacturers. As a result, it has developed some very good initiatives and some very fine products&mdash;products which not only fulfilled and satisfied the Australian market but also created and led to exports from this country to overseas markets. This is the type of culture and thinking that we want to encourage as a result of the tabling of this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is, as the chairman quite correctly said, a first report, as it will be necessary, I believe, to monitor what government departments are doing in the future to ensure that they are giving full consideration to Australian manufacturers and the development of Australian product so that the recommendations of this committee are enacted by the government and so that we ensure that Australian government departments continue to consider this on an ongoing basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to enhance industry development in this country. I mentioned the range of products of Telecom. The evidence we received from Telecom was amongst the most convincing and certainly the most valuable, particularly when it introduced us to its electronic commerce system. That was particularly good. It opens up the opportunity for the introduction of electronic commerce into the purchasing arrangements of Australian government departments. The electronic commerce system, if adopted by government, not only will be beneficial to existing manufacturers but also will leave the door open so that new entrants to that scheme can get in and out of the scheme and present their credentials to government departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other element that I would like to touch on&mdash;briefly, because I know my colleague the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) would also like to make some comments&mdash;particularly relates to the purchasing function and the lack of training which was given to many of the people in the purchasing areas of a number of government departments and the lack of any career development plan for these people. There appeared to be a downgrading of their role and function in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that one of the most important roles that these people can play is to help the government to buy Australian products, but there has been a marked lack of training and career path for them to follow. I hope that the government will address that so that there is a clear career path for them and they do receive the appropriate training to enable them to consider the whole of life of a product and certainly look at Australian products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chairman of the committee touched on the credit card issue. There is no doubt that this issue is quite startling. The evidence and the initial poor response that we received from the government departments on the issue of and the lack of control over the use of these credit cards were quite frightening&mdash;particularly because, as the chairman mentioned, some of the limits on those credit cards were $800,000 per annum. I think one of them might have even been up to the one million mark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those credit cards were being issued to people virtually without any accountability at all. That matter was addressed to some extent by the Australian National Audit Office. It was one of the major problems in the inquiry. One of the things that we did uncover in the government's purchasing policies was that they were without constraint, without accountability and without any credibility at all. In fact, as the chairman said, it was more expensive to use that system than it would be to use the more conventional ones. One would hope that the electronic commerce system, upon introduction by the government, would eliminate the need for many thousands of those credit cards to even be used. Once again, I compliment my colleagues on the committee and also the staff for their dedication to the task. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I support my colleagues in this report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Buying our future</EMPHASIS>. It is my view that this report will indeed send shock waves through the federal government bureaucracy. It is clear from our investigations&mdash;and we make it indelibly clear in this report&mdash;that there is a culture within the federal bureaucracy which says, `Buy overseas is good; buy Australian is bad'&mdash;or at least second choice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is totally unacceptable that funds in the order of magnitude of $10 billion per year are devoted to spending taxpayers' money on goods which are supplied by other countries. We have to develop a culture in this country which says that Australian quality is equal to the best in the world, that our production capacity is as good as anywhere else, and that if we can make it then our government should buy it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I strongly support the major thrust of this report, and I strongly support the major recommendation of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, which basically is that the Commonwealth should maximise the Australian content of government purchasing. The committee&mdash;unfortunately, in my view&mdash;addressed a minor issue at the end of the report under the heading `Ethical Purchasing'. I had hoped, and indeed desired, that the committee's report would be unanimous. Unfortunately I find myself unable to agree with the section of the report entitled `Ethical Purchasing', and so the report in that regard contains my dissent. In that section, the committee says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a general rule, it is not appropriate to seek to impose Australian social standards on other nations which have different cultural attitudes and social structures.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, it goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, it is appropriate to ensure that Australian producers are not disadvantaged by having to meet higher standards than their competitors. The most clear-cut case where such care is needed is in relation to environmental issues.</PARA>
<PARA>The problem this leads us into is that through this report this committee is insisting that the government officers who are charged with purchasing responsibility&mdash;and remember that there are some 40,000 of them, with 16,000 government credit cards floating around all over the place&mdash;are going to make decisions about whether or not they should buy an article made in China because the wage in China is $1 a day instead of $10 an hour. Our social policy says that we should adhere to industrial relations regulations in this country, which we then through this policy will attempt to impose on other countries. This is an issue that we did not investigate in depth. It is my view that, unfortunately, the committee is in error in including it in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In principle, social policies are appropriate for Australia to apply to our firms and our companies. But how on earth can we tell other countries that they must adhere to the same policies or we will not buy from them? In a practical sense it is a bureaucratic impossibility; in an ideological sense it is just straight wrong. We have no right to impose our social policies on other countries through a purchasing policy. What on earth gives us that right? If we exercise it, in effect we are negating all of the GATT agreements. GATT says we can discriminate on behalf of our own companies and products but not so far as to impose our will on other countries or else to say we will not buy from them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, all countries differ in their mix of social policies. That is demonstrably true. So for us to say that our policies are right and those of country X, Y or Z are wrong, and for us to take action in a demonstrable sense through purchasing policy, is just plain nonsense. Further, I believe that the recommendation that we made in that respect is flawed. While there is some justification for taking account of paper manufacturing with respect to environmental policies that this government has imposed on the paper manufacturers, particularly with respect to recycling, it seems to me that there is little justification for singling out one policy&mdash;that is, the environment&mdash;in terms of the recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report deals in one respect with the credit card issue that I referred to earlier. Today the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) responded to a question which I asked him earlier this month with respect to what he is doing in his department to control the possibility of fraud and the abuse of government credit cards. He said then that he did not know. Today he gave a longwinded response from his bureaucrats. In effect, the minister does not know. How could he?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are 16,000 of those things floating around out there. They are not credit cards like you and I use, Mr Deputy Speaker; they are payment cards. So cardholders can go to a brothel and quote their credit card number. The docket could come in for `goods' and be automatically paid in 14 days. And there can be no fraud! The government has a lot to answer for when it comes to 16,000 plastic cards floating around the community. The government needs to answer because it is its continuing contempt for this parliament and for the people of Australia that lets this kind of abuse occur. </PARA>

The opposition will not oppose this bill. We wish the new President of the Industrial Relations Commission well. She does not bring to the job a particular background in industrial relations. That may not of itself be a handicap. I would not want to be one to argue that because one has had no background in industrial relations one is disqualified from talking about or adjudicating upon issues of industrial relations. Indeed, there are many in the community who believe that one of the problems with the Australian industrial relations system is that it is bedevilled with experts, with members of the club, with people who are steeped in the folklore and the mystique of industrial relations, who communicate with each other in the arcane language of the industrial relations practitioner, who nod gravely about the industrial realities and who generally treat themselves far too seriously.</PARA></TALK.START>

We acknowledge the social contribution made by trade unions in the past and the continuing social contribution of trade unions in Australia at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is undeniable evidence that the changes to industrial relations law enacted by this government only a few weeks ago are going to have an adverse effect on employment in this country. It passes very strange to me, and I am sure to many millions of Australians, that the one area where we are really going backwards instead of forwards is in the area of industrial relations. I have rarely seen such calculated, brazen hypocrisy than the behaviour of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) before the recent Premiers Conference, or COAG meeting as it is now called. I think we are cursed in this country with these wretched acronyms. It was a meeting of the Premiers Conference. Premiers are premiers whether they call themselves a council of Australian governments or not. Everybody out there understands what a Premiers Conference is. I do not think a minuscule percentage of the population has any idea of what a COAG meeting is. So let us call it what it is and what people in plain ordinary English understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister had a Premiers Conference in Hobart a few weeks ago to urge them to adopt uniform approaches to competition in the Australian economy. I have no problem with that. Nobody is a stronger advocate of competition than I. The coalition has been in the forefront over the years in advocating more competition in the Australian economy. It has always been the Labor Party practising catch-up politics when it comes to greater competition in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially what the Prime Minister took to the Premiers Conference was a proposal that the Australian premiers adopt and implement so far as they can within their spheres of responsibility the representations of Professor Hilmer's report. What Professor Hilmer really said was that you should allow more competition in the professions; that you should allow more competition in government utilities; that you should have a competitive pricing approach to many services that are now controlled by state government legislation, and that you should open up the power utilities and the other service providers which are really semi-government authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have no argument with that. We support it. We have advocated it for a long time. Professor Hilmer also urged that there be competition in the professions. As a person who still proudly holds a practising certificate as a lawyer in New South Wales, I have no argument with competition in the legal profession. I have no desire to see restrictive practices in my profession of origin, the legal profession. I have no desire to see a continuation of restrictive practices in any other profession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do think in passing that there is a fair amount of nonsense talked about some of the changes that are needed in the professions. It escapes me what advantage accrues to litigants by governments willy-nilly abolishing the office of queen's counsel. The market will produce senior counsel whether you call them queen's counsel or not. Those who think that abolishing the office of queen's counsel will reduce legal fees in Australia ought to have a look at the American system. Is somebody going to tell me that some lawyers do not charge higher fees in the United States than other lawyers? Is somebody going to tell me that the sort of plebeian approach that they adopt in the United States produces cheaper justice? I would have thought that the one jurisdiction we should avoid like the plague when it comes to the legal profession is the American jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">America is an expensive and litigation drenched society that is too scared to do anything through fear of being sued. Doctors do not stop at road accidents in the United States now through fear that they will be sued for professional negligence by some of the unfortunate victims. God forbid that this country should ever allow the televising of court proceedings, which would be the living end. But there are plenty of people in the bleachers who say, `We have to go down this path and open it all up'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some rules that surround court proceedings in the legal profession in this country were put there for a very good reason. They were put there to preserve a certain degree of anonymity and a certain distance between the litigant and the procedure. It so happens that if the relationship is made too cosy a sense of contempt is induced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am straying a little from the bill, but my remarks are not unrelated to the point that we are all in favour of competition. So, one would imagine, is the government. But here comes the hypocrisy, nerve and gall. I notice that the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) is smiling. It may well be the smile of an embarrassed co-conspirator in the greatest continuing monopoly in Australia: the monopoly of the bargaining process held by the trade union movement. </PARA>

Surely if it is good enough to say to the lawyers and accountants of Australia, `Go out into the marketplace and win your market share and open up your profession to competition' it is good enough to say to the trade union movement of Australia, `You also should be exposed to competition'. It should not be exposed to persecution or victimisation. Every time those opposite talk about this subject, they depict our attitude, and my attitude in particular, as being one of hostility towards the trade union movement. It is not. My attitude is one of hostility to the monopoly privileges that the trade union movement enjoys in this country which are enjoyed by no other section of Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only one section of Australian society has a guaranteed market share: the trade union movement. The Australian Labor Party does not even have a guaranteed market share. It has to go out and fight for votes and support. The Liberal and National parties do not have a guaranteed market share. The local church does not have a guaranteed market share. The local priest does not have a guaranteed congregation every Sunday or Saturday night or whatever. The person opening up a small business does not have a guaranteed set of customers. The government cannot apply the rules that apply to the rest of the community to the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is wrong with industrial relations in Australia is that the law still gives monopoly privileges and power to the trade union movement. That is what the Liberal and National parties want to change. Once that goes, I believe that there will be competition in industrial relations. For the life of me, I cannot understand how any government could have the nerve to allow this to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would need to have the unspeakable gall of the current Prime Minister of Australia to go without any sense of embarrassment. He is very fond of saying, `You Liberals have no shame', but he is the last person who can deride other people for not having any shame. He can go down to Hobart and say, `The Commonwealth has done everything that it could be expected to do on the subject of competition. It is now up to the states to let the winds of competition blow through their utilities and the professions. But, for heaven's sake, don't ask me to require that of those who gave us political birth', which is the trade union movement of Australia. If ever there were a monumental example of hypocrisy and a double standard, that is it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter has nothing to do with whether people belong or do not belong to trade unions; it has everything to do with whether one believes there should be one law for one section of society and one law for another. Until this breathtaking example of prime ministerial and Australian Labor Party hypocrisy is removed, there will continue to be a view in the Australian community that, when it comes to the hard interests of the trade union movement of this country, this government is led by the nose.

There are many men and women opposite of great fair mindedness and quality who I know would bring to this debate a degree of such fair mindedness on this subject. They always avoid this issue by launching erratic, smearing attacks on us. They say that we are anti-worker and that we want to drive the worker into the ground. They go on with this sort of nonsense every time. It is pretty strange for a party that has given this country one million unemployed. Perhaps it can explain to us why it is that the unemployment rate in the United States is four per cent below what it is in Australia. Perhaps it can explain to the one million unemployed why it is maintaining a system that is producing that kind of result.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the government is doing with the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill, which will come into operation at the end of this month, is making the system more rigid. It is going in precisely the opposite direction in which it should be going. It is going down an anti-competitive path rather than a pro-competitive path. It is making it more expensive for small business to employ people in this country. The government must realise that if we are ever to have any hope in this country of reducing the appalling level of long-term unemployed it must do something to lighten the employment capacity of small business. The government will not save the unemployed by relying on big business; it will save the unemployed only by providing incentives to small business to employ people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small business is coming back into its own in this country. In 20 years, there will be a much greater percentage of people employed by small business in Australia than is the case at present. In the 1970s and 1980s, the view in the corporate world was that big is beautiful, that all one had to do is merge, come together and amalgamate. The bigger it got, the better it was and there were all the economies of scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has all begun to change in the 1990s. One reason it has changed is that there has been an explosion in communications. Things like personal computers, mobile telephones and fax machines have given to small business an independence, power, authority and capacity to survive and do well that was undreamt of even five or, certainly, 10 years ago. This process will continue. In 10 or 20 years, more and more people will be employed by small business. That has enormous implications for Australia's industrial relations system. It means that we will need a system that is more accommodating to small business rather than a system that tries to squeeze the small business model into a pattern that is really designed for big business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's industrial relations system is still built upon the notion that employment in Australia overwhelmingly comprises large numbers of blue-collar workers employed in one spot by a big company. The criticism that I and many others have had of Australia's industrial relations system over the years is not that we should not accommodate the BHPs, the Fords, the CSRs and so forth&mdash;they are an important part of the scene&mdash;but that we need to have a system which, as well as accommodating them, also accommodates the small- and medium-sized firms. This becomes more necessary as time goes by, because the future belongs to the small firm and the small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The success that is being achieved on the export front is increasingly to be found in the small niche operators. The government&mdash;I have no quarrel with this&mdash;keeps giving us examples of joint ventures that have opened up in China. It keeps talking about the success that Australia is having in selling into the Asia-Pacific region. I hope that we are. To the extent that we are, I unreservedly welcome it, as does every honourable member on this side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the government then forgets to acknowledge is that a very large slice of that additional export cake is being taken by the small business sector. It is that small business sector that wants a different industrial relations system. This is a theme that the House has heard me dwell on in the past and I will keep on dwelling on it because it is a very much tied up with the future of this country. We should have an industrial relations system that recognises that we are essentially two worlds: we have a small number of very large companies that employ lots of people, most of whom belong to trade unions, and the rest are small- and medium-sized firms which employ a lot of people too, just about none of whom belong to trade unions and none of whom want to belong to trade unions. </PARA>

There was a time when the Industrial Relations Commission was the thing that stood between all that was good and holy and the alleged darkness and chaos of the deregulated alternative so far as the government was concerned. That was until April 1991 when the Industrial Relations Commission, under the courageous leadership of the late Barry Maddern&mdash;I say that quite deliberately because he did display courage in that particular decision&mdash;rejected what the government had put to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a fit of what can only be called great petulance and intense personal hostility, the Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Kelty, the then Treasurer and the now Prime Minister turned their guns on the Industrial Relations Commission. For six or nine months or more we were treated to the argument that the people who decided industrial relations in Australia were the accord partners: the Labor government and the ACTU.

We have no argument that the law of this country at present&mdash;unfortunately but nonetheless undeniably&mdash;is for an industrial relations system that falls a long way short of what we want and what is in the best interests of Australia's economic future and is certainly an industrial relations system that belongs to a bygone era. It always amuses me that, in the Prime Minister's frequent tirades against the coalition and me personally, he identifies me with earlier periods in Australian history. When it comes to industrial relations, there is nobody more rooted in the discredited past of Australian history than the Prime Minister of this country. He is a supporter of a system that essentially belongs to pre-World War I days in Australia rather than to the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Fisher reminded me to say something about the composition of the commission. If memory serves me correctly, there are about 14 or 15 deputy presidents of the Industrial Relations Commission. I may be out by one or two, but it is in that order. If memory also serves me correctly, of those 14 or 15 it can roughly be said that two of them come out of the broad employer stable, two of them come out of what can be called the government stable&mdash;one of them is Mr Keogh, a former head of the Department of Industrial Relations&mdash;and it can fairly be said that the rest of them come out of the broad trade union stable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the appointment of Mr Iain Ross, no fewer than five deputy presidents of the Industrial Relations Commission will have come straight out of the ACTU office.

In some cases, some might even irreverently suggest that it is a resting place for some tiring industrial warriors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons why these great centralists in the Labor Party never want to see the dismantling of the state industrial relations infrastructure is that they still want their state industrial commissions on which to place those senior union officials who perhaps are becoming a bit of a problem. They still want the local option, the local patronage, to buy off some of the recalcitrants that might exist within their own ranks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To have 14 or 15 deputy presidents and to have the sort of imbalance in their background that I have described&mdash;and I am sure that I am broadly right&mdash;is outrageous.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government shouts and screams when it comes to matters of gender, race, total equality and lack of discrimination. But, when it comes to industrial relations, the government has an absolute blind spot. It is prepared to tolerate blatant discrimination in the workplace. It is prepared to allow people who do not belong to unions to lose jobs that they would otherwise win on the basis of merit. I had brought to my attention only a couple of days ago an advertisement that had been published in a paper in the western suburbs of Sydney inviting people to enlist in a program for trainers being run by not racehorse trainers but trainers for a program under the Department of Employment, Education and Training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the bottom of the advertisement soliciting applicants, it said, `Preference will be given to people who are members of such and such a union'. There is not even an attempt to disguise the fact that preference is given to people who belong to unions. The government thinks that is all right; that is different. Yet if we use the wrong word with some of these cultural fundamentalists who lurk in government departments and academic establishments, we are hounded for being some kind of out of date sexist or whatever. </PARA>

But when it comes to something that really matters, and that is people trying to get a job, it is not a question of merit&mdash;people who belong to a union get a preference. That is going on right now, in March 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industrial Relations Amendment Bill does nothing to prevent that occurring. Members of the government talk about the ILO and our international obligations yet, when it comes to such a fundamental thing as the right of people to compete for a job based on merit, where are government members? They are nowhere to be seen. The reason is that the unions heavy them and say, `Look, when it comes to the crunch, push to shove, you people have to make certain that preference is given to members of a trade union'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are very simple concepts. We can argue and accept that we are going to have eternal differences on other issues. But, when it comes to these fundamental issues of people's rights, this government&mdash;which boasts its anti-discrimination credentials and lectures us day in and day out about how it believes in equality of the sexes and equality of this and that&mdash;does not believe in equality of employment opportunity in the workplace. It says that unionists get jobs ahead of non-unionists. I think that is wrong.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I preface my remarks by echoing the sentiments expressed last year by the Minister for Industrial Relations, that Labor's industrial relations policies will always remain true to the principles of fairness that have underpinned a century of conciliation and arbitration. We really have to look at the history of industrial relations in this country and the commitment that Labor governments have had to fair play for the Australian work force and, of course, to a very effective trade union movement that has been responsible for looking after the interests of its members over those many years. The comments of the honourable member for Bennelong outline again the great differences between us on this side of the House and those on the other side of the House when it comes to industrial relations. It is a pretty fair mark why they are over there and we are over here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industrial Relations Amendment Bill 1994 seeks to amend sections 10, 15, 16 and 21 of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 in order to facilitate the appointment of a new president of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission&mdash;the AIRC. The amendments allow for the appointment of Justice Deirdre O'Connor to this position. They expressly provide the means whereby a judge of a court created by the parliament can hold the office of President of the AIRC. In addition, the legislation allows the appointment to be on a fixed term basis, for a period of five years, as opposed to the current system of tenure lasting until the statutory retirement age of 65. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As announced by the Minister for Industrial Relations on 28 February, the government has recommended to the Governor-General the appointment of Justice Deirdre O'Connor to the presidency of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Justice O'Connor comes to the position with a wealth of experience and a distinguished record as a judge of the Federal Court and as current President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. In addition to these positions, she has also chaired the former Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and, most importantly, she is a former commissioner of the New South Wales Law Reform Commission and has practised as a barrister specialising in industrial issues related to workers compensation. Before this, she was a senior lecturer in law at Macquarie University. She is certainly a person with a wide range of experience who I am sure will be a very worthy appointment to the presidency of the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is good news indeed to see the appointment of a highly qualified woman to such an important position. But it is most important that we acknowledge that she is well qualified in her own right to hold the position, not simply because she is a woman. The appointment of Justice O'Connor will help to address the gender imbalance on the commission where at present women occupy only four of the 16 presidential  positions. With regard to the fixed term tenure, it is important to stress that subsection 16(1A), which will allow the next president of the commission to be appointed for a fixed term, will apply only to Justice O'Connor. The government will retain its policy which states that the members of the commission will normally be appointed until statutory retiring age. Justice O'Connor requested a five-year term as she wishes to return to her duties on the Federal Court. As has already been stated, this is the first time a fixed term tenure has been provided, but the government is prepared to make this one-off provision in the light of Justice O'Connor's outstanding abilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other amendments will protect Justice O'Connor's present tenure on the Federal Court, as she has expressed the wish to return to the Federal Court. The new section 15A will provide that the appointment of a judge of a court created by the federal parliament will not affect that judge's tenure of office or salary and privileges. It also provides that a judge's service as president is to be taken as service as a judge. The proposed section will ensure that Justice O'Connor's appointment as president will not affect her entitlements. The remuneration of a person who is president and a judge is dealt with in clause 6, which will amend section 21 of the act. This amendment provides that the salary payable to such a person as a judge is less than that payable to the president. That person is to be paid an allowance equal to the difference and no other remuneration is payable to the person due to his or her being President of the AIRC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appointment of Justice O'Connor to the presidency of  the AIRC is in line with the government's intended goals in the arena of industrial relations. Last year, the Minister for Industrial Relations brought down one of the most comprehensive and responsible industrial relations reform bills this nation has seen. In it, the government aimed to formulate a framework of legislation and institutions that will allow for fair, mutually advantageous bargaining, while protecting the interests of both parties. The central feature of that legislation is its vigilance in protecting those who have little to bargain. This weaker party in the bargaining process is almost invariably the employee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation gives employees the assurance that they will not be worse off as a result of the bargaining process.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a considerable amount of public comment on the nomination of Justice O'Connor. Some opposition members have claimed that it is some sort of payback to the union movement. The only people we have to pay back are the Australian people who showed their faith in the Labor Party's commitment to social justice at the last election. They completely rejected the opposition's industrial relations policies. Why would they not? The $3 an hour youth wage, the dismantling of the Industrial Relations Commission and the removal of the awards system are policies that could never have won the approval of the people. Now we are subjected to the spectacle of the opposition casting around for a new leader when it should be casting around for decent policies for a change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to Justice O'Connor's appointment, we have heard accusations of changing legislation to suit the whim of an individual. In the other chamber, Senator Chapman accused the government of all sorts of hideous acts. According to him, the government is rushing this legislation through parliament. Then he said that we were casting around for someone to head the new Industrial Relations Court. In addition to this, statements have been made by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry questioning Justice O'Connor's qualifications and saying that the government should have consulted with employers before making the appointment. In all cases, they have said what a highly regarded institution the Federal Court is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chapman said that it was unnecessary to create a new court, as the Industrial Relations Division of the Federal Court could handle all industrial relations matters. Under the new legislation, that division's duties will be taken over by the new court. Senator Chapman neglected to mention how the appointment of a judge of the Federal Court to the presidency of the AIRC could be construed as a problem. By his own admission, the judges of the Federal Court have the skills, expertise and independence to do that job, yet he saw something wrong with the appointment of a respected Federal Court judge to the AIRC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Law Council of Australia has made similar statements with regard to the Industrial Relations Court. It said that `the established, experienced, well-equipped and well-regarded Federal Court' should be given the duties of the new court. Once again, it did not mention how the appointment of a member of the established, experienced, well-equipped and well-regarded Federal Court could hinder the new court's effectiveness. All of these statements seem to indicate that these objectives doubt Justice O'Connor's independence and competence, yet they all accept that the Federal Court is staffed by competent, independent judiciary who would all be interested in knowing the reasons for the contradiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is misguided to think that our courts should not have particular areas of expertise.

However, in complex matters like industrial relations, I think it will be very beneficial to have a court dealing specifically in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Justice O'Connor will be the first female President of the AIRC. This will prove to be a step forward for women in the arena of industrial relations. As 51 per cent of Australia's population is female, it is only right that the AIRC be headed by a woman of ability and skill. If the low rate of female union membership is to be rectified, steps like this need to be taken to encourage women to get involved in the movement. It is high time that a talented and capable woman occupied a position like this, and I believe it is a great move for that reason alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some comment about the future relationship with the state industrial relations bodies. The act provides for cooperation between the AIRC and state bodies and allows members of the AIRC to also be appointed to the AIRC. The AIRC also has the power to hear disputes that come under the jurisdiction of state authorities where a state law authorises this. The act also provides that the president can invite heads of state industrial authorities to regular meetings to encourage cooperation between the federal and state bodies. Everyone is jumping the gun by saying that Justice O'Connor's appointment will jeopardise the relations between the bodies. I believe that Justice O'Connor will bring a level of competence and professionalism to the AIRC as well as a fresh approach that will encourage the cooperation of state bodies. </PARA>

We are saying that the government is a government of the unions, by the unions, for the unions. I am quite happy for government members to come into the chamber and debate the subject of the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill&mdash;indeed, it is appropriate for those matters to be debated&mdash;but it is quite surprising to hear the honourable member for Oxley saying that the proposed appointment of Justice Deirdre O'Connor is an important step in redressing the imbalance of women in the trade union movement.

Justice O'Connor may well be a woman of great ability. She may well have been appointed on merit, but I think it is quite wrong and demeaning to Justice O'Connor for the honourable member for Oxley to say that her appointment will encourage women to join the trade union movement.

It is a disappointing and unnecessary bill, in that it amends a piece of unnecessary legislation brought into the House last year. As the honourable member for Bennelong pointed out, the government is moving in the area of industrial relations in precisely the wrong direction. The government is full of free enterprise for the professions&mdash;the lawyers, the doctors, the chartered accountants and so many other areas. We will hear more from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) at the Premiers Conference on the need to open up industry and the professions to competition. We are not opposed to competition, but the government is absolutely hypocritical.

But we must be&mdash;indeed, the Australian people will be&mdash;very suspicious of the government's motives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Oxley referred in glowing terms to the quality of Federal Court judges. By and large, I agree that this nation can be proud of the Federal Court of Australia. But the government clearly is not proud of the Federal Court, because it took the secondary boycott provisions away from that court and gave the responsibility for that part of the law to the new Industrial Relations Court. The federal government has treated the Federal Court with some disrespect, despite the honourable member for Oxley claiming that it is a wonderful institution. In my view and, indeed, in the view of the opposition, the Federal Court should have been the court to administer, as it has done so well over so many years, the secondary boycott provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industrial Relations Amendment Bill, which is before the House, is a special bill for special people. It entrenches the government's principle of special deals for special people. Justice O'Connor is the beneficiary of the amendments which are before the House. The amendments are being debated simply to enable Justice O'Connor to perform the role of President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission while continuing as a judge of the Federal Court&mdash;a special deal for a special person and, while one does not want to criticise Justice O'Connor personally, almost a deal for a mate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation will enable Justice O'Connor to remain as a judge of the Federal Court. It will ensure that her tenure as a judge will not be affected by her presidency. It appoints her for a fixed term of five years rather than until she is 65. If the rules which will apply to future presidents were to apply to Justice O'Connor, that would be 12 years. The legislation also enables Justice O'Connor to receive a presidential allowance on top of her judge's salary. Also, there has been some criticism&mdash;the government really should consider it seriously&mdash;that the arbitral and judicial functions are being somewhat confused as a result of the appointment of Justice O'Connor while allowing her to remain a judge of the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Oxley said that Justice O'Connor will be the first woman president of this institution.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the appointment of Justice O'Connor has been made on merit. I am not worried that she does not have a great deal of experience in the area of industrial relations&mdash;apparently she has done some work in the field of workers compensation&mdash;because I believe that industrial relations law really ought to be handled by the ordinary courts. So I do not have a problem with the fact that she does not come from the industrial relations club. But, if the government has not made this appointment on the basis of merit, I will certainly be very disappointed. All appointments should be made on the basis of merit. The government is sometimes very keen on equal opportunity and affirmative action. On this side of the parliament, we are very much in favour of the right and the best person being appointed to a position, regardless of whether that person happens to be a man or a woman. </PARA>

We do have some reason to be suspicious since this special piece of legislation applies only to Justice Deirdre O'Connor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government talks a lot about fairness. The honourable member for Oxley said that the government's approach to industrial relations has been fair. The government is really interested only in being fair to trade unions; it is not interested in being fair to the Australian work force. The honourable member for Bennelong pointed out that only 30 per cent of private sector employees have chosen to become members of a union. The honourable member for Oxley referred in glowing terms to the government's administration of industrial relations. Mind you, I think that administration has been an unmitigated disaster. But the government is clearly only interested in being fair to that section of the work force which supports it, namely, the trade union movement. The trade unions themselves would be the first to admit that they have a major problem because Australian workers, in ever increasing numbers, are saying that they do not want to be part of the trade union movement. </PARA>

That would present the government with a major problem at election time. We all know how much money is pumped into the government coffers from the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government lied its way to victory in the 13 March election last year. It received very large donations from trade unions. That is why the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) was forced to bring into the parliament last year the Industrial Relations Bill.

At a time when Australia should be looking at world best practice, we find that the government is moving backwards rather than forwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also find that the government is relying on the external affairs treaty powers to give it some authority to legislate in relation to so-called minimum conditions.

The government really should have looked at the amendments in this bill at the time it brought in the original bill. That the government has now had to come in here with what amounts to an amending piece of legislation indicates that its administration in the area of industrial relations is in complete disarray. It is totally disorganised. It is moving in an ad hoc way. It has not even thought through the long-term legislation it wants. Only a couple of months after we had discussed in the parliament a major piece of industrial relations legislation, the minister is back seeking further amendments to facilitate the appointment of Justice Deirdre O'Connor as president of the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It really is a worry that special legislation is being brought in to encourage an individual to accept this position. The government likes to talk a lot about independence for Australia and about Australia taking its place in the world. But the reality is that, with international treaties the government is constantly signing, Australia's sovereignty is being eroded. Of course, the treaties which are being entered into on industrial relations will erode the sovereignty of this nation in that area to the extent that there can be appeals to UN committees in the area of industrial relations.</PARA>

It is interesting to note that the government speakers on this bill have not turned up&mdash;they have withdrawn from the speakers' list&mdash;so there is not a great deal of commitment to what their executive is doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has made a disgraceful attempt at reform in the area of industrial relations. At the end of last year, just prior to Christmas, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) introduced the main bill. The point from which the government started and the point at which it ended up with that bill is just outrageous. The people of Australia know exactly what happened. They know that the ACTU pulled all the levers and told the government what to put in and what to take out. Now we have a continuation of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill we are debating tonight contains a provision which enables a judge of the Federal Court to concurrently hold the position of President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission on a fixed term. This bill stems from the government's decision to nominate Justice Dierdre O'Connor for appointment as President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission for a five-year term. There are lots of problems with the appointment of Justice O'Connor and with this amending bill. The obvious criticism that has been run through the media is the alleged connection between Justice O'Connor and the Australian Labor Party&mdash;in particular, her links with the Minister for Industrial Relations and the right wing faction in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Justice O'Connor's experience in the field of industrial relations has also been criticised. Section 10 of the principal act provides that the Governor-General may only appoint a person as president if he or she satisfies certain criteria. One criterion provides that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in the opinion of the Governor-General, the person is, because of skills and experience in the field of industrial relations, a suitable person to be appointed as President.</PARA>
<PARA>I am in no position to criticise Justice O'Connor personally. I have never met her; I have no association whatsoever with her. However, I agree with the argument put forward by Mr Noakes, the Executive Director of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who argues that it would have been far better if the person appointed had the experience as required by the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nomination for appointment of Justice O'Connor contained three departures from previous practice. Firstly, she will retain her position as a judge of the Federal Court while she is president of the IRC. Section 15 of the Industrial Relations Act 1988, the principal act, provides that, while a person may hold an appointment under the principal act and at the same time hold an office on a federal tribunal, he or she may not hold an appointment under the principal act and be a member of a court created by the parliament, and that includes the Federal Court. Therefore, this amending legislation is before the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, Justice O'Connor's appointment will be for a fixed period of five years. Currently, section 16 of the principal act provides that members of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission hold office until they resign or reach the age of 65. Her appointment will be the first for a fixed term. In a press release dated 28 February 1994 the minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The five-year term will apply only to Justice O'Connor. The government's policy remains that members of the Commission should normally be appointed up to the statutory retirement age of 65 years, but we are prepared to make a one-off provision for Justice O'Connor in light of her outstanding qualities. Future Presidents will be appointed under the usual provisions.</PARA>
<PARA>The third significant feature of her appointment is that she will be the first woman to head the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. It is an interesting aspect and was alluded to quite a bit through the address by the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott). Only time will tell but one would certainly hope that this is not tokenism, that this is not gender bias. We hope that Justice O'Connor is being appointed by the government to this position, albeit through the means of this amending legislation to get around the principal act, on her merits and her qualities to dispense the obligations that she will have in this job. This is an important issue because the Minister for Industrial Relations is changing the laws of this country to suit this one appointment. It is a very dangerous precedent that this Labor government continues to set by tampering with the laws of this country to suit its own personal agendas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A more important criticism, however, is the precedent this government is setting by mixing judicial and quasi-legislative powers. Whilst I understand the justice in question will not be exercising both powers at the same time, the government is again tampering with the laws of the land by mixing the two together. This was stated by the High Court during the boilermakers case, where it ruled that it is unconstitutional for a body to exercise both powers&mdash;and it certainly can be argued that Justice O'Connor is in a position where she is doing just that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since I entered the House of Representatives just over a year ago, I have been amazed by the way this Labor government has used its majority in this place to change the laws of this land to suit its own imperial agendas. It has treated the institutions of this country, that have endured since federation, with absolute contempt. I think the way this whole industrial relations reform process has taken place has been a disgrace for this country. The word `reform' is wrong; it is a misuse of the queen's English. It is not reform; it is a retrograde step in industrial relations. This parliament is about to address a document on national competition, yet we have this disgraceful piece of legislation being put through this parliament that is going to get royal assent later on this month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot believe the favours that the government does for the ACTU&mdash;and we know why it does them. My concerns are probably best summarised by that now famous quote by Jennie George, the Vice-President of the ACTU, who said:</PARA>

<PARA>It is a payback for the millions of dollars that the ACTU stoked into the coffers of the Australian Labor Party to win government in 1993. This Labor government has shown absolute contempt for the law and procedures, and has shown implicit contempt for the institution it professes to defend.

All these individuals come directly from the office of Bill Kelty. If it is not so important whether these people have a union background or an employer's background, why are all these major appointments coming straight out of the ACTU?</PARA>
<PARA>That is a question that the people of Australia must ask. Are we going to get biased or unbiased decisions coming out of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission when we have five out of that number of vice-presidents coming straight from the ACTU? Why? So the Australian Labor Party can pay back the ACTU for the favours that it has done over the years. Ms Jenny Acton was going to be one of the contestants in a preselection in Hotham, but the payback for her stepping out of that preselection to allow the current honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) to win it is a seat on the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The people of Australia need to know these things. They need to know the disgusting way that this government treats these very important institutions in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was recently reading a book which tried to separate reigning and ruling, the two operative words in the political system of a developmental state. The book argued that developmental states, such as Australia, create a situation where politicians reign but the bureaucrats rule. I would add one more dimension to this in current Australian political history. It is true to argue that, while politicians reign, bureaucrats and the ACTU rule. This is being borne out and proven every day that we sit in this place and see the things that the Labor government is doing&mdash;the ACTU in Australia rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is sickening to think that this government is merely a puppet for the main player in today's political life&mdash;the Australian Council of Trade Unions. I emphasise this absurdity in government policy by referring to the Hilmer report. This report, supposedly a report on national competition policy, argues for the opening up of nearly every section of industry and business to the forces of competition in a joint approach. However, the obvious control that the ACTU has over this government becomes obvious when on page 24 of the executive overview it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Specific exemptions set out in the Trade Practices Act. The committee sees a continuing role for some specific exemptions in the act itself. The current limited exemptions for labour agreements, standards, restrictive covenants, export contracts and consumer boycotts should be retained.</PARA>
<PARA>This government is telling the rest of Australia, `You become much more competitive. No protection, no assistance; you win your market share with best practices, not the labour market. You will have all the protection under the sun. You will have the protection of the Commonwealth government and the union movement'. There is no move to create complete competition as far as the labour market is concerned'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly, that is Labor's equity all right. If this government sees such wonders and benefit in developing a national competition policy, let us make it a full and complete national competition policy and ensure that not only controlled government business enterprises become competitive but also the labour market becomes competitive in the Australian marketplace. If they go out and make sure that they win their market share, and it is not handed to them on a plate, then the power is not maintained with the ACTU and handed to them by this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do these same wonders and benefits not apply when talking about labour agreements? By hamstringing labour market reform the government is in fact jeopardising the whole basis of a national competition policy. This reform will not be worth a crumpet unless this government is prepared to address that imbalance. If we force one side of the equation to become more competitive and open it up to the marketplace, we must force the other side as well. This is certainly a situation when bowing to its union mates which may cause a great deal of grief for this government, so it may as well be aware of that now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industrial Relations Commission's expanded responsibility, and the disproportionately large number of senior commission personnel who are drawn from the trade union movement, is typical of this government's lopsided approach to industrial relations reform. Indeed, the whole area of a separate court structure must be reviewed because the Law Council of Australia has argued that specialist courts are always going to be suspect because the concern is that they will do special deals for special people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are seeing these special deals taking place now with the appointment of Justice O'Connor; the introduction of this amendment before the House today; the appointment of Mr Ross, an ex-ACTU member, as head of the enterprise bargaining division of the commission; and the appointment of at least five deputy commissioners who are all ACTU officials. The government has made this a specialist court. I am quite sure that the government is fully aware of this, but it is using this whole process as a payback opportunity and a possible future legislative hurdle for genuine workplace reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be interesting to see, over the life of this new Industrial Relations Court, whether the special favours for special people approach by this government continues into the Federal Court. The bill allows for concurrent positions to be held and there will obviously be pressure on appointees to the new labour court to get concurrent positions on the more prestigious Federal Court. In the reverse, the appointment of Justice O'Connor from the Federal Court highlights the strength of the coalition argument that there really is no need for a new labour court. By appointing Federal Court judges to the labour court, there seems to be a great deal of unnecessary overlap in the procedure. I dismiss this amendment as more of the same from this minister who has made a practice throughout his career of doing special favours for special friends. It goes back more than 20 years, and we all know about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new labour court will create a dangerous precedent in Australian law, not only by confusing the balance of arbitral and judicial functions but also by creating confusion about section 10 of the principal act which deals with the appointment of the president. I think the one-off fixed term also has strange political implications. I question the legal power being handed over by this government to the authorities or ex-authorities within the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last six months of industrial relations has been nothing more than a joke. The Minister for Industrial Relations calls this the most important piece of legislative reform in industrial relations since 1904. That is rubbish. Industrial relations ministers have been repeating that claim like broken records over the last few years. For example, Minister Willis described the Industrial Relations Bill 1988 as `the most substantial revision of Australia's federal industrial relations system undertaken since the system was established in 1984'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is like a broken record in the area of industrial relations. It is bending over backwards to improve its relationship with the ACTU&mdash;and nothing else. Its reform package has done nothing but create more hurdles within the workplace and it has done nothing to introduce genuine flexibility into the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the reform package was introduced last October, there has been much comment within the community about this legislation. I want to read some of the comments I have read and collected from the newspapers:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will not assist in delivering the flexibility and productivity which is required if Australian industry is to become and remain internationally competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The insistence on allowing unions to be involved in agreements in non-unionised workplaces will be a serious inhibition on such agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The additional prescription of minimum standards through use of external affairs power to override the state jurisdictions where serious reform has been attempted is an unwarranted intrusion into areas of state authority.</PARA>
<PARA>These are the comments of people out there in the community. They are comments not from the so-called capitalists, as the members of the government call them, but from working people who are members of unions and who want to see genuine reform. Maybe this government started out with the intention of genuine reform at the beginning of last year, following the election. Maybe it intended to introduce some flexibility into the industrial relations arena, but it certainly did not end up that way, particularly with this amending bill that is before us tonight. The amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Bennelong, which I have seconded, states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:</PARA>

The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) called for a major document on national competition policy and that document has now been put before this parliament and the people of Australia. We are looking at opening up competition, not only to large and small business and to government, but also to government business enterprises&mdash;Commonwealth government business enterprises and state government business enterprises. But what is lacking? Who is not going to be opened up to competition in Australia? It is the trade union movement. </PARA>

His history here is one of setting up the potential to destroy the entire industrial relations system as we know it today and as we have known it in the past. It is interesting that, as this government in chaos fails, so also will the whole bureaucratic structure surrounding the award system, the Industrial Relations Commission and this new Industrial Relations Court, which is dealt with in this bill. They will all become subject to such immense pressure, such as the government frontbench is subjected to today, that they will cave in upon themselves. They are doomed to failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is so arrogant that it brought in a reform bill last December which is supposed to reform the system and improve productivity but which instead is absolutely nothing but a payback bill to the ACTU, the mates of those on the other side of the House. I note that one of my colleagues happens to be sitting on the wrong side of the House at the moment and I do not tar him with the same brush. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is a payback bill. There is no question about that because during the campaign leading up to the 13 March election the unions very clearly pulled out all stops, to a greater extent than we have known in modern history in Australia, funded the ALP campaign and put people on the ground to make sure that the ALP was returned and that our Prime Minister, now presiding over this chaotic government, was returned to guide the Australian people into chaos. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill really is unnecessary. In the first place, I fail to understand why the government found it necessary to create a specialist court to find unfair dismissal. Do we have in Australia so many cases of management in industry sacking people for no good cause that we need to set up an entire court system to deal with the issue? Is this court system destined to become an unfair dismissal finder? Is it in place to make sure there are unfair dismissals? It does beg the question. Perhaps it might find one or two cases, but will it manufacture them? That is entirely possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill creates special circumstances for a special court that Australia has not found to be necessary in the past. I personally find no problem with the minister's appointment of Justice Deirdre O'Connor as head of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. I think it is disappointing that special rules have to be made in the Industrial Relations Act in order to allow her to serve and for a limited period. Notwithstanding her background, one may assume that she is, as a Federal Court judge, impartial and unbiased and that she will fairly adjudicate those matters which properly come before her. I wish her well in her new job; I wish her no harm whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that her appointment as head now gives us someone from without the industrial relations system itself, to perhaps bring some objectivity into play. We have talked many times in this place about the industrial relations club. The industrial relations club is an object, I believe, that was defined some number of years ago by Max Newton&mdash;dear, departed Max. Max had some very unkind things to say about the industrial relations club because he thought it was incestuous. In fact, perhaps it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industrial Relations Reform Bill not only builds on those bureaucratic procedures which have been in place for a very long time but also enhances them so that, instead of making it easier for employers and employees to negotiate and decide on employees' wages and conditions of employment&mdash;in fact, on all of their working conditions; how they are going to structure their working lives&mdash;we are now making it more difficult. The number of procedures that are required in order to get certification of an enterprise agreement is absolutely horrific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could say positively that this amending bill is an employment generating piece of legislation because certainly we are going to enhance the livelihood of many solicitors and barristers who will appear in front of this jurisdiction. It has now become so legalistic and so difficult to defend one's position in respect of an award, to challenge a current position in respect of an award, to defend one's position in respect of having dismissed an employee, or for employees in fact to defend their position in terms of their rights in requesting more redress than they have been offered previously by their employer, that legal people will now be required to be involved and that means cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I guess we will employ more barristers, solicitors, clerks and secretaries, and probably cleaners to clean the offices. Perhaps we will fire up the construction industry again because more offices will now have to be built for the legal profession in order to be able to deal with industrial relations matters, matters which ought to be simply a matter of consent and agreement between one who wishes to employ and one who wishes to be employed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We talk frequently in this place&mdash;those on the government benches do as much as those on this side&mdash;about this thing called productivity. Productivity is an important issue. Clearly the government has over the past few years opened up our economy to competition both internally and externally. It has freed up the dollar, it has freed our financial institutions from the constraints under which they operated and it has helped to break down tariff barriers, which represented a huge protectionist wall around our country. For those things I applaud the government. I agree that it has done positive and good things. We talk today about meetings between the heads of government of the Commonwealth and the states in order to create some more micro-economic reform in order to break down some more of the barriers in order to introduce competition in government owned enterprises, particularly the utilities which affect all of us in an expense sense. All of these things are very positive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But when it comes to industrial relations we do not talk about productivity. We do not talk about gain. We talk about protection. That is what this court is all about. We are here talking about protection for union mates from this now chaotic government. That protection means that we are spending more money protecting people in unprotectable jobs and protecting work practices which in fact should have been thrown out with the ark. We spend all this time trying to protect retrenched positions and the union bureaucrats in their jobs, but we do not do one single thing about productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister on 21 April last gave such a terrific speech at the Institute of Company Directors in Melbourne and offered up so much hope to Australia and Australians that we would in fact finally deregulate our over-regulated industrial relations practices and that we would allow employers and employees to decide for themselves how they would work and for what wages and conditions. In his words, we would over time reduce the complexity of awards and reduce their impact in the community. But that is not what has happened. Those fine sentiments of the Prime Minister on 21 April have not translated into public policy in terms of legislation. </PARA>

Guess what? Surprise, surprise, he cannot offer her a job; he cannot give her a place. So we are denying her an employment opportunity.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! Earlier today the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) raised a matter of privilege on behalf of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. The honourable member advised the House that the committee had received a letter from a Mr Peter Pool, who had given evidence to the committee claiming to have been denied access to a defence establishment. Mr Pool claimed that his involvement with the committee inquiry had been cited as the reason for not denying him access and that he had been told that army officers would no longer talk to him because he had appeared before the committee. The honourable member stated that the committee had subsequently written to and received a letter from a Mr Ken Brown, who was present when Mr Pool was allegedly denied access to the defence premises, which lent some support to Mr Pool's claims.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have considered the information provided by the honourable member and the letters from Mr Pool and Mr Brown which the honourable member tabled. The punishment or imposition of a penalty on a person on account of having given evidence to a parliamentary committee is a well-established category of contempt. In addition, the Parliamentary Privileges Act provides for substantial penalties to be imposed on persons for offences in respect of witnesses or prospective witnesses. Having considered the information provided by the honourable member and having regard to the rules and practices of the House in these matters, I have concluded that a prima facie case exists. Accordingly, I am willing to allow precedence to a motion in respect of the matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As most honourable members know, since 1983 I have brought students from senior high schools within my electorate to the national capital on education scholarships. Tonight in the Speaker's gallery I have two such young people, who are the 35th and 36th students to participate in this scholarship. They are Rosalind Wadley, 15 years of age, a year 10 student from Narrogin senior high school, and Regan McClure, also 15 years of age, a year 10 student from Mount Barker senior high school. They are both in the gallery. I take the opportunity to thank Ansett Australia for its assistance in this educational program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my guests, these students are here to learn first-hand the operations of this parliament and to visit some of the points of interest in Canberra. Part of this arrangement is that my guests prepare a speech for me to deliver to the parliament. I will now proceed to do just that. Rosalind writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Narrogin&mdash;founded in the 1890's has a population of over 5,000 and is situated two and a half hours drive south-east of Perth. The word "Narrogin" is derived from an Aboriginal word meaning "water hole".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The town of Narrogin has developed from the railway line that runs through the middle of town. Most people living in Narrogin in the 1890s were farmers or they worked on the railway. The railway has since then partially closed down. It was originally used to transport goods, including primary produce and passengers to Perth and down to Albany. Road transport has taken over this job.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Narrogin has three primary schools, a senior high school, an agricultural school and a TAFE. The high school with a population of 900 has the largest government residential college in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The school has to cater for a vast and varying type of students and does so admirably with specialist courses in science, aeronautics and cricket. There is a large music department including three concert bands and various other ensembles. The school won the country week champion school trophy in 1993 and in fact has won this award for 15 out of the last 20 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The youth of the town turn sport into a huge social event and every Tuesday and Friday nights basketball attracts 500 participants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sporting teams from Narrogin compete against surrounding town teams such as Wagin, Wickepin and Cuballing, some teams travelling over two hundred kilometres to participate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The district has produced a number of state players. Many children also participate in the large music program Narrogin offers. The week long central south eisteddfod culminating in a talent concert is a highlight.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The town still retains its old fashioned family and country aspects such as preserving and jam making.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The centre of town is made up of beautiful old buildings in the colonial style. Many houses around town are large and of old brick, with bull-nosed verandas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Narrogin was one of the first towns to lead the way with street-scaping, recognising and retaining the </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">beauty in the old buildings. Narrogin as a town possesses a unique community feeling which shows in the enthusiasm in which citizens participate in town events like sport and picnics, festivals and exhibitions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a great town for families and for children to grow up feeling secure and appreciated. It is well worth the effort to drop in one day.</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that that comment is directed to you, Mr Acting Speaker. Regan writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Plantagenet area in the south-west of Western Australia serves a wide agricultural area. Previously noted for its apple growing, the emphasis is now on sheep, cattle and winegrowing. Mount Barker, the centre of the shire of Plantagenet, is an ideal holiday centre with ample shopping and recreation facilities as well as being within easy reach of the Stirling and Porongurup ranges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Mount Barker senior high school, situated on the northern edge of the Mount Barker townsite, has an enrolment of approximately 330 students. Along with the normal secondary subjects, agricultural courses are also on offer, as the school is situated on a farm.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sheep and cattle are raised, as well as the cultivating of grains, poultry, bees, vegetables, trees and a vineyard. Just recently an aquaculture system has been introduced. All students participating in the courses take an active role in hands-on farm work, such as shearing, harvesting and handling of stock.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Surrounded by unspoilt scenic countryside and beautifully kept school gardens and lawns, the Mount Barker senior high school is an idyllic location for the education of students. Standard subjects such as Maths, English, Science and Social Studies are well catered for in appropriate classrooms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sporting interests are given ample attention with a wide range of sports being played, the most popular being Aussie rules and cricket. Mount Barker has the reputation of being one of the best football schools in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the east of the high school are some of the biggest and oldest ranges in Western Australia, these being the Stirling and Porongurup ranges. The Stirling ranges provide a challenge for the adventurous in the climbing of Bluff Knoll, the highest peak standing at 1073 metres. There are also many tracks providing easy access to wildlife and flora. The Porongurup ranges allow easy walking tracks which lead to most of the peaks and spectacular views.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of Mount Barker's newest and most successful industries is viticulture. Wineries from all around the Plantagenet shire are gaining recognition state-wide, nationally and even overseas. Mount Barker's climate is ideal for the growing of top class Rhine Riesling, along with other varieties.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In his wiser moments not even Gerard Henderson would claim that one book written in 1952 and repudiated nearly 30 years ago in 1968 would provide the evidence for such a monstrous assertion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">About Journey Into The Future Frank Hardy confided in me `I would dream that dream again.' Millions of people, besides Hardy, were vulnerable to the claims of the Stalinist propagandists that Soviet Communism represented a transitionary stage to an ideal socialist society.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was part of their philosophy, their belief system, their idealism for a world free of oppression. The carefully staged presentation of Soviet society to visitors helped to confirm their confidence in and commitment to a real new world order with real democracy, real freedom, real equality, real security.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They were the big issues of Hardy's time. In his pursuit of those ideals, he was not wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Henderson also said "Sure Hardy did some kind things." Juxtaposed against his "support for oppressors" claim that is a gratuitous and patronising statement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian peanut industry is one of our nation's great industries. Over recent years, it has suffered from poor seasons and an ageing infrastructure. Chinese imports have done great damage to markets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year's crop is somewhat better. It has enjoyed better seasons, although disease and pest pressure have created many problems for local farmers. The harvest is about to begin. It promises to be a better harvest than in previous years, although aflatoxin build-up is certain to be a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every so often, there is a breakthrough in farm machinery design that brings a technological advance which provides new hope for an industry. There have been many in the peanut industry over the years. When mechanical pulling replaced the back-breaking hand work and when mechanical harvesting, mobile thrashing, bulk-handling and artificial drying came along, all were significant advances for the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another breakthrough is now available to the industry. A new harvesting machine has been developed in America called the Magnum Fource. It has about treble the capacity of any existing machinery. It can harvest high moisture peanuts, which will have the radical advantage of being able to reduce the risk and quality loss that is associated with weeks of curing peanuts in the field. It will also prevent the build-up of aflatoxin, perhaps the most serious threat to the peanut industry, by enabling the crop to be harvested quickly and then artificially dried. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Australia is to keep up with the rest of the world, it must have this harvesting technology. A handful of these machines have been imported into Australia, but they are penalised with a 10 per cent duty. Early in 1993, the industry sought a tariff concession on the import of this peanut machinery. There are a couple of local manufacturers in the Kingaroy area but between them they have sold only one machine over the last two years. That has partly been due to poor economic circumstances. But, when new technology comes along, it is very difficult to persuade farmers that they should invest in yesterday's machine. One of these manufacturers H. Stolzenberg lodged an objection to the tariff concession and so it was refused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 26 October 1993, the industry lodged a new application with the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce for a concessional entry of these machines under item No. 46, new technology. By 20 January this year, the industry had not received a reply to its quite extensive application. So it made inquiries with the department only to be told that it had not even been looked at three months after the application had been lodged and that it would be another two months before any bureaucrat got around to opening the file. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is simply not good enough. I wrote to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Senator Cook) complaining that the industry would have to wait five months before the application would even be considered, let alone have the merits of the particular case looked at. I complained to Senator Cook. I got a reply on 21 February telling me that he regretted it but, unfortunately, he could do nothing to expedite the examination of the application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raised this matter because, with the size of our massive Public Service, it is simply not good enough that an industry has to wait five months to have its application even considered. I contrast this with the department's attitude to importing peanuts that are grown in other parts of the world. The department seems to have bent over backwards to allow the import of poor quality peanuts, which have flooded the domestic market and caused serious damage to the reputation of the industry. Some of these peanuts are of such poor quality and are so contaminated that Ian McFarlane, the President of the QGGA, commented recently that they `glow in the dark'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These peanuts are allowed in, seemingly without question and without delay. But when the industry wants to import new machinery to bring our industry up to world standard by using technology that is available to the rest of the world, its application is being held up for five months before it is even considered. It is not good enough for Senator Cook to sleep in around the world or here. He must get his department into gear so that it can consider these applications quickly. The peanut industry harvest will start within days. It must have an answer immediately. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise some concerns this evening with respect to several matters regarding multiculturalism in this country. The first of these is the welter of media reporting that occurred in the wake of the tragic bombing of the National Crime Authority office in Adelaide recently. We saw a veritable torrent of speculation about the alleged involvement of the Australian mafia and all sorts of possible speculation about mafia techniques and who might be involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this country we seem to have lost sight of basic principles of people being innocent until proven guilty. In this instance, in effect, an entire very substantial ethnic group in our society is being slurred by association. That slur is essentially based on little more than American gangster movies and a culture of, to some extent, fantasy that has developed over many years. Now that a person has been arrested for that outrageous crime, I would like to think that the media could restrain itself and deal with the issues based on substance, evidence and, ultimately, the proper workings of the courts and not allow an entire section of our community to be slurred by association. It may be a joke to some but it is extremely serious to people who have to put up with the implications that emerge from that. If a person has a certain name, lives in a certain area or is engaged in certain occupations, then people will naturally tend to draw those conclusions if this sort of stuff is fuelled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, comments have been made by a number of people about the Slav-Macedonian and Greek communities, particularly in Melbourne, and the very unfortunate violent incidents in recent times which, on their face, may be attributable to the issue that is currently in dispute. I refer particularly to comments by people suggesting that those who have perpetrated those crimes should go home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, many in our community forget that, in times past, Anglo-Australians had similar concerns about their home country to those of more recent migrants. For example, both my grandfathers fought in the First World War. One was an English migrant and the other was of Irish extraction born in Australia. They, like hundreds of thousands of other Australians, thought nothing about Australians going to fight in a European war in defence of what they saw as their homeland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, we should find it totally unsurprising that people now in the country who were either born overseas or who have left families in those countries should be very strongly concerned about what is going on in those countries, and what is happening to the people in their country of origin and in their homeland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of these statements disturb me because they tend to imply different levels of political violence&mdash;that in some way political violence perpetrated by people of a particular ethnic background could be connected with disputes overseas is perhaps more reprehensible than what might be described as domestic political violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, along with I am sure all other honourable members of this House, would condemn all political violence absolutely. It is not particularly appropriate to draw those distinctions and to say that if such violence is going on it is in some way more reprehensible if it is related to some issue going on overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I state unequivocally that people are welcome here and they are welcome to debate issues relating to their countries of origin. They are welcome to peacefully demonstrate about those issues. They are welcome to put their views to government forcefully. They are no more welcome to engage in acts of violence related to those issues than are people born in Australia or people who have been in Australia longer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I express concern about the apparent resurgence of political organisations explicitly focused on preventing any further immigration to Australia. I note with some concern that one of my colleagues actually supports such an organisation in a by-election that is coming up shortly and I wish to dissociate myself from that. I find that very unfortunate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally speaking, I attend many functions of many ethnic communities, often with a representative of the opposition. Virtually without exception people of both political parties support multiculturalism and support the diverse Australia that we have become. Therefore, I urge the opposition to apply the same approach that I have just applied with respect to somebody on our side. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is something rotten in SBS radio land. According to the Special Broadcasting Services Act, amongst other things the SBS charter says that, in performing its principal function, the SBS must:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) make use of Australia's diverse creative resources; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(g) contribute to the overall diversity of Australian television and radio services,</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, we recently had evidence of a vast concentration of resources in SBS radio Sydney to the detriment of Melbourne which also services Adelaide, Perth and Hobart. The SBS television management is in Artarmon in Sydney and radio management is also in Sydney, so that Melbourne now has very little opportunity to participate in management decisions. Of the 42 senior positions, four are held by people who live and operate out of SBS Melbourne and 38 are held by people who live and operate out of Sydney. The irony is the fact that the non-English speaking background ethnic population is larger in Victoria than in Sydney. That is a fact. Melbourne is being denied the services of people who know the issues of their own ethnic populations and their participation in management decisions. I note that the annual report of the SBS said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the fourth year in a row, SBS Radio Melbourne was awarded media recognition by the Australia Day Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That has not happened with SBS Sydney. Why not? I believe it is about the fourth time that Melbourne has won an award. Equity clearly demands that these diverse groups should be adequately represented in decision-making processes. Yesterday in question time I asked the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) a question in essence about SBS management and whether he believed that it was equitable to concentrate all the management in Sydney. In his answer he said, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SBS suffers from the great disadvantage that it was set up during the period of a Liberal government.</PARA>
<PARA>What a ridiculous statement for a minister to make. Honest to goodness, that is a slap in the face to all those ethnic Australians, regardless of what city or state they live in. It is wrong to say that a political party, regardless of which political party it was, set up SBS radio and has done badly by the ethnic community because of it. `What an absolute disgrace', they say. The minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have to apologise to the honourable member&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>me&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">for the fact that SBS does not have infinite resources that allows it to have offices in every capital city equal to those in Artarmon.</PARA>
<PARA>He is a pretty sarcastic minister, too, is he not? He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SBS's obligation is to use the resources that it has to provide the excellent service it does in a way that uses its funds responsibly&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and note that word `responsibly'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and efficiently.</PARA>
<PARA>I have to say to the minister that in exercising his responsibility it would be responsible to give Melbourne a fair go. If SBS TV management is going to be in Sydney, fair enough, but how about putting the radio management in Melbourne? That would make a little bit of sense with regard to equity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increasing centralisation in Sydney means that Sydney's newsroom is staffed full time, with nine journalists, and Melbourne's is only staffed part time, with two journalists. There is a real running battle between staff in Sydney and Melbourne; there are bad feelings and it is not contributing to SBS aims. SBS broadcasters and journalists in Melbourne have strong links with the communities that they represent and those links should be used to the benefit of all the ethnic groups that want to participate in this fine service provided by SBS radio. I call on the minister to straighten this mess out and give us a bit of equity. </PARA>

I am really excited about the possibility of having a centre with some paid staff, though mostly manned by volunteers, linking into the legal services that may provide a service gratis, but particularly linking into the great law schools in Sydney and perhaps final year students. The possibilities of this are unlimited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My dilemma is that we have called a public meeting on Saturday. I have written to over 13,000 people because the community needs to be consulted and to approve it. The community has to have its stamp on it, rather than individual committee members. The meeting is to be held in the polyclinic. The polyclinic was built by Gough Whitlam's government&mdash;because we could not get a hospital we got a polyclinic. The problem is that to get the polyclinic for this public meeting for consultation with the public, we were told that we had to sign a contract with a public liability clause. Here we have a state Minister for Health, Ron Phillips, and a state department of health in a public building demanding of unincorporated and incorporated community organisations that in order to use a public building they must sign a public liability clause, presumably for negligence that may arise out of their operation of the centre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We rang the minister's office about two weeks ago and we were redirected to the department. The department consulted its solicitors and said that we must sign. Solicitors on our committee said we would be fools to sign. So this afternoon I contacted the minister's office again and said, `This is absolutely crazy. What do you have public buildings for if not to have the public use them?'. What better purpose could there be than to have a public meeting to set up a Mount Druitt community legal information and support centre and have people there? Mr Fahey recently said that he is going to appoint a minister for red tape. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about Ron Phillips, the Minister for Health, cutting through a bit of red tape in his own flaming department and saying, `A federally funded building should allow the public to meet there and without these ridiculous clauses'. If he is incapable of cutting through this ridiculous red tape, let him resign. If he will not resign, let the Premier, in the first implementation of his lust and thrust to cut through red tape, cut through Ron Phillips&mdash;sack him, replace him, and put in a minister for health who feels some accountability and some responsibility to the public and who is not there as a puppet to dance to the tune of the bureaucrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the minister will take action tomorrow. If not, am I to cancel the meeting? I cannot write to 13,000 people in two days and say, `The Minister for Health won't let us use the building. Sorry. Don't turn up because we are not going to sign a clause that we have been advised not to sign'. What does he expect me to do? What does he expect the committee members to do? The committee is made up of most of the leading people in our area, and they are very concerned. They include my political friends, community leaders, ministers of religion&mdash;you name them; they are on the committee. All we want to do is consult with the public.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Council of Australian Governments, at its February 1994 meeting, agreed that the Trade Practices Commission and the Prices Surveillance Authority be merged to form an Australian Competition Commission. This decision was based on the Report of the National Competition Policy Review and was part of a broader decision to implement a national competition policy, with the Council to consider detailed legislation to implement such a policy at its next meeting in August 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Competition Commission is an essential element of a national competition policy framework that will improve Australia's international competitiveness, living standards, and capacity to create new employment opportunities. It will also assist in the vital tasks of improving productivity and of fostering innovation in a way that results in sustainable economic growth for the benefit of all Australians.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mutual Recognition was not discussed by the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) at its February 1994 meeting. COAG did, however, note a report by the Commonwealth-State Committee on Regulatory Reform which included a brief progress report on the operation of the Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA). The Committee considered that the MRA has been operating successfully to date. COAG has called for reports on some further refinements to the scheme's operation to be prepared for its August 1994 meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The substance of the Agreement and its associated legislation provides for the free movement of goods and the recognition of occupational registration between Australian States and Territories regardless of regulatory variations existing between jurisdictions. The MRA has significantly reduced barriers to trade within Australia and represents a major step forward in the development of a national market. The MRA has also led to benefits to business, in terms of lower costs from not having to comply with the regulatory requirements of up to eight separate jurisdictions; to consumers, who now have access to a greater choice of goods; and to employees, by facilitating inter-jurisdictional workforce mobility.</PARA>
