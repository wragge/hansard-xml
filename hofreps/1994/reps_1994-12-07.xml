<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a very good chance of that. That will be the third interest rate rise we have had in recent times. We have already had an increase of 1 3/4 per cent, and I wonder what we can expect to see as a result of today's Reserve Bank meeting. There are a lot of concerns in this country about the economy and one would think, from watching the government's performance, that everything was rosy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the government that increases in interest rates affect average families. They affect the mums and dads. They affect not only rich people, but all people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Mitchell says it is about $35; perhaps it is even more than that. The point is that this is an expense for average people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is looking at ways to reduce its deficit. We are yet to see how it is going to go about doing that. It could take a responsible course, one that we have been advocating: it could look carefully at reducing government expenditure. I do not pretend that that is easy. We do not believe that that is an easy proposition at all. There are lots of calls on government expenditure; nevertheless, reducing government expenditure is a responsible way forward to attack the budget deficit. This government is clearly a tax and spend government. Therefore, the option least attractive to it will be to look critically at government revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having avoided that, despite the calls for a deficit reduction strategy by the Governor of the Reserve Bank on a number of occasions, the government is now about to take the much easier option of increasing taxes. As we pointed out to the Prime Minister in question time on Monday, that is in the context of promises prior to the last election to not increase taxes. No matter how the Prime Minister might want to get around that and argue about the semantics of that, it was very clear to us&mdash;I think it was very clear to everyone in Australia&mdash;that, prior to the last election, the Prime Minister was saying that there would be no increases in taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's whole election strategy was based on criticism of our proposal to bring in what ultimately would have been a much fairer, more efficient and more equitable tax system. The government's whole election strategy was an attack on us. The government went to the extreme of bringing legislation into this parliament which was aimed at convincing the Australian people that its strategy was to match our proposal to reduce income tax. So we had the famous l-a-w tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite what the Prime Minister said in question time on Monday, the government has reneged on that promise. It has repealed that legislation. The second stage of those income tax reductions is now not to be delivered until some time in 1998, which is a long way down the track. There is no doubt at all in my mind that the tax cuts will disappear completely off the agenda long before that. Rather than have further decreases in income tax, we will see increases in taxes and charges. The opposition is now totally aware, and the Australian people should be aware, that the problem of how to raise more revenue for the purposes of doing what needs to be done&mdash;reducing the deficit&mdash;is very much on the government's agenda. The government's current substantial deficit is the result of its high spending policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Almost every day in this place a minister comes in here with a new spending initiative, a new program or a new paper of some sort that foreshadows spending. In the end, that is the only thing this government knows how to do&mdash;spend other people's money. Much of this money is wasted. Much of it is to solve problems that the government has created in the first place. Its strategy for reducing unemployment is largely based on throwing money at the problem rather than carrying out the fundamental reforms in the economy, which would lead to real job creation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not a difficult proposition. We on this side of the House understand clearly that to create real jobs we need to make it possible for businesses to employ more people. That is a simple proposition. But rather than go down the track of proper micro-economic reform and proper reform of the industrial relations system, which this government cannot do because it is bound to the rules set up by the unions&mdash;it is governed by the unions&mdash;it comes in here with all sorts of other panaceas, such as training programs and subsidies to employers. Everything is done back to front. The government always puts the cart in front of the horse rather than coming up with real and, in the end, simpler solutions to the problems of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not talk about increasing taxes, which the government is talking about, to solve the problem. Ironically, the solution to the problem is to reduce taxes and charges. In reducing taxes and charges, particularly on small business, employment will be stimulated. There are about one million small businesses in Australia. It does not take too much imagination to realise that if each of those small businesses employed one more person there would be a significant impact on the number of unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I go out to my electorate, as I have recently done, and visit small businesses, look at what they are doing and talk to them about their problems, one of the problems they raise consistently is the need to get trained staff. They have certainly been let down on that score, with the very low number of apprentices currently being trained. There is a lack of trained staff and a lack of staff who are prepared to work hard. Small business people in my electorate consistently tell me that they would employ one, two, three, four or five more people tomorrow if they could get people who were genuine about seeking work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has created a system whereby people can actually choose whether to work or not. Despite its attempts in recent times to address the issue of the unemployment benefit being too generous, once again in a bandaid fashion it has simply tinkered at the edges making it possible for people to actually retain their unemployment benefit at the same time as doing some work. Employers in my electorate tell me that people are still saying to them, `I'm sorry. I really think there are some benefits for me in getting back into the work force, but, unfortunately, I can get as much in benefits from the government by the time I add them all up, having three or four children, as the wage you are offering me, even if it is the award wage'&mdash;and let us assume that those wages in many respects are very generous&mdash;`and it really is not worth my while coming to work for you.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alternatively, I am being told that people are saying, `I'm getting the unemployment benefit and you have got a desperate need for my particular trade, so I will come and work for you if you just give me a bit of cash or whatever on the side. As long as it does not interfere with my unemployment benefit, I am prepared to work for you.'</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FT4">Mr BRADFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not a myth. I am telling you that I have been out in my electorate in recent weeks and this is what is happening. The people on the other side of the House are totally deluded; they just do not exist in the real world. It is a pity that they do not, because if they went out and saw what was happening in the real world, they would be very concerned. The government's feeble attempts to solve the problems of this country are not going to work. We already see evidence, despite the assurances given yesterday by the Treasurer (Mr Willis), that we will be back on a boom-bust cycle. The government has already lost control of the economy and that will become evident before very long.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government needs to be reminded&mdash;and I take the opportunity in the context of this debate about government expenditure&mdash;that the solution to this country's problems is not to talk about increasing taxes, but rather decreasing taxes. In the context of decreasing taxes, rather than talking about spending money, it ought to be looking seriously at saving money and looking at many of the programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is almost impossible for a member of parliament who has been here for five years&mdash;let alone for the average person in the street who is subjected to all sorts of propositions by the Department of Social Security or the Commonwealth Employment Service&mdash;to understand the complexity of so many of the programs that it has brought in. There is such a diversity of programs&mdash;the government is putting money into this and money into that&mdash;yet the solutions to the huge problems of our overseas debt and the level of unemployment that persists in this country are much simpler. They do not relate to spending money; they actually relate to doing exactly the opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The solution I advocate as far as deficit reduction is concerned is to look critically at what the government is actually spending. Ironically, in doing that to reduce taxes it will have the effect of encouraging businesses to employ more people and there will be increased revenue to the government by virtue of the dividend that will flow from that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very concerned about the prospect of increasing interest rates. I think we are all waiting to see what the result of the meeting this morning will be. We already have very high interest rates in this country. From that base, we are about to step off further onto the treadmill which we have been on before. The Australian people remember very well the promises we have had in the past&mdash;in 1985 and beyond. We have experienced this situation before. We were told that everything was under control. We were told budget after budget that everything was fine, that we were going along well, then we had the worst recession in 60 years. We are about to get back on that same track, that same treadmill, that will take us in that same direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me remind the House of the impact higher interest rates will have not only on families but also on small business. Many small businesses went broke during the last recession because of not only reduced demand for their products but, initially and subsequently, higher interest rates. Most small businesses rely, to a very large extent, on borrowing money for one purpose or another. They have overdrafts, short-term loans and longer term financing, but they are affected by increasing interest rates. As interest rates escalated rapidly, as they did in the late 1980s and early 1990s, many of them went broke. The effect of that was unemployment. I am very concerned about the prospect of increasing interest rates that we now have on the agenda for this country. Frankly, I do not accept the assurances of the Treasurer that the government has the economy under control. The fact is, and certainly even the government's own advice appears to have been, that it lost control of the economy very early on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of this debate, I want to place on record my dismay at the way this government is managing the economy; in fact, it is mismanaging the economy. It has created a welfare system in this country that has pervaded almost the whole of our society. I wonder at times whether that is intentional. It is almost a new form of socialism that has been thrust upon us, a form of socialism that is not as obvious as earlier forms. Yet 4.4 million people in this country are now totally dependent on this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the early 1970s around 10 per cent of people were dependent on government for their primary source of income. The figure today is closer to 27 per cent or 28 per cent. That represents an enormous cost to government and it ought to be of great concern to people that that is the trend. Average families that previously were not in the government welfare net now find themselves there by virtue of the home child-care allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We previously received the dependent spouse rebate through the tax system. It worked very efficiently but the government, for the purpose of another of its agendas&mdash;that is, political correctness&mdash;decided that sent out the wrong signals. Hundreds of thousands of people who were never involved with the Department of Social Security before went through the intrusive process of having the Department of Social Security write to them and ask all sorts of questions that were never relevant to the tax office in getting the dependent spouse rebate. That was available to people by a very simple mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now find ourselves&mdash;I say `we' because my family is included&mdash;in the Department of Social Security computer system. We are now numbers in the Department of Social Security. We never wanted to be involved with the Department of Social Security. We were perfectly happy with the arrangements before with the dependent spouse rebate. Now we get $30 a week. I worked out the other day that we end up with $10 a month more than we used to get. I am paying for it because my tax has been increased as a result of my losing the dependent spouse rebate. Each month I get less money. My wife gets it back the same month via the tax office and the Department of Social Security. We can only imagine how many extra public servants have had to be employed in the Department of Social Security to manage that new system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that we are heading down the road towards the next election with the government in complete disarray, as far as concerns its management of the economy and its whole range of policies. I believe that the Australian people will wake up to the fact they have been conned in many respects, that they have been misled. The irony of this is that they have experienced all of this before. We intend to remind the Australian people, and the government, as we head down the track toward the next election, that this Prime Minister was the Treasurer who consistently told us, in all of those years through the 1980s and early 1990s, that we were on track, that everything was under control. We knew then that it was not, we know now that it is not, and we intend to remind the people of Australia about that every day between now and the next election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intend to take this opportunity in the debate on the appropriation bills to raise a matter which I think is very important but is being disregarded in Australia. Listening to the last speaker, the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), I must say that it is heartening to know there are some things that are bipartisan in this parliament&mdash;and, clearly, massive ignorance is one of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are being told that the future of Australia and of the world lies in some great El Dorado of free trade. This has always been, basically, the policy of the Liberal Party. With my own party it has not been so, but in recent times we too have embraced this sterile ideology. I think we need to look very hard at what this policy offers us. In my view, the policy is dead wrong and dangerous for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told by Minister McMullan&mdash;in fact, by the World Bank&mdash;that implementing the full GATT agreement would increase world trade by $213 billion in the next 10 years. That is a lot of money. But we really have to analyse that against what world trade would be if we did not have GATT. If we did that analysis, we would find that the world trade figures would be about the same. Furthermore, $213 billion is 0.7 per cent of world trade. It is not a very significant amount, but its redistribution could have catastrophic consequences. The Secretary-General of the OECD admits that the figures are highly theoretical and also theatrical. I think it does give us cause for real concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told that cheap goods produced by low cost labour overseas will be good for consumers. What governments and oppositions tend to forget is that consumers are workers also. There is absolutely no doubt that, if we are to govern for the benefit of the people of this country, Australia must be a high wage country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no future in going down the low wage route. For one thing, there is simply no end to it. If overnight we were to cut a full 33 per cent off the cost of employing labour in Australia, it would simply mean that our competitors would be able to employ something like 30 cheap labour workers, say, Filipinos or Vietnamese, instead of the 40 or 45 workers they do employ now. If we analyse these figures, we can see it is a very dangerous and foolish road for Australia to go down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we could also ask ourselves: do we, as a developed country, have any moral responsibility to open our markets to Third World countries? I would argue that we do not. I would also say that, if a country by good luck or good management is able to obtain for its citizens a high standard of living with good services and a good quality of life, there is absolutely no justification for that country to sacrifice those things on the altar of some altruistic view that we have to help other people. If we go down that road, we will find it is endless also: those countries will not reciprocate; they will simply bypass us and leave us for dead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I drove back from Parkes this morning. I took my son down there last night because he is going to work in Parkes for a company called Austops. Austops is a very interesting company. It produces the highest quality and the cheapest wool tops in the world. We in Australia are unbeatable in this field, if we do it right. We sell our tops in a completely unprotected market. It has always been that way and, as far as I can see, it always will. Free trade does nothing for this industry. It is already there and we are already highly competitive. We should have 30 of these Austops factories throughout Australia turning the great bulk of our wool into top making value adding in Australia thereby increasing the wealth of this nation and providing much needed jobs in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We export our minerals into a world where we have no protection whatsoever. We do very well because we are the best miners in the world. Free trade is not going to assist these industries greatly. Some people from AMIC and some of those whom I call the lead-brained people in the mining industry have said that the access to imports is not going to be of great benefit to them because they can get most of the stuff they use now tariff-free anyway. So there is no great benefit there. They do not face the problem of high labour costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that Australian labour is expensive in the mining industry but it is also highly productive. The problems this industry faces include access to land. What is going to cripple the mining industry&mdash;the industry that is so vital to Australia because of its export earning capacity&mdash;is access to land and the increasing sovereign risk that comes with it. There is no guarantee that free trade in the world is going to be a bonanza for us. There is a lot of evidence to suggest that quite the contrary will happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look for a moment at Third World countries. If we were to suddenly subject all Third World countries to best practice in agriculture, it would have catastrophic effects. If their agriculture is measured in terms of the number of people required to grow a given quantity of food, it is generally not particularly efficient but it does employ an enormous number of people. If competitive pressures are put in there, those countries will be forced to modernise their agriculture, to go into broadacre agriculture and to lower their costs of production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequence of that will be massive unemployment in those countries: while wages are low in the rural sector in Third World countries, it at least gives people employment and access to food. Then there would be a massive transfer of people from rural areas of the Third World to the already overcrowded cities. The consequence of that would be a push for mass movement of people, mass immigration, which would be impossible to resist. Is this the future that governments and oppositions see for Australia? It is certainly not the future that I want for my children in this nation. Furthermore, we should ask: is it what we want for Third World countries? I am sure that, if they thought about it, it would not be something they would want for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We really have to rethink this issue. Basically, by executive decree, we in the Australian Labor Party have gone down the free trade route. The Liberal Party has no mind; it is simply an amorphous mass. It has this ideological predilection for free trade. It has never bothered to think about the consequences. When people in the opposition prattle on about micro-economic reform, inevitably they mean lower wages. Micro-economic reform is a code word in this nation for lowering wages, it is not the way to go for Australia. I believe there is more to be gained from a study of history than there is from a study of economics. In history, you can see the end product of where the economic actions have taken us in the past. We live in a world in which there has been a revolution in the vocabulary. Words do not mean what they used to mean anymore. When we talk about rational economists nowadays, what we really mean is neoclassical economists. There is nothing particularly rational about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the United States, arguably the most powerful economy in the world&mdash;or it was until 1983, when the United States decided to declare class war on its own people. We have seen a reduction in real average wages in the United States. It does not mean everyone is getting less; some people are getting a lot more. But the United States is busily building itself an underclass of its own citizens. That is certainly not the future I want for Australia. I want a much more egalitarian society in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United States is saying that its salvation lies in free world trade. It wants access to Japanese markets. The reality is that, if Japan were to wipe away all forms of protection tomorrow, it would probably lead to $10 billion a year extra trade for the United States. The reality is that the United States does not need $10 billion a year&mdash;it needs $300 billion a year&mdash;to redress the damage that it has done to its economy. It is absolutely a nonsense concept. The historical evidence demonstrates this, yet we still go mindlessly down this road. We in the Labor Party are driven by the executive, and the people in the Liberal Party follow like the mindless sheep that they are. I believe this free trade business has to be thrashed out in much more detail. We have to have this argument in the Australian parliament before we go too far down this road. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have absolutely no problems with trade, but there is a great need for self-sufficiency in countries. We are told by the rational economists that countries should specialise&mdash;a policy which the French reject totally. I believe the management of the French economy has a lot of merit. I do not believe that we should be a totally specialist country, because it will leave us extremely dependent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have mentioned in the parliament before, in August last year we lost in Australia our last capacity to cast truck wheels. I would have thought truck wheels would have been absolutely vital to transport, on which the whole economy and the defence of this country balance. That company closed down because it could not compete against truck wheels imported from Malaysia. Within a very short period of that Australian company closing down, the price of Malaysian truck wheels went up in Australia to a level higher than had prevailed before the closure of the Australian company. It is clear and rational that this is what will happen if we are silly enough to allow it to happen, yet we go on saying that this is good for us. Obviously, it is not. It is simply a revolution in the meaning of words. `Yes' means `no', `black' means `white', and `rational' means `irrational'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe it is all gloom. I believe Australia can have an enormous future, but we must tackle it on a simple, commonsense basis. The best welfare system in the world is a job. It should be a job that is interesting, offers advancement to a person and offers good remuneration. But, at the end of the day, a job is very important. We are being told&mdash;it is no doubt true and it is in a sense a great tribute to this government&mdash;that we have increased the export of elaborately transformed manufactured goods by a compound rate of about 10 per cent a year since we have been in government. That is a very commendable effort indeed. The problem is that the importation of that same category of goods has risen by a slightly higher amount from a much bigger base. So the gap is getting bigger, not smaller. That means that there are fewer jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that Australia has been good at traditionally is precision engineering and work in the metal trades, yet we see metal workshops closing up all over South Australia and to some extent in Victoria. The economy of South Australia is manufacturing industry based and, without that industry, there is no future for South Australia. It is simply a cruel lie and a hoax to keep telling the people of that state that their future lies in tourism or free trade. It clearly does not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is well worth looking at the United States because it became the world's powerhouse. No country could compete with it in export manufactures. That was at a time when the United States had a very high import duty. It was internally competitive, but it was largely protected against imports. It was from this base that it was able to develop its industries and export to the world. How things have changed and how unnecessary it is for that to be the case. The reality in Australia is that we are not going to reduce the current account deficit unless we address the issue of import replacement manufacturing. This is where the jobs are and this is where the big savings in the current account are. Are we doing this? The answer, quite clearly, is no, we are not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a simple rule in economics that goes something like this: if we join together two countries of equal size and make them a common market union, there will be no effect on wages because they are of equal size and equal standard to start off. If, however, we join together two countries of equal size which have very dissimilar standards of living, over 15 years those standards of living will equalise. In the case of the United States and Canada, which are roughly equal, joining with Mexico, which has a lower population, we would see a decrease in the standard of living in the United States. I believe the United States will find this decrease intolerable, but it will not be great because of the relatively small population in Mexico. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must also look at maximising the potential of these industries. The reality is that we cannot value add the mining industry. Our customers in Asia want to value add because they realise that is where the jobs are. They are not stupid. It is obvious that jobs are in value adding. What we have to do with the mining industry is to value add the front end. We have to start manufacturing the mining equipment in Australia. In Australia we have some of the largest mining operations in the world, we have state-of-the-art miners, the highest standard, world best practice, miners. Why do we not have an industry? Because there is another vital element: government support. It does not mean government investment, it just means government rapport. </PARA>

The minister's assurance was the driving force behind the establishment of Austops. Mr Todhunter has told me that absolutely explicitly on several occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not have that government support with the mining industry. The government should be saying to industry, `Hey, we want you to get in there. We want a mining industry and it is not happening.' That is why we do not have that industry in Australia. Honourable members should bear one simple fact in mind. A large Haulpak, trucks used in the mines to carry large tonnages of ore, is anything over 200 tonnes. Australia uses 70 per cent of the world's Haulpaks yet we do not make one in Australia. I believe that is a national scandal.

We do need the press gallery to take up the issue of this ridiculous free trade position that has been trotted out in this federal parliament. Following the Wills by-election in April 1992&mdash;an election which focused on the nexus between tariff reductions and the loss of jobs in the manufacturing sector, and which brought to public scrutiny the fantasy of the level playing field&mdash;the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was reborn as a protectionist, lampooning the coalition for its so-called zero tariff policy. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all surely remember the Prime Minister pointing the finger at the then Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), catapulting the derisive `Captain Zero' into the political lexicon. The fact that the Prime Minister was an unashamed, unreconstructed free trader&mdash;only marginally or five per cent different from the member for Wentworth&mdash;was lost in the banter. Unfortunately, what continues to be overlooked in the debate is that tariffs are not in themselves the issue but merely a symbol of the problem. In essence, a commitment to tariffs, or non-tariff barriers for that matter, is predicated on the belief that economic sovereignty is essential to any meaningful definition of nationhood&mdash;hardly a reactionary or inward-looking view.</PARA></TALK.START>

It matters not to the Prime Minister or the Minister for Communications and the Arts who controls, produces and disseminates that which they define as culture.

Smythe asks rhetorically, `Will Australia's sporting and cultural heritage be ultimately wiped out by the unstoppable force of modern American marketing?' If last night is any indication, I would say regrettably the answer is `yes'. </PARA>

Their contempt for the kitsch culture of Hollywood and their preparedness to restrict Hollywood's attempt to dump mass-produced rubbish in their market are some of their more commendable practices. Why, we must ask, does this parliament speak the language of national sovereignty yet accept policies which produce economic and political dependence? Dr Joe Camilleri, in an article `Music of the Sphere' in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Arena</EMPHASIS> magazine of October-November 1994, describes the trend this way:</PARA>

They do not regard the World Trade Organisation, APEC, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund as international institutions to worry about.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Camilleri's scenario that `a largely deregulated financial system effectively removes major levers of economic policy such as exchange and interest rates from national control and opens the way for unproductive investment and large and unpredictable financial flows' would be music to the ears of the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore). When the financial markets prevailed and the 10-year bond rate `went gangbusters', to use the Prime Minister's language, he attacked the messenger boys&mdash;those mobile phone-toting, BMW-driving yuppies who gather on the floor of the Australian Stock Exchange and scour terminals looking for a quick buck. What he did not want to acknowledge was that his policies were the reason these charlatans had become so powerful and the nation state so powerless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we all know, the unpredictable financial flows that Camilleri refers to were the source of the kinds of speculative ventures which devastated Australia in the 1980s.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In stark contrast to the ideologically loaded and empirically distorted accounts of East Asian industrialisation that have emerged from the pens and word processors of neo-classical economists . . . it is now clear that though these economies have benefited from vigorously functioning markets, state orchestration of their development projects has been a sine qua non of their success.</PARA>
<PARA>Henderson goes on to say of the east Asian NICs:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They have at various moments acquired foreign technology under license for dissemination to favoured companies, encouraged joint-venture arrangements with foreign partners, protected the domestic market from foreign competition, delivered subsidised credit through nationalised or heavily regulated banking systems (Korea and Taiwan) for approved projects and invested in their own R&amp;D facilities to help boost the technological capabilities of the private-sector manufacturers.</PARA>
<PARA>The approach of the Asian tigers to economic matters is a far cry from the silly, ill-conceived approach endorsed in this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister, in his APEC statement to the parliament yesterday, cheerfully reminded us that our tariffs are among the lowest in the region and that Australian industry has shown it is more than capable of competing in a low tariff environment. It is absolutely absurd to talk of Australia competing in a low tariff environment when the very countries against which we compete are proponents of high tariffs. Some APEC economies, the Prime Minister tells us, have tariffs ranging from 100 to 300 per cent. Is the Prime Minister actually aware of the unemployment that exists in parts of the northern suburbs of Melbourne, where the textile industry has been ravaged by the excesses of free trade?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has come to sound like a financial shark or con man. He tells us that, under APEC free trade, Australia's real output will rise by 3.8 per cent and real national income by 1.2 per cent and that exports will increase by 27 per cent and imports by 20 per cent. This runs totally counter to the thoughtful intellectual assessment of APEC provided by American academic Chalmers Johnson, who was in Australia recently to deliver a seminar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Johnson's approach is far more cautionary. He sees the United States of America and Japan as the big players. No-one in this House would be surprised to hear that the highly in-deficit USA wants a share of the highly in-surplus Japanese market. Nor should we be surprised to hear that Japan and China are unlikely to countenance trade policies which jeopardise their position. As Kenneth Davidson argues in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on 16 November 1994, `Even in sport&mdash;let alone industry, culture or politics&mdash;how often has the winner changed the rules of the game to give the loser a chance?' Davidson further says, `Instead of looking for rules, Australia has got to look at how it can manage our industrial development so that it's consistent with Australian and Asian needs.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For once the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) is right. Yes, the Prime Minister's speech is short on realism and short on detail. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition has no solutions of his own. All he does is reel out the standard right wing cliches: `lack of macro-economic reform', which should read `taxes are too high for business'; `labour market inflexibility', which should read `real wages are too high'. The problem is that his party is just as committed to simplistic forms of free trade as the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bipartisan commitment of the Labor and Liberal parties to radical tariff reduction means that we have no bargaining chips when it comes to the question of market access. As the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) so blithely reminds us, we have already undertaken tariff reduction. Like the Prime Minister, the member for Werriwa is big on rhetoric, generalisation and wishful thinking. If I had a dollar for every time he used the term `Australia is perfectly placed', I would be able to buy a house as big as the Prime Minister's. At what point does `perfectly placed' translate into economic and trade outcomes?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the member for Werriwa to claim that Australia was inward looking, as if the Asian tigers were not, and that our problems were essentially psychological is a complete falsification of history. Locking out cheap labour, for example, whether it be cheap Asian or white scab labour, should not be scoffed at by representatives of Labor. What was the capitalist class doing last century when it was trying to import cheap labour? Was it doing this altruistically to help the working class? I suggest that the member for Werriwa run this piece of revisionist history past the ACTU, including the Ferguson brothers and Bill Kelty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is the member for Werriwa suggesting that a free movement of labour of the kind Brian Toohey suggests in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 1 December might be the next step in the logic of market liberalisation? Why not? If, as the member for Werriwa tells us, mobile capital is the great liberator, then why not mobile labour? The member for Werriwa has surely read Monday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> and is therefore aware that 70 per cent of Indonesian workers are paid wages that barely meet their basic needs. They would be a good source of labour in Australia. A policy of mobile labour would, I am sure, be more than acceptable to the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How the member for Werriwa can describe Australia's tariff regime as being anti-Asian, when the Asian tigers themselves nurtured industry behind tariff and non-tariff barriers, is quite confounding. Even the Prime Minister acknowledges that Asian economies have been masterful at establishing trade barriers. Kenneth Davidson puts it rather nicely when he says, `Only a few idealogues really believe that the majority of the Dynamic Asian economies have any real commitment to free trade as the path to future economic development.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said on another occasion, the member for Werriwa could easily find a place on the coalition benches. It must surely tell the Australian public something about the state of thinking in the Labor Party.

We cannot even get it right over a 12-month period, so how can we possibly make statements with certainty over a 25-year period? <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the National Party just tells us that we should not be complacent.

<PARA>The evidence is there. The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) like many on his side of the House, blames the tax regime and the labour market for our economic problems. What they do not explain is where government will find the money to fund the kinds of outlays essential to a civilised society. As the member for O'Connor knows, and as the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) and the Treasurer (Mr Willis) are proud to announce, Australia's government outlays are amongst the lowest of OECD countries. Instead of harping about the oncosts experienced by business, we need to put industry policy, as the member for Kalgoorlie points out, seriously on the agenda, and it needs to be creative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sad reality is that the majority of members in the House have swallowed the free market, deregulation, level playing field lie hook, line and sinker. In November's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Arena</EMPHASIS> magazine, Steven Bell provides some figures which give another view of the so-called export revival that members of this House crow about. Bell reminds us that, although the automotive industry generated exports of $1.5 billion in 1993, automotive imports have risen from $4 billion in 1988 to $7.5 billion in 1993, and that the trade deficit in the automotive sector is running at over $6 billion per annum and rising. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some useful facts, many taken from Jenny Stewart's book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Lie of the Level Playing Field</EMPHASIS> are contained in Steven Bell's article. These include the fact that the overall share of the domestic market taken by manufactured imports has risen from 17 per cent in the late 1960s to 31 per cent in the 1990s; across 39 manufacturing industry sector categories, imports since the late 1960s have risen substantially in all but three of those categories; correspondingly, only eight categories increased export propensity by more than 10 per cent and only four of these categories were in higher value added areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is easy to play with figures; in fact, it is an art form in this House. It is always convenient to talk about a manufacturer here or a manufacturer there in someone's electorate who is doing great things. To focus on a small sample or a small number of success stories does not, as the previous figures show, tell the true story. Bell, like many others who are totally frustrated by our obsession with market liberalisation, argues for a serious industry policy&mdash;one which contains a supportive nexus between the state and market players, the kind that we have seen in Asia and France, the kind that proponents of market liberalisation fail to acknowledge when they contrast the economic development of Australia with that of the Asian economies. William Mitchell, in an article in the same magazine, produced a set of propositions concerning the distribution of wealth that has accompanied our pursuit of free market economies over the past decade.

In the bad old Liberal 1960s, the wages share averaged 56 per cent of GDP. Secondly, `The Accord has been extremely effective in reducing real wages and real labour unit costs and increasing profits.' It could have easily been designed by the coalition. Thirdly, `Between 1983 and 1993, executive salaries far outstripped non-managerial salaries.' But you will not find people in here attacking managerial salaries. They will be attacking the TWU when it tries to get a fair dinkum rise. Fourthly, `Public outlays due to tax concessions at the top end fell from 30 per cent of GDP in 1983 to 25 per cent in 1990 and in 1993 were around 28 per cent.' The government prides itself on its cuts to outlays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello)&mdash;today he is the deputy leader&mdash;has been calling for more cuts to outlays. If he wants the Prime Minister to give a commitment to no taxes, he should tell us what government expenditure he is going to cut. Fifthly, `Real wages cuts have not prompted investment in productive capital but rather in speculative ventures.' In the 1960s the investment to GDP ratio was over 26 per cent. In the 1990s it is around 21 per cent. Sixthly, `Australian investors significantly increased their stake in the rest of the world.' We might ask: what is wrong with Australia buying a bit of the world? Nothing if investment was at levels which provided full employment in Australia and if this investment managed to reduce foreign debt. The problem is that it did not.

In this House when we come to look at the economy and make an objective assessment of it, our views are often coloured by our political positions and perspectives. No economy in the world has been able to achieve the perfect scenario. Looking at the macro-economic settings, certain things typify the perfect economy. We would all like an economy that generates high rates of growth and has low unemployment rates. We would like an economy with low interest rates, low inflation, high levels of company profitability, high levels of industrial productivity, low debt levels, a current account that is in balance and low industrial disputation. If we put some of the more esoteric overlays on that, we could draw a picture of the perfect economy, or one that is in perfect balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest to the House and to the honourable member for Wills that no economy on the face of the earth meets all those criteria.

When you put all these factors together, the Australian economy over the past three decades has seen an improvement in its competitive position of about 30 per cent. That is not a mean achievement. It is certainly one that we on this side of the House are proud of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every economy has a downside. If we were to take an objective look at the Australian economy, the downside is the extent of the current account deficit and the continuing high levels of unemployment.

Productivity levels will be maintained. Our micro-economic reform program is continuing. Our access to the international marketplace has broadened with the conclusion of the GATT, and the APEC developments at Bogor in October certainly give us grounds for great optimism.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The average growth rate of the Australian economy over the life of this party in power has been 3.1 per cent. During the Fraser years, that is, the last time the Liberal-National party coalition occupied the Treasury bench, the growth rate was some 2 1/4 per cent. Our average growth rate to the June quarter for Australia was 4.3 per cent. If we look at the OECD, the other industrialised nations with which we compare ourselves, we see that their average rate of growth over the same period was 1.7 per cent. The OECD has made projections over the course of 1994. Of the 15 member countries, Australia is projected to grow at the highest level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Since Labor came to power in 1983 the Australian economy has expanded to provide some 1.5 million jobs. The average level of job creation over the period when Labor has been in office has been 150,000 jobs compared to the Fraser government's record of a dismal 37,000 jobs over a comparable period. If we look at a simple measure of economic performance such as inflation, we see that in the 12 months to June Australia's annual inflation rate was 1.7 per cent and the OECD average was 2.3 per cent. Since Labor has been in power&mdash;over the 1980s and into the 1990s&mdash;we have had an average inflation rate of five per cent, which contrasts with the coalition inflation rate of some 10.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rate of industrial disputation under Labor is three times less than when the coalition occupied the treasury bench. That paints a fairly favourable picture of the Australian economy. There are things that we, as a government, need to monitor closely over the next 12 to 18 months, such as wage outcomes, the way in which the deficit reduction strategy, put in place in 1993, is achieving the objectives set and the current account position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great successes of the government has been the way we have been able to produce wage outcomes that are consistent with low levels of inflation and high rates of growth in the Australian economy. The government has made it clear that wage rises must be linked to productivity gains at the enterprise level. The gains on the inflation front must be protected at all costs as well as our international competitive position. Our goal of keeping inflation between two to three per cent in coming years is achievable. Even the economic commentators agree with the government that it is a realistic target that can be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are seeing rising levels of real incomes in this country and that means rising standards of living for Australians. There are positives on the horizon as to our current account position. The world economies are set to grow in a simultaneous fashion, which will lead to greater demand for our manufactures and our commodities. That should see an improvement in commodity prices and an increase in returns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As sure as night turns to day, the drought will break and as farmers resume their historical levels of production that will give an enormous stimulus to domestic activity and our external account and we will see an improvement in the export of services. I read today that the number of international visitors coming to Australia is set to double and our exports of services are projected to grow from $16 billion to $30 billion by the turn of the century&mdash;a fairly substantial increase which should ease pressures on the current account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recent debate has focused on the fiscal position of the government, which has been able to achieve very good fiscal outcomes for this nation. Only one government in the past 30 years has been able to achieve the surplus and the budget deficit that we all desire: Labor in power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the opposition's economic policy. I am very interested in the area of industrial relations. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) is making a sprint for the leadership of the Liberal Party. We know how interested he is in industrial relations. The Liberal Party wants a totally deregulated labour market. That will lead to strong wages growth and allow those who have a powerful position in the industrial sector to use it to extract wage rises from the economy. If the Liberal Party were ever elected, there would be massive increases in industrial disputation, which would damage our international reputation. We will see a return to the penal sanctions that are typical of tory governments and that will replace the culture of cooperation which we have assiduously built up in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is little wonder that the opposition cannot develop a consistent economic policy, because it cannot even determine a leader. We on this side of the House are very astute observers of leadership changes and are all students of politics. I am very intrigued at the underlying principles that govern the selection of Liberal leaders. It is fairly obvious that one of the underlying principles is not talent, so we have to look elsewhere. I have come up with a theory of my own. To become a Liberal leader in the 1980s and 1990s the initial of your first name has to start with either A or J&mdash;Andrew, Alex, or John, John&mdash;or you must have recyclable characteristics. They are the two characteristics for Liberal leaders today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I went through the potential leaders in the Liberal Party on the conservative side to save the opposition the task of selecting their next leader. There is a field of nine potential candidates: the honourable members for Warringah (Mr Abbott), Wakefield (Mr Andrew), Bruce (Mr Beale), McPherson (Mr Bradford), Mitchell (Mr Cadman), Ryan (Mr Moore), Pearce (Mrs Moylan), Curtin (Mr Rocher) and Fairfax (Mr Somlyay). If you apply that criterion of A or J, any one of those nine could be leader. If you move that criterion to the back half of the alphabet to P, then the honourable members for Higgins (Mr Costello) and Flinders (Mr Reith) come into contention. There is a deadly double, if I ever saw one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), in recent times has come under increasing pressure over the leadership. I read the polls the other day. He has really joined the roaring 20s club, that elite band of Liberal leaders who have managed single handedly to drive their Newspoll approval rating below 30 per cent. The approval rating of the honourable member for Bennelong is 23 per cent, the former member for Kooyong, Andrew Peacock, 22 per cent and the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), 22 per cent. In the last poll, the approval rating of the honourable member for Mayo was 20 per cent. The only thing the honourable member for Bennelong and the honourable member for Mayo have in common is the fact that they have both polled in the Newspoll at around 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Mayo is the limbo king of the Newspoll. When we move the popularity stakes bar down he still manages to get under it. For us old time limbo dancers, it is really a question of: how low can he go? The honourable member for Bennelong is the man in contention at the moment. He is the friend of the tax bludgers in the 1970s and he is making a sprint for the Liberal leadership. He does not want to wield the knife; he wants to be drafted. He wants to go from being the little John of the 1970s to the big John of the 1990s.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What their major policy lines are is very unclear.

I think they're dreaming if they're serious in that thought that they have considered that I have heard expressed.</PARA>
<PARA>Here is a prominent business person saying that, if you want to go back down the time tunnel and if you want to bring back the honourable member for Bennelong, then you really have no future at all. It is really a statement about the state of the opposition.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to these appropriation bills now before the House, I intend to deal with several disturbing current national security issues about which the Australian people and parliament have a right to know. I will cover a range of issues relating to the management&mdash;or rather mismanagement&mdash;of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, ASIO. In no way am I concerned to criticise the many fine Australians who have worked for ASIO in various capacities and who have, with too little reward and recognition and at some degree of personal risk, served and continue to serve the interests of Australia. However, I am critical of ASIO senior management and the Director-General of ASIO, Mr David Sadleir, who is the wrong man in the wrong organisation at the wrong time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn firstly to the attack on the Iranian embassy in Canberra on 6 April 1992. This unprecedented attack on a foreign embassy in Canberra was a first-order intelligence failure by ASIO. According to the official report on the attack on the Iranian embassy, ASIO failed to provide a threat assessment concerning the Iranian embassy, despite the fact that nearly 20 premeditated attacks on Iranian embassies in 11 other capital cities were reported in news services prior to the attack on the Iranian embassy in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ASIO's responsibility for securing the embassy was discussed in its annual report to parliament of 1990-91, which referred to its role in warning `various agencies of protection and enforcement so that potentially threatening incidents can be forestalled'. The same report also claimed that `politically motivated violence dominated ASIO's operational and analytical work due to growing tension in more than one ethnic community over events in home countries'. In the event, the Australian government reportedly paid between $10 million and $12 million in compensation and increased embassy protection to the Iranian authorities. The ASIO budget should have borne that cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many unanswered questions concerning the attack on the Iranian embassy. The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has refused a formal request for an inquiry on the grounds that it is not his responsibility. It is the responsibility of the government, however, to reveal why there was, in the words of the Auditor-General's report No. 44 of 1993-94 into the electronic capture of passenger card data by the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, `an unprecedented computer breakdown' of DIEA's entry control system at a crucial time&mdash;six days after the attack on the Iranian embassy&mdash;when an entry control officer attempted to obtain a list of passengers to detain for questioning. Moreover, why did a senior audit officer suspect sabotage of DIEA's computer system by a foreign power?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The former Director-General of ASIO, Alan Wrigley, was publicly critical of ASIO's failure to warn of the attack on the Iranian embassy. Even the present Director-General, David Sadleir, appointed to the position of director-general shortly after the Iranian embassy fiasco, lamely admitted, `We'&mdash;that is ASIO&mdash;`have a bit of egg on our face.' It certainly did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members will be aware of the recent fire which burnt out the fourth floor of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade building which housed ASIS central office. It should be noted that ASIO is responsible for protective and physical security of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which it lists in its 1993-94 report as one of its major external clients. Yet a whispering campaign developed the theme that the fire was deliberately lit as ASIS had a vested interest in having its records destroyed. This claim was clearly intended to damage the reputation of ASIS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to another vital question: the internal security of ASIO. For ASIO, 1994 has been the year of the spy. The revelations concerning ASIO over the last two years, and in 1994 in particular, point to one irresistible conclusion: that the director-general should resign. In previous speeches in this House, in February and June this year, I pointed out that ASIO's efforts against the KGB and its successor&mdash;the Russian foreign intelligence service, the SVRR&mdash;had been compromised. Since that time, our security situation has deteriorated even further. ASIO has had to reconstruct its computer and telephone systems as they were believed to have been compromised by Soviet agents. Since that time, ASIO has reportedly replaced the system at an estimated cost of $7 million, although the precise cost is unknown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now wish to examine ASIO's counterintelligence record. It will not take long. ASIO's counterintelligence record&mdash;that is, the protection of ASIO against penetration by hostile or foreign intelligence services&mdash;can be summed up in one word: failure. Despite the director-general's description of himself in the press in August 1993 as the nation's `top spy catcher', ASIO has not uncovered a single KGB or SVRR agent by its own efforts. Every piece of information concerning the penetration of ASIO by the KGB or its successor, the SVRR, has been supplied by foreign intelligence services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February 1994, the government reluctantly and under pressure publicly revealed that the US Central Intelligence Agency had informed ASIO in late 1992 of the role of several Soviet intelligence officers in Australia. They were subsequently expelled from Australia. The government disclosure was made in February 1994 only after I had informed the House that several Russian intelligence officers had been expelled from Australia. Until that time, Senator Evans had been conducting his own unique form of communication with the Russian foreign minister and the head of the Russian foreign intelligence service, the SVRR, by secret letters&mdash;secret, that is, from scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In mid-1992, Senator Evans proposed to the Russian foreign minister, Andrei Kozyrev, that both Australia and Russia would agree not to post undeclared intelligence officers. By magic, apparently, espionage would cease. Not surprisingly, Mr Kozyrev did not even deign to reply to Senator Evans's letter. He probably viewed Senator Evans's proposal that spying should cease as a subtle, even practical, joke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In late June 1993, Senator Evans again wrote to Moscow. This letter was to Yevgenni Primakov, the head of the Russian foreign intelligence service. Evans informed Primakov that the expulsions of the Russian intelligence officers would take place in secret to minimise any damage to diplomatic relations between Australia and Russia. Primakov, a wily and former long-time KGB agent, laconically replied to Senator Evans that the expelled officers were `rogue elements' whose activities were not authorised by the Russian government. Senator Evans's credulous participation in such correspondence can, at best, be described as comic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a similar vein, at the height of the Petrov affair in 1955, Dr Evatt wrote to the Soviet foreign minister, Molotov, concerning the Petrov affair. Members on both sides of the House erupted into laughter when Evatt read the reply from Molotov, which not surprisingly agreed with Dr Evatt's assessment that, inter alia, the Petrov affair was designed to damage Soviet-Australian relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans should table his letters to the Russian foreign minister and Yevgenni Primakov and let honourable members judge for themselves the quality of his `secret writing'. Senator Evans and Mr Primakov knew that the six intelligence officers had been expelled. The Australian people and parliament were not told. One has to ask: why not? Does Senator Evans trust the head of the Russian foreign intelligence service more than this parliament and more than the Australian people?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the heart of the matter: the penetration of ASIO by the KGB and its successor, the SVRR. On this matter, the ABC is a far more reliable source of information than the government. We must thank the ABC for informing the Australian government and ASIO of yet another KGB mole in ASIO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 3 November 1994, the former KGB head of foreign counterintelligence, Major-General Oleg Kalugin, informed ABC viewers, and ASIO, that a KGB mole within ASIO had provided to the KGB `everything we wanted'. I quote Major-General Kalugin further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, as far as Australia was concerned I think we had everything we wanted.</PARA>
<PARA>He further pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the operation . . . developed into a major intelligence event in the Western intelligence community because Australia was and is part of this very tight secret brotherhood of the CIA, the British MI5 and the Canadians&mdash;and New Zealand of course. And for that reason, a penetration into the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation was a matter of priority.</PARA>
<PARA>According to Kalugin, the KGB mole inside ASIO:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . provided both intelligence and counter-intelligence and the quality of the information was top notch.</PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The information covered all aspects of security and intelligence organisations in Australia, partly of the United States and the United Kingdom.</PARA>
<PARA>Major-General Kalugin added:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There might have been more than just one person behind him because of the wide range of his access to the classified information.</PARA>
<PARA>Major-General Kalugin further stated that the KGB mole in ASIO was still active when he left the KGB in 1980 and:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . he had very good access and, in fact, he was considered one of the valuable assets of the Soviet intelligence.</PARA>
<PARA>In his memoirs, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The First Directorate</EMPHASIS>, published in November 1994, Kalugin claimed that a mole in ASIO had supplied the KGB with:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . extremely useful information about the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and its American and British partners . . .</PARA>
<PARA>In another section of his memoirs, he referred to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . our productive moles in Australian intelligence who passed us documents from the CIA and British intelligence . . .</PARA>
<PARA>We must also thank the ABC for publicising the fact that six Russian intelligence officers have recently arrived to replace the six officers expelled from Australia in 1993. In an interview on ABC radio on 15 November this year, Professor Desmond Ball of the Australian National University, who is an internationally recognised expert on Soviet intelligence and security and is better informed, frankly, than the government, stated that six Russian intelligence officers had recently settled in Australia to replace the officers expelled in 1993. Further, according to Professor Ball, the six Russian intelligence officers are performing the same espionage functions as the officers who were expelled in 1993. The Russian intelligence officers were all settled in Australia by mid-1994. Yet Senator Gareth Evans assured the media in February 1994 that the Russians had been purging agents from their embassies around the world. I emphasise that, in the period 1992-94, not one of the Russian intelligence officers or KGB or SVRR agents inside ASIO were discovered by ASIO. ASIO management has been asleep. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now wish to refer to the Australian Federal Police investigation into KGB-SVRR penetration of ASIO conducted in 1992 and 1993, called Operation Liver. Regrettably, a press campaign has begun to describe Operation Liver as a costly failure. However, this view is certainly not shared by Mr Gerard Walsh, the Deputy Director-General of ASIO. In a speech at a social but secret gathering of ASIO staff late last week, Mr Walsh claimed that Operation Liver was, in fact, highly successful. I will, of course, not disclose the entire contents of Mr Walsh's speech or where it was made. However, I can inform the House that Mr Walsh was so concerned at the morale of ASIO, at the extent of penetration of ASIO, that he requested staff to express the same spirit as that exhibited at the function to the task of assisting ASIO in detecting Soviet agents and not to allow personal loyalties to cloud their judgment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Walsh did not state&mdash;although he is no doubt aware&mdash;that ASIO's records were so inadequate that, in the course of Operation Liver, ASIO could not identify over 20 Soviet agents and assets, detected by the Federal Police, operating outside the Russian embassy, who had contacts with ASIO officers. Once again, these agents and assets had been detected by the Australian Federal Police and not by ASIO. The Federal Police took over the telephone interception of suspected ASIO officers, as ASIO lacked the equipment and resources. Over 40 telephone intercepts were conducted&mdash;an unprecedented number, which indicates the seriousness of the investigation. Additionally, four ASIO staff left ASIO without apparent loss of entitlements. Why? Because it could not be proved whether they were wittingly or unwittingly involved in ASIO's most serious scandal to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an extraordinary state of affairs. A key statutory responsibility of ASIO is to ascertain the security status of its own staff. The person responsible for ASIO is the Director-General, Mr David Sadlier. Mr Sadlier should resign. In calling for the resignation of Mr Sadlier as Director-General of ASIO, I am not reflecting on his loyalty to Australia but on his competence. Mr Sadlier is a competent diplomat; Mr Sadlier is an incompetent Director-General of ASIO. He does not have the temperament or training to be head of ASIO. He was appointed Director-General of ASIO to improve its relations with intelligence services in our region. Mr Sadlier does not know any Asian language; he is not an intelligence officer. Under Mr Sadlier, ASIO has veered from disaster to disaster. The government is well aware that ASIO morale is at an all-time low. For ASIO the game is up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should therefore give serious consideration to amalgamating most of the functions of ASIO with the Australian Federal Police&mdash;after, of course, the most vigorous vetting. It is my understanding that many ASIO staff would welcome amalgamation with the Federal Police. They realise that ASIO is no longer a viable organisation. They realise that ASIO is not held in high regard by the government or overseas intelligence organisations. They also realise that ASIO is beyond micro-level management reform, re-organisation or even the appointment of yet another new Director-General. Increasingly, even the government is conceding that, given the Iranian embassy fiasco and the cost of protracted investigations and inquiries into ASIO, ASIO is no longer cost effective. The government's continuing inquiries into ASIO are evidence of this belief. From 1987-88 to 1993-94, ASIO vetted over 109,000 Australians; only one adverse and nine qualified assessments were issued. These figures would be laughable, if the situation concerning the integrity and efficiency of ASIO were not so serious. They underline the point that even ASIO's vetting function has become obsolete. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matters I have raised today are too important to be whitewashed by the government. There are currently three security inquiries taking place: the inquiry of Mr Justice Samuels into ASIS; ASIO's own internal inquiry into Russian penetration; and the inquiry of Mr Michael Cook into national security and the penetration of ASIO. There is no valid reason why the major findings of these inquiries cannot be disclosed to this House and the Australian people; I call on the government to do so. </PARA>

This is not the cosmetic pretence at multicultural acceptance that the opposition offers. Our government has made a commitment to empowerment and equality, and it is serious about that commitment.

The Macarthur Migrant Resource Centre is located in the city of Campbelltown and also covers the Camden and Wollondilly local government areas. It services the federal electorates of both Macarthur and Werriwa. It also covers, amongst others, the two state electorates of Campbelltown and Camden.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week in the New South Wales parliament, the Minister for Multicultural and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Michael Photios, made a number of outrageous allegations in relation to the Macarthur Migrant Resource Centre. In response to a Dorothy Dix question from the state member for Camden, Dr Liz Kernohan, Mr Photios told the New South Wales parliament that the annual general meeting of the Migrant Resource Centre in Macarthur was the focus of a Labor inspired stacking exercise. He claimed that the Labor candidate for Camden, Mr Peter Primrose, and I conspired with a presumably large number of ALP members to try to overthrow the incumbent management committee. </PARA>

He alleged that Mr Primrose's campaign director, Mr Wayne Warton, had `orchestrated the whole affair', walking members into the meeting and `running the whole show on his mobile phone'. Mr Photios alleged that most of these people were members of the Camden branch of the ALP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I told this House on Monday in my personal explanation, these allegations are totally untrue and without foundation. They should be treated with the utter contempt that they deserve. However, I will take the time to refute these allegations in some detail because Mr Photios and Dr Kernohan have chosen to raise these completely baseless allegations under parliamentary privilege. That means that those people accused have no opportunity for legal action against those who would defame them and, apart from me and the state member for Campbelltown, Mr Michael Knight, they do not have access to the forum of parliament to respond in their defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To start with, I was at the meeting because I was invited by the President of the Migrant Resource Centre, Sergeant Jeff Trichter, to be the keynote guest speaker, as I had been the previous year, in recognition of my long-term support for the organisation. In fact, Sergeant Trichter telephoned my office on three occasions to check that I would be attending. At the same time, he also invited Mr Primrose, who, as I said, is the state Labor candidate for Camden, and his wife Jan to attend.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Here we go, indeed. My point of order is under standing order 145 in relation to relevance. I appreciate that the appropriations are a very wide ranging debate, and I do not necessarily want to stop the member from discussing the Migrant Resource Centre which he is quite entitled to do. But I think he is going way beyond that and I ask you to bring the member back to matters that he was legitimately raising.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Secondly, neither Mr Primrose nor his wife were able to attend the meeting because at the very time of the meeting Mr Primrose was performing the happy duties of best man at his brother's wedding in Camden. The minister also alleged that Councillor Paul Lynch of the Liverpool City Council&mdash;the ALP candidate for Liverpool&mdash;had attended the meeting. In fact, at the time of the meeting, Councillor Lynch was attending to his council responsibilities in another city. The minister is wrong again!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already dealt with the outrageous claim made by Minister Photios that I threatened to defund the MRC&mdash;to take away its federal funding&mdash;unless the meeting was deferred. This is a most serious allegation and, as I have said already, it is an outrageous and malicious lie. It is hard enough to get sufficient funding for community organisations. I certainly did not, and would never, threaten an organisation servicing my own electorate with losing its funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is unlike the party that Mr Photios and Dr Kernohan represent&mdash;the Liberal Party&mdash;which has been responsible for the closure of many vital services throughout my electorate. These include the Camden offices of the Department of Community Services, Prospect Electricity and, most notoriously, the children's ward at Camden District Hospital&mdash;all of this in an area with the fastest growth rate and the youngest population in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister then claims that I demanded the deferral of this annual general meeting. In fact, the motion to defer the meeting was moved by the representative of the local St Vincent de Paul office and seconded by an employee of the Macarthur Disabled Persons Resource Centre. I might mention that neither of these two people are, or ever have been, members of the ALP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion to defer the meeting had nothing to do with the question of who may or may not have won a particular ballot in the annual elections. It was moved on the basis of problems arising from the period prior to the conduct of the annual general meeting. The motion requested that the meeting be deferred to allow for mediation in order to resolve matters which were in dispute in relation to the conduct of the annual elections and, further, that the Australian Electoral Commission be asked to conduct the elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion was moved at the beginning of the meeting just as I was about to be asked to address the meeting as guest speaker. It was to my great concern and embarrassment that I then became aware that there was a serious dispute within the organisation over the conduct of the annual elections. I am now aware that this involves court challenges and several allegations of improprieties. Notwithstanding this, the move to place the matter in the hands of the Australian Electoral Commission was opposed by Sergeant Trichter and also by several other prominent members of the existing management committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was at this stage that I took the opportunity to express my concern at what was occurring, and to suggest that perhaps the meeting should be deferred to enable the matters in dispute to be resolved by the appropriate authorities. I expressed concern at the possible damage to the organisation which could be caused by the escalation of the dispute, especially given reports of the closure of migrant resource centres in other states. This was a reflection of my genuine concern and could not possibly be construed either as a demand that the meeting be deferred or as a threat to defund the centre, as the minister has alleged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As it turned out, Mr Knight, in his role as returning officer, found that he could not make a determination of the outcome of the deferral motion due to uncertainty over the membership credentials of some of the people in attendance. So, after a tense hour or two, the meeting was indeed deferred by agreement of all parties&mdash;and I emphasise `by agreement of all parties'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the minister's allegations that the meeting was stacked with Labor Party members to take over the centre. The minister claims that these people were from the Camden branch of the ALP. I myself am a member of the Camden branch of the ALP. As the federal member, you would expect that if there were members of my own party branch present I would recognise them. But, in fact, I can only recall seeing three members of the Camden branch in attendance at the meeting, including me&mdash;there were me and two others. As about 100 people attended on the day, I do not think that two could be considered as a stack of an organisation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister went on to accuse Mr Warton of walking large numbers of people into the meeting and of orchestrating the alleged stack by using his mobile phone. I certainly did not see him walking anybody into the meeting, and he actually does not even own a mobile phone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already said, Mr Primrose and Mr Lynch, who were somehow supposed to be involved in this conspiracy with me, were not even at the meeting. The minister's whole story is nothing but a tissue of lies based on the fertile imaginations of those with a political motive to smear the Labor Party and some of its members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very interested to know, though, what allegedly forged documents the minister has in his possession. As I have no knowledge at all of what he is talking about, I presume that this is in the same realm of fantasy as his other allegations. However, given that all of the documents relating to the annual general meeting had been held by Sergeant Trichter for some weeks prior to the AGM, it is difficult to know how anyone else had any opportunity at all to do anything with these alleged documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Photios further alleges that this so-called Labor Party stack was aimed at the reinstatement of a former employee of the centre, Ms Mary Seaman. Ms Seaman has recently accepted an out of court settlement to a case of unfair dismissal in the New South Wales Industrial Commission. She was not present at the meeting, she is not a member of the MRC and she no longer lives in the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In making his untrue and inaccurate claims of a Labor Party takeover, Mr Photios quoted comments made by Mr Kevin Doyle, the treasurer and publicity officer of the MRC, which were published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Macarthur Chronicle</EMPHASIS> on 22 November. Mr Doyle claimed that members of the left wing of the Labor Party were trying to stack the MRC to take control of the management committee so that they could give themselves jobs. I have already dealt with these allegations in some detail. Mr Doyle's claims, like those of Mr Photios, are patently untrue and, given the nature of his claim, they could only have been politically motivated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Photios has clearly misled the New South Wales parliament and has recklessly abused parliamentary privilege. Mr Photios should apologise to all the people he has so flagrantly slandered, and he should also resign as a minister. If he does not resign, Premier John Fahey should have the guts to sack him. Mr Fahey said recently at his Liberal Party conference that some of his Liberal Party colleagues had not been up to scratch and he had had to show some of them the door. He should now show Mr Photios the door. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the annual general meeting of 12 November, I have been informed of some of the background to the real circumstances which exist at the Macarthur Migrant Resource Centre. As I said earlier, this dispute involves court proceedings and several allegations of impropriety. I understand many of these matters are now sub judice, so accordingly I am unable to detail them at this time. Rather than abuse parliamentary privilege, as Mr Photios has done, I will allow the appropriate authorities to deal with these matters which, I point out, have nothing whatsoever to do with the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would appear, however, that these matters have had a shattering effect on the morale of workers at the Macarthur Migrant Resource Centre. What has happened is that the workers, many of whom are non-white, of non-English speaking background and female, feel intimidated by the actions of some members of the current all-white, English speaking, male dominated executive. It seems that the current executive has a very poor relationship with the staff and other committee members of the Migrant Resource Centre. I am told that the non-white, non-Anglo-Celtic people at the centre do not feel that they are accorded the same respect and status enjoyed by others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Matters at the centre have apparently deteriorated to an extent where people who have come to Australia from violent and traumatic lands now feel the same sense of threat and trepidation from the very people who have been appointed as their advocates and protectors. But, for the reasons I have mentioned, I do not intend to detail the extremely serious complaints and allegations which have been made by these people. I understand that the proper authorities have been advised in full of these matters, and I have no doubt at all that they will be treated with the seriousness that is due. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After the comments of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland), it is perhaps appropriate that we should deal with Appropriation Bill (No. 3), Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2), which are the subject of discussion before the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose the comments of the honourable member did draw attention to some appropriations that are made from time to time by the Commonwealth to community organisations. In some instances, the standards of management of those organisations do not justify the Commonwealth resources that are provided to them. Without wanting to refer specifically to the organisation he mentioned, about which I have no personal knowledge, I can say that there are sadly many instances throughout the community where factional groups and arguments prevent organisations from carrying out the purpose for which they received the Commonwealth grant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This raises a matter of concern about the way in which organisations in the community are sometimes used to promote government objectives and to spend taxpayers' money. We need always to be sure that those funds are spent wisely and well. I have seen in my own electorate and in other places examples where feuding and disagreement have made it very difficult for the intended objectives of the organisation to be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to some of the matters dealt with in these appropriation bills. I refer initially to the appropriation provided in these bills for the Australia Remembers commemoration next year. I would like to commend the government on the initiatives it is taking to help make next year's 50th anniversary of the end of World War II a significant event in Australian history. World War II did contribute much to the richness of Australia's history. It taught us a lot about the horrors of war, but it also demonstrated to the world much of the heroic nature of the Australian serviceman and our capacity as a nation to contribute to important international causes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia Remembers is a very important occasion for Australians and deserves appropriate recognition. Our objective over the year should be to acknowledge the great privilege that we as Australians have to live in peace and to recognise the contribution of Australian service men and women who died during the war and in subsequent years. We should also thank those remaining service personnel for their efforts. We also need to acknowledge the role played by those other Australians who kept the country operating during the war years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is particularly appropriate that days such as VE day and VP day be recognised in this country because of the role played by Australians in those significant events and the contribution those events made to securing a generation of peace for Australians and guaranteeing that our continent would be spared the ravages of war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to commend the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) on the even-handed way in which he is approaching these celebrations. Unlike so many events organised by the Labor government in the past, which have tended to develop a political focus, it seems the minister has endeavoured to evenly spread around Australia the resources that are being provided so that every electorate can enjoy and participate in Australia Remembers commemorations. In my own electorate, we are doing quite a lot of work towards organising activities. We are looking forward to our share of the funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has indicated that approximately $20,000 will be available to each federal electorate to assist with Australia Remembers commemorations. The $20,000 on a per electorate basis in some sense sounds fair, although it does tend to concentrate the amount of money available in the capital cities where there are a lot of federal electorates and where there will therefore be very large budgets to spend on appropriate commemorations. I have to spread that $20,000 amongst 50 separate towns in my electorate. It is obviously not going to go all the way around. I would very much like to see larger allocations being given to rural, regional and provincial areas. I have probably 20 different RSL branches within my electorate, so sadly the $20,000 will not go around. Nonetheless, we put together a selection committee that will allocate funds to ensure that some of the Australia Remembers celebrations can occur in each and every community within the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to encourage the government to be generous in making Defence Force personnel available to assist in the Australia Remembers commemoration. I know that comes from a different budget from that of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Sadly, the defence budget has been depleted so much over recent years that there is a limited capacity to do what I think should be done in 1995 to help commemorate Australia Remembers. Many organisations would like to have defence personnel present to help add prestige and a military dimension to their proposed celebrations. In Kingaroy, which is in my electorate, there is a proposal to have an air pageant to commemorate VE day and to particularly mark the role played by Kingaroy in air force training and the activities of the air force during World War II. They have asked to have some air force presence, including the Roulettes, to help make that a very important celebration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the defence department will be able to make some air force personnel available to add to that day's celebrations which will recognise the role that Kingaroy played in training so many air force pilots, including some very significant names in Australian history. I hope they will be able to be present on that day to add to the commemoration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, I refer to the announcement that medals are to be available to some people who served in ancillary services, such as the Women's Land Army. Some of those medals will be available for presentation during 1995. It would be good to have a military parade to recognise those people who will be honoured and who will finally have their service during and around World War II and in subsequent conflicts recognised through the presentation of a medal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to have parades to adequately recognise those people, it will require some Defence Force commitment. I hope the government will take that on board and make people available wherever possible to assist in making those commemorations as significant as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While handing out bouquets to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, I have to draw his attention to a matter which pleased me much less. The government recently announced new initiatives to assist Vietnam veterans in Australia. I was very disturbed to learn from counsellors who participated in the Vietnam veterans country outreach program that the government is about to axe the program. This seems to be an extraordinary action on the part of the government on the eve of the Australia Remembers commemoration in light of the commitments made by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, I am sure in all sincerity, to do more to assist Vietnam veterans. It seems the government has decided to axe this counselling service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are seven counsellors in my electorate who are employed for 32 hours per month to assist Vietnam veterans with their various needs. That is not an enormous commitment from the government, but it seems that the government wants this service to become voluntary. This is a very stressful occupation. It is stressful not only for the counsellors themselves, some of whom are from families of Vietnam veterans, but also for the immediate families of the counsellors because the veterans call in at all hours and the counsellors are called out at all hours. It places a burden on their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the minister to expect these counsellors to perform this service for nothing is clearly unreasonable. Most of the counsellors who are currently involved in the program have indicated to me that they are not prepared to do that work without some kind of financial assistance. Apparently, all the minister is prepared to offer them is a bit of mileage and some reimbursement for their outgoing telephone calls. The government wants these counsellors to perform this highly skilled and very stressful task without any reimbursement. Frankly, that is unreasonable. I call on the Minister for Veterans' Affairs to reconsider his attitude to this matter and continue the funding for the Vietnam veterans country outreach program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final point in the area of veterans affairs relates to the Australia Remembers commemoration. There has been a lot of pressure within my electorate&mdash;and I am sure in other places as well&mdash;for a public holiday to commemorate VP Day. That is a day of great significance for Australia. It was a day of great celebration 50 years ago; it was a public holiday 50 years ago. It would certainly add greatly to the public's acknowledgment of that day if there were a holiday for VP Day again in 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that employers and businesses are reluctant to have more holidays. We certainly have plenty of them in this country, and more than most. Why not in this very special year transfer, say, the Labour Day holiday&mdash;a holiday which is celebrated on various days around Australia&mdash;to VP Day to mark a very significant event? If the labour movement is reluctant to give away its holiday for one year, perhaps the Queen's Birthday holiday could for one year be on this day to recognise this important event. If that day is not suitable, there are many show days or pupil free days in schools that could surely be transferred to VP Day to help local communities better celebrate this important event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that choosing holidays is a matter for state governments. I think the Minister for Veterans' Affairs could exercise some influence with his state colleagues, and with local government since they are also capable of recommending holidays, particularly for show days. Surely for one year we could use one of the existing holidays to help guarantee that VP Day is properly remembered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst dealing with defence matters, I note also that, despite the fact that we have a hard pressed defence budget and a white paper currently before the parliament which slashes defence expenditure to the lowest level since World War II, the Department of Defence is still going to have to find around $10 million to redecorate the Prime Minister's jet. It seems an extraordinary priority, when we cannot find money to adequately staff the defence battalions and we cannot find money for new equipment, that $10 million is going to have to be found to upgrade the Prime Minister's 707 jet because, apparently, it does not meet his imperial standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of these modifications, it will be more difficult to use that 707 jet in its primary defence role&mdash;namely, transporting troops in times of conflict. It will be difficult to modify the jet for that purpose. Apparently, there is $8 million in these appropriations to redecorate the Prime Minister's jet. In these tough economic times, one wonders about that priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are being told by the government at the present time that the recession is over, good times have come and we now need to take measures to help dampen the enthusiasm in the economy. Once again, Labor's response to the improved economy is to suggest that we need to dampen it down with more taxes. I find it remarkable that in times of improved economic activity Labor chooses to adopt a more tax solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we were in the recession the government's solution was also more taxes. In that case it wanted more taxes so it could stimulate the economy. Now it wants more taxes so that it can suppress the economy. It does not matter what the problem is, Labor's solution is always higher taxes. The government totally lacks imagination in dealing with the economy because the only solution it can ever find is higher taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government needs to remember that there is already a stack of higher taxes that will be inflicted upon Australians next year as a result of last year's budget, including higher sales taxes, higher petrol taxes and higher tobacco taxes. All of these taxes hurt middle and ordinary Australians more than they hurt those on higher incomes. These taxes will be inflicted on Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To hear the government now talk about a raft of new taxes is a totally inappropriate response to the current economic improvement. Indeed, higher fuel taxes, higher indirect taxes, will hurt the people who are not benefiting from any kind of improvement in the economy. People in rural and regional parts of Australia know nothing about any kind of improved economy. They are still suffering from drought and recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To increase fuel taxes would hurt the very people who are still in the depths of recession. It is deplorable that any member opposite would be advocating higher fuel taxes in these circumstances. Australia taxes fuel more inappropriately than any country in the world. If there is any country that ought not tax fuel, it is Australia, which is so vast and spread over an enormous continent. By taxing fuel we penalise our productive industries. They are the ones that need fuel to transport their produce to port. They are the ones who need to locate their business and their activity away from the capital cities. They are the ones who bear the disproportionate share of the fuel tax burden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this country we already impose more than $10 billion worth of taxation as a result of distance. Distance should never be taxed. We should be encouraging people to live, locate and do business away from the capital cities. The only way that can be done is to reduce fuel taxes rather than impose higher taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I call on the government to immediately rule out the possibility of higher fuel taxes. In fact, it should rule out the possibility of any new taxes in this situation. The government will reap an automatic windfall in tax revenue because the economy is picking up. It does not need higher levels of taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the last federal budget, which the Treasurer (Mr Willlis) proudly announced as a no new taxes budget. Of course, that was not true; there were some new taxes in the budget. But even without increasing existing taxes specifically, the government still budgeted on an income tax increase of 8.4 per cent; 5.7 per cent more from the Medicare levy; seven per cent increase in company tax; 27 per cent increase in super funds taxes; and a fringe benefits tax increase of an incredible 131 per cent&mdash;all of that without any increases in tax. Sales taxes went up by 7.7 per cent, fuel excise went up by 12.6 per cent and there was a 6.3 per cent increase in other excises. The government reaped that tax windfall without increasing taxes. Frankly, all of those figures will be understated. Because of the improvement in the economy, the government's haul from taxes will be even greater. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no excuse whatsoever for higher taxes. There are plenty of excuses for the government to cut its own expenditure and to cut its own waste. Sadly, in this appropriation bill we are allocating more money for more government waste. There are so many examples of where the government has failed to cut its own budget and where it has failed to draw in its own expenditure. It prefers instead to raise levels of taxes to penalise ordinary Australians, the people who are trying to get their businesses up and running again. Not only do they slave and struggle under increasing government regulation and higher charges and taxes, but they are also never rewarded for their effort. Their reward for higher profitability, for putting in those extra hours, is more taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As our economy improves, the government should recognise that that improvement is directly the result of the individual efforts of Australian small business and industry. It has nothing to do with any brainstorm on behalf of the Prime Minister or any intervention on the government's part. It is entirely due to the efforts of individual Australians. Those efforts should be rewarded, encouraged and acknowledged&mdash;not penalised through higher taxes. The government needs to take that into account in proposing its mini-budget early next year and in its future budgetary planning. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>Our constitution was created as a clause of an act of the British parliament. It is very difficult to imagine in the 1990s how we would go about putting in place a constitution to create the federation of Australia. It is a bit hard to imagine being in the situation of the British parliament, being required to achieve the outcome. That is not to say that we do not need to look at contemporary Australia and to think about those things that are made more difficult because of the constitution being created in the 1890s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the increasing frustrations that I have as a member of the Australian parliament is that often the things we would like to achieve are frustrated, or made more complicated, because of the need to wend our way through the sensitivities of Commonwealth-state relations. I see the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh) at the table. We have a debate at the moment about national competition policy. It is a quite complex and complicated policy on its own without having the difficulties of looking at it in the context of agreements between the Commonwealth and the states. I raise that as one example because I believe there has not been sufficient debate about competition policy arising out of the Hilmer report and that there is perhaps a lack of understanding of its ramifications. When people investigate those ramifications, it becomes even more difficult because it is hard to identify what means will be used to achieve outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be of interest to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the minister at the table to know that last week the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts revisited Lake Mungo, one of the first four areas placed on the World Heritage List. I do not know whether both of you were on the previous visit. I was not a member of the committee at the time but have often heard about the very interesting meeting that you had with the leaseholders. Unfortunately I have to report that, nearly 10 years down the track, not much has changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a classic example of the Australian parliament and the Australian government having the responsibility under their treaty obligations of ensuring that those places under World Heritage listing are properly managed while the day-to-day management of those places resides in the hands of a state government. After a decade, we really have not put in place a management regime shared between the Commonwealth and, in this instance, the New South Wales government which would achieve clear outcomes&mdash;which would protect those values that have caused that area to be placed on the register and, at the same time, give a degree of direction and certainty to those people who live in the area and who try to make an economic existence out of their stewardship of that land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that we could all come up with examples which show the difficulties Australia has in the 1990s in a whole raft of areas of public administration because of the nature of our federation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We reflect upon the creation of the federation and there is from time to time, quite rightly, some very harsh criticism of the way in which the constitution was put in place. Arising from some comments of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in June of this year, there appeared an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> under the heading `Constitution a grubby compromise'. The author of the article was Richard White, a historian at the Sydney University. The first part of the article was critical of the Prime Minister for the way in which he has assessed what happened in that important time in our history. I believe that was a little unfair. I will go to the latter parts of his article where he says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Constitution that was produced was a compromise, in many parts a rather grubby compromise or a wilfully vague one.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a bit harsh, 100 years on, to be critical of the way in which the constitution was put together. Richard White further states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They comprised "founding fathers" if you like but were, more accurately, a group of middle class politicians, mostly lawyers, Alexander Downer's grandfather among them.</PARA>
<PARA>For the purposes of this debate, I do not want to belabour that point. Certainly, in the way in which the community was debating federation at the time, for various reasons, there were people who were concerned. At the time of Federation, the labour movement was divided about the question and was very cautious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The newspaper the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Worker</EMPHASIS> expressed some concerns about the young federation becoming a plutocracy under the influence of `bribed leaders and corrupt statesmen'. The Melbourne based <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tocsin</EMPHASIS> was similarly bitterly opposed to the powers given to the Governor-General and felt that Australian liberty had been imperilled by federation. Some in the labour movement would say that was very prescient of what occurred during the 1970s. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Worker</EMPHASIS> concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Essentially the spirit of a federal movement was democratic and the nation . . . must if it is true to itself . . . even become more democratic.</PARA>
<PARA>The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tocsin</EMPHASIS> finally accepted the Commonwealth Act, stating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . for better or worse. We shall try to find in it secret charms for bettering the condition of Victoria and Australia. We shall strive to make of it a charter of liberty for the distant future.</PARA>
<PARA>Despite those reservations, from the outset it has been the labour movement that has seen the need for constitutional change to reflect the changing needs of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context, I should also raise a statement by the founder of the Liberal Party, who recognised that a constitution needs to grow and adapt to change. In 1967, Robert Gordon Menzies suggested:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A written constitution is an express scheme of government designed to give a basic structure in a changing world, not designed to inhibit growth in a growing world, nor to make the contemporary world subject to the political, social or economic ideas of a bygone age.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian constitution has not changed very much. It is still a document suited to the social and economic conditions of the 1890s, when it was conceived. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at some of the pamphlets circulated during the run-up to federation, we see one that compared the proposed constitution with the then fledgling Swiss and American constitutions. This pamphlet made the bold claim that it would be easier, under the proposed Australian constitution, to achieve constitutional change than it would be under the American constitution. I think the history of the past century&mdash;in the case of the American constitution, a greatly longer period&mdash;proves that the American constitution has proved in its ability to be amended a much more pliable document that can be changed to represent contemporary ideas and views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The problems that have been created by this inflexibility and lack of change within the Australian constitution are well known. Earlier I gave some examples, but perhaps the situation was best summarised by a graphic illustration given by then Prime Minister Bob Hawke in 1990. Mr Hawke gave the example of a cargo container being sent by rail between Sydney and Perth that may have been subject to three non-integrated railway systems, four changes in locomotives, five different safe working systems, six different sizes of loading gauge, 10 different engineering standards of basic standard gauge rail track and 12 or more hours at sidings or junctions for crew changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of those problems catalogued in that example are slowly but surely being addressed. We are looking at the national rail grid. Some of the things that Mr Hawke talks about which concern different standards of safety and associated issues are laboriously being addressed. Arising out of an Industry Commission report on accident compensation, at the level of COAG we will look at those issues, at our separate jurisdictions, because those matters reside within the powers that were reserved by the colonies back in the 1990s, and at the way in which we can put in place a national policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As Richard White said, the founding fathers, whom I quoted earlier, were often regarded with undue reverence. Back in the 1970s, Don Dunstan pointed out that they were really little more than state politicians protecting vested interests. What we need to do is to ask how, in the 1990s, we can wind back the clock and how we can wind back those attitudes that were motivated by these vested interests so that we can achieve change that focuses on looking at Australia as one nation, rather than looking at Australia as a continuing collection of the six colonies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We should realise that the founding fathers knew well that they were condemning future generations. Manning Clark pointed out in his history of Australia that as early as the late 1840s the Whig Earl Grey warned the colonists about the dangers of separate parliaments `legislating on such subjects of common interest as railway gauges'. Clark continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The price for colonial folly was that New South Wales adopted the standard railway gauge, Victoria five feet three inches, and Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia three feet six inches.</PARA>
<PARA>At the time of Federation, those issues were not immediately or magically addressed because of the creation of the federation or the way the constitution was framed. It has taken us progressively over the last century to be able to address the problems that the earlier colonial decisions created. I think it is worth repeating a quote of Don Dunstan: We are now left with results of their work&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the state politicians&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a system of sovereign governments whose boundaries bear no relation to physical, social or economic geography, and which are limited in their attempts to legislate efficiently in such important areas as trade practices or national transport because the framers of the Constitution on the one hand did not believe that governments should be concerned with the economy or business practices, and on the other they foresaw no problems emerging.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Dunstan also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The system as a whole is inefficient and debilitating. And as the years pass the writing of the Constitution becomes enveloped in the mists of time, that well known contagion of Federated States can be seen developing high-minded reverence for the Founding Fathers. Any criticism of their document becomes a kind of political blasphemy. They are even now being seen as far-sighted, despite the fact that when they drew the document up about the only matters they considered crucial to national Government were defence, an end to custom barriers and an efficient post office . . .</PARA>
<PARA>One of the driving forces that moved politicians in the six colonies to agitate for federation was the influence of the French and the Germans in their efforts to colonise our region. For others, it was the concern that they had of either Asian invasion or Asian takeover through migration. In the 1990s we are having debates about free trade throughout the world and, in particular, yesterday's debate arising from the APEC meeting in Bogor about free trade in our region. In that context it is interesting that one of the driving forces for the colonies in getting together to create the Federation was free trade between the colonies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So where does that leave us at the moment? It leaves us in a situation whereby, through COAG as a meeting of heads of governments, we are trying to achieve a cooperative approach to the way in which we can tackle the problems that confront Australia. Because of what is sometimes termed `the new federalism', whereby we have to achieve national policies through the agreement of both the national and state governments and national and state legislatures, a great degree of compromise is needed to achieve outcomes. Without suggesting that consultation in any form is a bad thing, to achieve this cooperation&mdash;to do it right&mdash;requires lengthy consultation, which delays our ability to put in place change and delays our ability to address problems at a national level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We have slowly come to grips with the fact that, in economic policy terms, only the national government can give the direction. There are still tensions in place, because of the 1942 court decision that gave income tax raising powers to the Commonwealth, about the sharing of resources. There is continuing concern where people are conjuring up this concept of states rights without thinking that we should be talking about people's individual rights and the need for a national direction in those areas of policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had not intended to speak about the constitution but, given that the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) has raised this subject and done so in an interesting but, I would argue, wrong way, I will address a few of his points. The constitution is a document that was designed in the 1890s but, as Sir Isaac Isaacs said, it was designed to be the birth certificate of a nation. As our nation has changed, so our constitution has changed. Our constitution is not perfect, but there is nothing wrong with it that becoming a republic is going to fix.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Scullin raised various issues of overlap, duplication, waste and so on which he believes stem from the existence of the states. The problem with his line of argument is that it does not actually help the agenda of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for constitutional reform unless the Prime Minister is prepared to accept that becoming a republic should also include abolishing the states. I would think that that is in fact part of the Prime Minister's long-term agenda, but it is certainly not something that he is prepared to admit at the moment. In fact, at the moment the Prime Minister is saying that if the states did not exist it would be necessary to invent them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Scullin has fallen into the trap which so many members opposite fall into&mdash;namely, in their desire to bring about certain changes to our constitution, they are rubbishing the entire document. The member for Scullin read articles from some academic who was talking of our constitution as `a grubby compromise'. I would have thought that compromise was part of life. Effective life in civil society means knowing when to compromise, because compromise of some sort is simply inevitable. Putting a pejorative adjective in front of the word `compromise' does not change that fact. He may as well have spoken about `grubby cooperation', but of course he would not talk that way because we all know that cooperation is part of life and it is essential if we are going to have the kind of society that people are happy to live in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the constitution was originally an act of the British parliament, but that was the icing on the cake. The essence of our constitution was decided by the Australian people in Australia for Australians by a series of constitutional conventions. For the member for Scullin or anyone else to say that it was rammed down our throat by Queen Victoria in the British parliament is simply a slander on Australia's history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, documents&mdash;even documents like the constitution&mdash;do need to be changed from time to time. But the changes must address the real needs of the people and not the imaginary needs and the cheap political interests of certain political sections and ideologies in society. The fact is that, if you look at the constitutions which were changed most often in the modern world, you get constitutions like that of the former Soviet Union. That constitution went through five or six incarnations in 70 years. On paper, the constitution of the Soviet Union was the most relevant and up-to-date constitution in the world, but it did not matter at all as far as protecting rights in the Soviet Union was concerned, because there was no cohesive culture&mdash;political culture, culture of human rights&mdash;behind it. The fact is that, if our constitution needs to change to serve the needs of the Australian people, it must change. But it must not change simply to serve the needs of the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appropriation bills that are before the House at the moment indicate the sorry reality of Australia's economic condition. By contrast, the Prime Minister's self-adulation, expressed in his statement about the APEC meeting at Bogor, demonstrates the fantasy land that this government is living in. The Prime Minister said that the APEC agreement permanently changed our region and the world. He put the APEC agreement up there on the same pedestal as the Bretton Woods agreement, which laid the foundations for the international economic conditions of the postwar world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the Prime Minister's great political hero is none other than Jack Lang. Jack Lang supporters used to run around Sydney back in the 1930s saying that Lang was greater than Lenin. At least Jack Lang had the decency to let his supporters say that he was greater than Lenin. The Prime Minister lacks that decency. In standing up here and boasting about APEC and Bogor, what he was really saying was: `Paul Keating is greater than Roosevelt; Paul Keating is greater than Churchill; Paul Keating is greater than John Maynard Keynes. I am greater than these architects of the post world war economic world.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it any wonder that well-known and able journalistic commentator, Mr Greg Sheridan, was forced to say in his recent column that the Prime Minister was suffering from Bogor fever? The Prime Minister has caught Bogor fever and is deep in the throws of that dreadful disease. The Prime Minister said that APEC was our chance to sit at a big table. The PM is obsessed with big tables, as long as they come from Thailand and as long as they are made of teak. I suppose he wants his Thai teak table to go with his Thai knighthood: a Knight Grand Cordon of the Most Exalted Order of the White Elephant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's statement on APEC shows serious historical amnesia in that he has totally forgotten one of the fundamental planks of the last election campaign. The Prime Minister went round this country saying to the workers of the textile industry, the motor industry and the footwear industry, `Vote Labor, because Labor will protect your tariffs.' Now he is saying that within a few short years tariffs will be abolished, not because we in Australia want them to be abolished but because APEC, apparently, is telling us that they should be abolished. The Prime Minister has forgotten in just a short space of time the fundamental plank on which he fought the last election. He has exposed himself as the real Captain Zero of Australian politics, the real deceiver of our political system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second case of historical amnesia is that the Prime Minister has said that he produced APEC. If any Australian politician is to claim credit for APEC, it should be the former Prime Minister Bob Hawke. Bob Hawke is the real ghost at the Prime Minister's APEC banquet. Hawke has been removed by the current Prime Minister from the APEC picture in much the same way that Stalin had Trotsky removed from the photographs of the old Bolsheviks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third and most serious case of historical amnesia is that the Prime Minister does not know or understand the history of this country. I refer to a government report which commended a certain course of action because that course of action would provide `facilities for carrying on trade with India and the Malay Peninsula as well as with China'. That report was not written for Paul Keating last year. It was not written for Bob Hawke five years ago. It was not written for Bob Menzies a generation ago. It was written for Governor Stirling of Western Australia back in 1828. The point I am making is that Australia has been interested in Asia, vitally concerned with Asia and deeply involved with Asia for as long as this country has existed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to remember who has and who has not got the right stuff on Asia. It was Bob Menzies and not Paul Keating who first talked about Asia as our `near north'. It was Percy Spender and not the current Prime Minister who implemented the Colombo Plan, which brought tens of thousands of Asia's future leaders to our shores. It was Bob Menzies and Black Jack McEwen and not the current Prime Minister who established the trade treaty with Japan which resulted in the total reorientation of our trade in just a few short years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was Harold Holt and not the current Prime Minister who declared, back in 1966, that the next century would be `a century of Asia'. It was Harold Holt and not the current Prime Minister who ended the White Australia policy. At the very time he did so Labor was being led by a man who notoriously said, `Two wongs don't make a white'. That was the attitude of the Labor Party then. It was Malcolm Fraser and not the current Prime Minister who first began large scale Asian immigration to this country. Labor at that time was being led by a man who wanted to keep the boat people out because they were, he said, `f . . . ing yellow balts'. That is the record of the Labor Party as opposed to the record of the coalition on this subject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me also point out on this subject of relations with Asia that the first member of this parliament of Asian extraction was Senator Thomas Backhap, back in the early years of this century, who represented one of the forebears of the Liberal Party, the Nationalist Party. But to go into more detail as to which party is the party of Asia in this country, just how long Australians have been talking about the need to integrate with Asia and just what a Johnny-come-lately to this crusade the Prime Minister is, Sir John Latham said in 1934:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is inevitable that the relations between Australia and Asia . . . will become closer and more intimate as the years pass. Therefore, it is important that we should endeavour to develop and improve our relations with our near neighbours.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1939 Menzies said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that the Pacific is of all zones in the world, the zone in which our risks are primary risks and our responsibilities are primary responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that the government should:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . do everything that it can to increase our cultural relationship, our personal contact with them&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is to say with Asians&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and to improve all of those things which go to make a real and personal understanding.</PARA>
<PARA>In the 1950s Dick Casey said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our geographical situation is such that we must inevitably be brought into close touch with the peoples of Asia. If we make no effort to understand their problems, we can scarcely expect them to make an effort to understand ours. Differences of race, religion, language and culture could easily lead to regrettable misunderstandings which might adversely affect our relations with them.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a pity that the Prime Minister did not heed Dick Casey's advice. If he really understood Asian culture he would not have made his regrettable comments about the Prime Minister of Malaysia Dr Mahathir which led to months of trade tensions between Australia and one of our important trading partners. In the 1950s the Prime Minister of India Mr Nehru welcomed Australia's coming closer to Asia. So this idea that Asia was only discovered in December 1991, when the current Prime Minister assumed office, is a myth. The Prime Minister only discovered Asia then because until that point Asia had been something that you flew over on the way to the antique fairs of London and Paris. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude this part of my comments with another well-known Australian politician, this time speaking in the 1960s. He said that our destiny lay with Asia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we must fulfil it spiritually, unselfishly, with shining enlightenment . . . (This) will stand as the most glorious achievement, so far, in our history.</PARA>
<PARA>That politician was not the current Prime Minister; it was Sir Alexander Downer, the father of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us examine the reality of our current relationship with Asia. In 1968, 65 per cent of our total exports were already going to the Asia-Pacific region. In 1968 we already had nearly seven-tenths of our economic relationship with the Asia-Pacific region. That was 25 years ago. It has nothing to do with the current Prime Minister and everything to do with the good work of the Menzies government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our share of East Asian markets over the last few years has declined. Our exports to East Asia have been increasing as a percentage of our GDP but falling as a percentage of East Asia's GDP because its growth rates are higher than ours. Our penetration of East Asian markets has fallen since the early 1980s from four per cent of East Asian GDP to about 3 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Investment from Asia in this country has also fallen over the last few years. Australian investment in countries such as Britain and America has skyrocketed but our investment in Asia has stagnated. Our investment in Britain today is six times our total investment in ASEAN. I am not saying this to approve; I am saying it to indicate the reality of our economic position, which is that our relationship with Asia has gone backwards in the last few years, notwithstanding all the hyperbole of the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> APEC is certainly an important step in the right direction. One of the reasons why it is an important step in the right direction is that it is a small step in the improvement of our domestic economic position, which has been damaged by this government. This government has practised hairshirt economics. When times were good back in the 1980s, it put interest rates up to 17 per cent. When times were bad in the early 1990s, it put unemployment up to one million people. Now that times are allegedly good again, interest rates are going up again. In other words, before the economic recovery has crawled off the front pages of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>&mdash;it has not even got into people's pockets yet&mdash;interest rates are already going up. The last round of interest rate rises, let alone the next round, will amount to a tax of $100 a month on ordinary home buyers in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1980s we had interest rate rises we `had to have', in 1990 we had the recession we `had to have', now we are having more interest rate rises that we `had to have' and soon we will have another recession that we `had to have'. The Prime Minister has done it before and he will do it again. The tragedy of what this Prime Minister is doing to this country is that it amounts to a complete betrayal of the people that he and the Labor Party are supposed to represent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great ironies of the current situation is that Labor members opposite are only too happy to turn to traditional working class areas when they are looking for a safe seat, but they rush off to the rich parts of town when they are looking for a house. The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) is rushing off to a safer seat as fast as he can, given his vast bulk. At the same time we have the Prime Minister, who has a perfectly safe seat, rushing off to buy a $2.2 million mansion in Woollahra. The motto of this government is, if I might take the biblical lamentation: `To those who have, more shall be given. To those who have not, even what little they have shall be taken away.' It is a terrible indictment of a Labor government that that should be the case. </PARA>

Those opposite do not like the achievements that have taken place under the leadership of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). They do not like the fact that somebody of his renown can bring many countries of the world to agreement. They do not want to see that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate before the House today will give me an opportunity to bring some of our achievements to the notice of the House. Since 1983 we have been driven by a need to look at where we are going throughout Australia.

I am pleased that our government has been able to formulate policy on a scale that has assisted everyday Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are coming to the end of 1994. As our Labor government forges ahead, nothing has really changed for the Liberals. They have certainly become a lot more sluggish and, if one can take notice of what has been happening in the papers recently with the leadership debate, much more chaotic. Our Liberal state of disarray has certainly been summed up well by Glen Milne in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 28 November:</PARA>

<PARA>Mr Greiner's involvement and ineptitude in the ICAC debacle resulting from offering that Liberal defector Terry Metherell a highly paid Public Service job are certainly etched in the minds of the voters of New South Wales and, I dare say, Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More recently in the Australian Capital Territory, we should consider the Liberal opposition's actions in the Legislative Assembly where the leader, Kate Carnell, has just completed a backflip on the cannabis laws. Acknowledging that the Liberal Party has handled the issues badly, that assembly has had to amend the legislation which her party virtually helped pass. This backdown comes after strong pressure from various quarters, including the police and the Australian Medical Association, who all agree that the whole issue has not been thought through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The list of the federal government's positive moves is very impressive. Whether it be in our western suburbs of Sydney, where I proudly represent the electorate of Prospect, in the country areas of New South Wales, in the state of Victoria or on the Gold Coast, our government has been actively pursuing very progressive programs. As part of our government's commitment in Working Nation, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) and his very effective team have been making significant inroads into unemployment and are creating job opportunities. Hardly surprisingly, in discussing Working Nation's objectives and listening to others' views across Australia, the government's ideas have been met with enthusiasm and certainly with confidence. </PARA>

Recent DEET figures show that the number of skilled vacancies in major metropolitan newspapers has risen. This result sees increases in 12 out of the 16 major occupational groups, which means that the level of skilled vacancies has risen by more than 56 per cent over the past year. There is also good news about decreases in Australia's foreign debt. The latest figures show that net foreign debt fell for the fourth quarter in a row. Commentators have welcomed this result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By contrast, but perhaps not surprisingly, the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), has attributed the improvements to state governments and to the private sector.

He either clearly lacks understanding and knowledge or just refuses to understand what it is we are about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The list of worthwhile government initiatives is a very long and proud one. Through DEET's NETTFORCE projects, for instance, the federal government is campaigning to generate 17,000 new jobs in the Gold Coast region over the next six months. In central western New South Wales, by actively encouraging employers to take on additional employees, particularly the long-term unemployed, our government's endeavours should lead to an extra 5,500 new jobs in that area. Overall, since the launch of Working Nation in May of this year, there has been a substantial impact on long-term unemployment. We have now seen a reduction of almost 90,000 in the number of long-term unemployed people since March 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrast that with the coalition's performance and specifically look at the Liberals in Victoria.

Earlier this year, the federal Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) announced intentions to identify and plan for road and rail links between those two airports. He established the task force to work with the New South Wales government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales Liberal coalition government has not been easy to negotiate with, stipulating its involvement would be dependent on a Commonwealth government commitment to provide up-front funding of both road and rail links, including a $120 million funding commitment towards the city to Kingsford Smith airport rail link. Wanting to secure cooperation, our Commonwealth government attempted, as much as possible, to develop a good working relationship with the New South Wales government over this issue. But the New South Wales government would not agree to the State Rail Authority carrying out the engineering study for the rail link unless the Commonwealth gave a commitment to pay for the lot once again. Even after the Commonwealth made $200,000 available for that rail study, New South Wales continued to baulk at having any involvement in that engineering study. Eventually, the New South Wales Liberal coalition government reluctantly agreed to participate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent outcry about noise and low flying aircraft has certainly sparked a new controversy and debate about the opening of a third runway at Sydney's Mascot airport. Eyes will soon turn to developing the proposed airport at Badgerys Creek in Sydney's west. Certainly building the airport at Badgerys Creek has its attractions. It should lead, as I am informed&mdash;and statistics back it up&mdash;to the creation of thousands of jobs not only in constructing the airport and transport links but also in the companies that will relocate to our area. It also has scope to increase opportunities in the manufacturing and tourism sectors. </PARA>

It is proposed that this new road take long-distance heavy vehicles out of Sydney's local and arterial road system and form part of the link from Kingsford Smith airport to Sydney West airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regarding all aspects of the airport, however, on behalf of the constituents I represent, I would urge planners to consider carefully all implications for people residing within the area.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government in its Working Nation document committed itself to a longer runway at Badgerys Creek being finished by 1999. But various people now want that $73 million spending to be brought forward to the next calendar year and another $47 million allocated to the FAC dedicated to immediate construction of Badgerys Creek. I have personally written to the federal Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator John Faulkner, outlining in detail my concerns about all aspects of the proposal and its impact on people in my electorate. </PARA>

Anything less would fail to convince the community and may raise doubts about the intention of long-term airport operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot fast-track construction at Badgerys Creek without an updated full environmental impact statement on the issue. A very detailed EIS was completed in 1985, and I have read it, but many changes have occurred in western Sydney over the nine years since that EIS was completed. The 1985 EIS suggested a runway of 1,200 metres but in 1991&mdash;and I am pleased to say following a great deal of pressure from western New South Wales members&mdash;the then Minister for Transport changed the length of the runway to something like 1,800-odd metres. Also, following further representation to our federal minister, we have now announced the construction of an international standard 2.9 kilometre runway instead of the 1.8 kilometre general aviation facility that was originally planned for Badgerys Creek. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A whole host of environmental issues must be considered such as air quality and pollution, fuel, flooding, water run-off and the effects of a completed international airport on run-off.

The new site for the airport is very close to Horsley Park, Bossley Park, Smithfield, Greystanes and Fairfield&mdash;all areas and suburbs within the electorate that I represent. I have consistently recommended a very cautious approach to this development because of the potential for adverse impact on the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bearing in mind that the proposed airport is to be operational 24 hours a day, the possible situation for many people is very serious. Planners must think about the implications each time a heavily laden aircraft flies low over Sydney's most densely populated western region. They should particularly give consideration to take-off and landing in the early hours of the morning and the impact it would have on residents' lives. I wonder whether the planners and so-called experts realise the amount of noise generated by aircraft landing or taking off at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. This is what we must give consideration to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly sympathise with those people who are affected by the opening of the third runway. But I will say most sincerely that many people purchased properties in that region knowing the airport was there. Certainly, many have known it has been there for many years. Conversely, though, some people within my electorate had never contemplated having an airport in the area, even though now many welcome it&mdash;and certainly our council does. Years ago some made an initial choice to live in the quiet rural areas of the electorate and others, who have moved in since the 1975 subdivision started, would not have had any inkling that an airport could be constructed in the area and that they could end up under a flight path. I think that choice has now been taken away from a lot of people. As an article on flight paths, which appeared in last Saturday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS>, so very logically puts it:</PARA>

What we do want is adequate planning and consideration for people's welfare; what we do want is a continued guarantee from our minister and our government that, when that construction is put in place, it will be done efficiently and, as I have said repeatedly, with infrastructure so that the communication links by rail and road are completed.</PARA>

I put this on record in the House in the appropriation debate whilst at the same time commending the government and the ministry on what we have been able to do&mdash;it may be happening slowly, but it is happening&mdash;with industry and particularly with the people we represent: those long-term unemployed, those who did not have a place in history and who are very important.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure that you, like other members in this chamber, will be aware of the famous sports people that come from the electorate of Parkes: I guess the most famous would be Phillip Adams from Forbes. No Australian has won more Commonwealth Games medals, whether they be gold, silver or bronze, than Phillip. He has been a great ambassador for Australia in pistol shooting. Even as recently as yesterday, we had two Narromine athletes performing well for this country. Glenn McGrath plays cricket for Australia. Who could forget seeing, on our television screens last night, that famous inswinger cleaning up one of the English batsmen? Further, when I got back to the motel and turned on the TV, there was Melinda Gainsford winning the indoor 200 metres, beating even as famous a person as Cathy Freeman. But it is not about them that I want to talk today. I wish to talk about cleaning up drugs in sport. The athletes that I have just mentioned have been exemplary in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some time now, the world has been suspicious that China is guilty of using systematic doping to produce artificial world champions, particularly in swimming&mdash;though positives have turned up in drug testing of competitors in canoeing, athletics and other sports. If we look at swimming, we see that, of the world's top 25 rankings for each swimming stroke, in 1991 China had six listings; a year later that had increased fourfold to 24 listings; and a year later, in 1993, that had increased fourfold again to 96 listings. Such a meteoric rise in itself is suspicious, particularly as only one of those listings was a male, with the rest being female. The very top performers won six medals at the world's swimming championships in Perth in 1991; but this year, 1994, in September, in Rome at the Foro Italico pool, they won 24 medals. What is particularly notable is that all the medal winners this year were female; in fact, they won 12 of the 16 gold medals, and not one male Chinese swimmer made a final. That in itself causes a suspicion that they may be taking drugs. Only last month in October at the Asian Games in Hiroshima, the women won all 15 gold medals in swimming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this meteoric rise, there has been the very physical evidence, I believe, especially to the trained eye, of the use of drugs, particularly anabolic steroids, the testosterone derivatives, and human growth hormone. Looking at the female Chinese swimmers, we see about them a lot of non-feminine characteristics. There are the deep husky voices of the girls. At the world championships when Lu Bin came in and won the 200 metres freestyle, as well as being a relay competitor, her deep baritone voice apparently shocked the audience, including the 60 journalists, there. She said that she was not on drugs and that these accusations against Chinese female swimmers were racist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, apart from voice, another characteristic is excessive body hair, where it is not shaved, of course&mdash;particularly facial hair. Most alarming is the thickening and protrusion of the mandible, the lower jawbone. I guess equally if not more worrying are the characteristics that we do not see, some of which may not turn up for years&mdash;damage done to the liver from trying to detoxify the testosterone floating around in these athletes' bodies; the diabetes problems resulting from it; and, later in life, most tragically of all, the infertility problems caused by damage done to the reproductive systems of these girls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout all these accusations, the Chinese officials, including government officials, denied that any doping was going on. The athletes themselves have denied that any doping was going on. The accusers have been called racists. Even Juan Antonio Samaranch, the Chairman of the International Olympic Committee, who supported Beijing against Sydney for the 2000 Olympics, dismissed these allegations and declared China `very clean'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pattern that I have outlined amongst Chinese athletes, particularly the swimmers, is all very similar to what the world went through in the 1980s with happenings in East Germany before the Berlin Wall came down. Only in today's December edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Swimming World</EMPHASIS>, which has just been released in America, there is a very interesting article showing, from the opening up of the Stasi files&mdash;the Stasi, of course, being the East German secret police&mdash;that every East German world-class swimmer was doped. The evidence is there recorded. The testosterone levels&mdash;the male hormone levels&mdash;in those German female swimmers were very great indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, testosterone injected into females accelerates muscle growth and reduces the recovery times between events. A normal male will have about 40 parts per cubic centimetre of urine. There is some testosterone normally in a female but it is about five parts per cubic centimetre. In a normal individual walking around, the ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone&mdash;which is the natural preform of testosterone&mdash;is one to one. It can rise, abnormally, in exceptional circumstances to three to one. The International Olympic Committee has set a standard ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone at six to one. So, if people test positive to testosterone, there is no doubt that they take the drug. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Kristin Otto, the East German swimmer who won six gold medals at Seoul in 1988, had a ratio of 17 to one. According to the files, there were other East German girls whose levels fluctuated between nine to one and 12 to one. So the East German swimmers were a total pack of cheats, nothing more and nothing less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past two years, and before a recent event which I will come to in a minute, five Chinese swimmers have tested positive. The five includes Yang Aihua, who won the 400 metres at the world championships. Her test at the world championships turned up clear but she was tested randomly two weeks later, before the Asian Games, and she tested positive. According to one newspaper report, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 3 December, her test results were held up for several weeks:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to allow a suitable time to elapse between Samaranch's comment&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that the Chinese were very clean&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and the proof that Chinese sport was anything but very clean.</PARA>
<PARA>These five positives that have turned up over the last two years are equivalent to the total positive results in swimmers of all countries over the last 22 years. Indeed, 45 Chinese athletes overall&mdash;and that is outside swimming as well&mdash;have tested positive since 1987. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the Asian Games, something else happened. A surprise test was done on the swimmers three days before the games, not after, and 11 Chinese athletes turned up positive, including eight female swimmers. Those who tested positive included Lu Bin, who tried to scale a wall to avoid being tested after an event. She won the 200 metres at the world championships in 1:56.89. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Le Jingyi, who holds the world record, which she set at the world championships, for 50 metres of 24.51 and for 100 metres of 54.01, was excluded from the eight swimmers who turned up positive. She is the girl we have all been seeing on our television sets in recent weeks. She has very broad shoulders which taper down to a narrow waist. She looks like she has swung out of a tree with a gorilla and she would be the envy of every male bodybuilder in the world. She tested negative, but surely there is no doubt that she also is positive. I might just add that testosterone particularly helps the sprinters&mdash;and she is a 50-metre and a 100-metre sprinter&mdash;because of the bulk they put on. The benefit gained from using testosterone starts to dissipate when you get up to the distance events, such as the 800 metres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that the Chinese athletes have been able to avoid testing positive when they have been tested after the competition events because of such devices as flushing, whereby they use diuretics to flush out of the body the urine with the high testosterone in it so that the urine sample taken later is a dilute one. Apparently they have also been using masking drugs, which block the kidneys from excreting testosterone. By using these flushing and masking techniques, the drugs can be flushed out of the system within 48 hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is obvious that it is vital to use random testing of athletes and what is called `out of competition' testing of athletes to pick up this use. In the Chinese program, only about 20 per cent of their total testing is out of competition testing whereas in Australia 50 per cent of the tests fall into this category. We need these tests to be done to establish baseline levels for individual athletes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Chinese were tested, Lu Bin's level was very high indeed. I guess that the testosterone levels floating around in the bodies of Lu Bin and Le Jingyi would probably be equivalent to the level of the combined teams of the Canberra Raiders and the Brisbane Broncos. I say to the world international swimming community&mdash;particularly to the Chinese community&mdash;that, if they want their female swimmers to look like males, to act like males and to swim like males, they should ban them from the female events and let them compete in the male events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this is a human rights issue. Perhaps it should be taken up by the United Nations and perhaps education programs for female swimmers should be put in place. Yang, the 400-metre swimmer who has turned up positive, trains under Zhou Ming at the Guang Zhou Military Club, along with sprinter Le Jingyi, who won four gold medals and set four world records at the world titles, and the dual backstroke world champion, He Cihong. I would say that there is no doubt&mdash;the circumstantial evidence is very heavy indeed&mdash;that the coaches know what is going on with these swimmers, even though one of them did not test positive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would stress that it is not just the athletes who take the drugs but those who administer them who are particularly at fault. The Australian stance on coaches who are found administering drugs to athletes is that they should be banned not just for two or four years but for life. I believe that at present the swimmers are banned for only two years. So they can compete at one Olympic Games, be picked up with a positive test, dry out and compete at another Olympic Games. I believe they should be banned for four years, including one Olympic Games, and that all their medals and previous records should be stripped off them when that happens. I also believe that a country with a large number of athletes who test positive should forfeit its right to compete for a number of years until it can show that particular sport is clean to the satisfaction of International Olympic Committee standards. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to China to get rid of its cheats and to lift its standards on having disregard for the lives of the individual swimmers. Possibly some of the swimmers who are taking these tablets orally think they are taking vitamin pills and do not realise what in fact they are taking. That was certainly the case in East Germany.

As most of the honourable members in this House will recognise, appropriation bills are about money and the funding of government programs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While people, in principle, support the concept of a national electricity grid, it is a different issue when the power poles required for that grid are to go through their home and affect their livelihood or, more importantly&mdash;as the good citizens of Boonah would argue&mdash;they are to go through a recognised scenic rim. Over 200 people attended a public meeting in Boonah last week to voice their opposition to the proposed route for the QEC east link. They have formed themselves into a group called the Boonah Citizens Opposed to East Link. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It befits the government to listen to those community concerns and to evaluate them so that, if the option is chosen to put powerlines through there, the decision is made with all the facts to hand and taking into consideration all the issues that the community has raised. Many of the issues raised at that public meeting had not been brought to the attention of the QEC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area in which the QEC intends to place these powerlines covers the Mount French National Park, the Mount Greville National Park, the Main Range National Park, the Mount Barney National Park and the Lamington National Park. These areas are recognised as having value to the community. These areas should be preserved and their character should be preserved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area itself is recognised as being part of the scenic rim. It embraces a number of shires and it has changed from a dairying community to a tourism community. That is particularly important. It has nine outdoor education establishments for school children and it is the largest area that provides such facilities in south-east Queensland. Over 10,000 students per year visit this area to participate in outdoor education pursuits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those establishments have chosen this area because of its beauty and because of its access to both the mountains and the water&mdash;although, sadly, there is not too much water at the moment.

That is one issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue has been the pursuit of tourism as the area has attempted to diversify from fairly intensive dairy farming. Indeed, over 10,000 adults a year visit this area on wilderness holidays. Mount Barney lodge camping ground cites how it offers the opportunity to share our wilderness heritage. Yarramalong advertises indoor recreation with privacy, no overcrowding, and horse riding facilities. The national horse trails go through this area. O'Reilly's mountain resort is there.

All of those operations are placed at risk if the QEC east link connection goes through this area. How on earth can people parachute if they are in danger of falling onto powerlines?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A matter of real concern is an admission by the QEC that it uses chemicals under its powerlines to keep the grass at bay. Does a farmer who has to put up with these terrible powerlines through the middle of his farm have any guarantee that the chemicals used by the QEC to keep the grass at bay will not find its way onto his carrots or pumpkins? All of us have been made very conscious of what is happening with the use of chemicals, particularly in the international meat market. Not only do farmers lose control over their property, but they have no control over what the Queensland Electricity Commission may be doing with chemicals. That is one very real concern for quite a large number of the farming community. </PARA>

They expressed their very precise and very clear objections to the placement of the QEC east link through their area. They object not because they are necessarily opposed to the QEC east link&mdash;although people did raise issues as to whether this was necessary, and whether in fact the kind of electricity that would be generated in the link-up would be important&mdash;but because, if they are to survive as a community, they need that area to remain pristine.

Unfortunately, the dam is currently only operating at 9 per cent capacity, and we all hope and pray for a break in the drought. </PARA>

They believe that in this, the International Year of the Family, it is wrong that this very popular family area&mdash;where people can take their own lunch, have their children play and be very much part of a family situation&mdash;can have its playground equipment removed in the middle of the night because of certain financial constraints on government departments, and it is wrong that the kinds of maintenance and facilities needed are no longer available to families. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to use the consideration of the appropriation bills to review the state of the economy and where Australia might go. This is the appropriate occasion in the House for that kind of activity. The current situation of the economy is a delightful one, as has been said a number of times in the last day or two from this side of the House. The rate of economic growth is measured at 6.4 per cent and even if those figures have to be revised downward, as is possible because it seems extraordinarily rapid, it is quite clear that the economy is now growing very strongly, that the level of economic activity is high and that therefore there will a strong rate of economic growth and a strong rate of employment growth, which is what we all want.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal problem of the Australian economy at present is the level of unemployment. It has fallen significantly from its peak but it is still over 9 per cent, and we want that to come down rapidly and to remain much lower. One of the principal requirements for that is for the level of economic activity to remain strong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rate of inflation is also extraordinarily low. At less than two per cent, less than half the OECD average, that is less than half also the rate amongst our trading partners, and there is no significant sign of that rate of inflation increasing. It is quite clear too that business investment is growing strongly and that there is also strong growth in many exports. Of course, the drought is retarding growth of primary exports, which is a tragedy for the rural sector. The government has a package in place to try to offset that to a limited extent but the drought is containing the growth of the whole economy and, until the drought breaks, we will not see the uniform spread of economic activity that we want to see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given those situations and the fact that we still have a significant current account deficit, it is important to try to maximise growth of employment, to minimise the impact of that on the current account deficit and to minimise the impact of it on inflation. The question is how we do that, and it is not an easy policy balance to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all want to avoid increases in interest rates and taxation but, on the other hand, it is crucial to ensure that this recovery, this strong period of economic growth, is sustainable. That cannot happen if we go into a too rapid boom in a way that leads inevitably to a recession later on. So the question is what balance of policies the government and the Reserve Bank should use to ensure sustainability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people, particularly from the financial markets, have been arguing that interest rates should be increased yet again. I think they neglect the fact that, since the September quarter increase in the national accounts, there have already been two increases in interest rates, increases totalling one and 3/4per cent, the most recent of which was towards the end of October. It is quite clear that those increases would not have made any impact at all on the activity in the September quarter, and it is therefore appropriate to wait awhile before any further decision is made on interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the commentary from the financial markets suggests that the government and the Reserve Bank should act as if what is happening at this very moment, the beginning of December, is what was measured for the September quarter. That is an oversimplification. It is highly likely that the growth rate will remain strong now, but it may be somewhat less than it was measured to be in the September quarter, because of the impact of those two interest rate increases. It is quite clear, for example, that housing activity is already tailing off a bit. I know, from anecdotal evidence, of business people who have deferred investments that they were planning, because of the two increases in interest rates that have already occurred, and because they fear that there may be more in the pipeline and they fear the cost that those increases would cause them if they were to invest further now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think responsible policy would suggest that there should not be any further increases in interest rates for some time, until it is possible to accurately and comprehensively evaluate the impact of the two increases in interest rates that have already occurred, and the consequences of that impact for every part of the economy. It is important to do that, of course, in ways that take account not only of statistics but also of the evidence that comes from the business sector, the housing sector and the consumer sector, in so far as that can be assessed. Of course, since the Christmas period is always a period of very rapid activity&mdash;a turbulent period, if you like, in measured terms&mdash;it would be wise to leave further decisions until late January or February. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is good to see that the Reserve Bank has today decided not to announce any further increase. I hope that it will take no further action for at least a couple of months. One would hope that it would then find that further increases were not necessary. We want to avoid interest increases in so far as we possibly can, because they increase the cost of investment and they increase the cost to home buyers and buyers of white goods and cars, and we want the level of economic activity to remain as strong as is possible. One of the lessons of the last decade was that interest increases can be very damaging. That is the lesson, not only from Australia but also from other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, we want to be quite cautious about any increases that occur. The fact that increases are happening in the United States does not mean that they are appropriate policy here, not least because real interest rates in Australia are already&mdash;still&mdash;well above those in the United States, despite the fact that there have been half a dozen increases there. Because our inflation rate is so low, the real level of interest here is still high, by historical standards and by international standards. We ought to remember that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, we need to remember that when interest rates rise the exchange rate rises. That has happened in the months that have followed the increases in interest rates here. Increases in the exchange rate make adjustment of the current account deficit more difficult. For those reasons, as well as for the reason that we want employment growth to be maximised, we should be very cautious about any further increases in interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we have to find ways of containing demand. It seems entirely appropriate for the government to be seriously thinking about very modest, progressive increases in taxation. It is something new in the Australian environment, since the last decade and a half, for there to be serious consideration of what should be done about taxation. During the last decade we had a whole series of reductions in taxation, which were no doubt widely welcomed. But it is responsible, as the Treasurer said yesterday, to use taxation, as well as monetary policy and policy about outlays, as countercyclical policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a time when outlays have been severely constrained, when there are strong demands for improvements in education or health or welfare, or for spending on the arts, the environment or infrastructure, and those demands are entirely justified, it seems right to consider the possibility of using taxation as well as outlays as a countercyclical tool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question then for the government is how to do that. All of us would have our appropriate suggestions to make, but I would want to emphasise that the changes should be carefully targeted and should be progressive. In other words, they should be imposed on areas where people can more readily afford them; in other words, they should be imposed on high income earners rather than low income earners or middle income earners or perhaps on certain areas in the business sector where they will not discourage investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such areas are available. Let me mention just a couple. A very obvious area would be to halve dividend imputation. Australia is, I am told, perhaps the only country, but at the very least one of the few countries, with 100 per cent dividend imputation. Most countries in the OECD have half dividend imputation. That is a benefit, of course, only to those who own shares. By definition, that is principally those who are on upper incomes or the more wealthy. To halve dividend imputation would still give them some of the benefit of that policy but it would save about $900 million in revenue forgone. That would be an equitable measure. It would bring us into line with a lot of the rest of the Western world, and it would not discourage the purchase of shares. I think that that is a very serious possibility that ought to be considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another course which many people mention would be to do away with negative gearing. That too is a tax policy that is of benefit to those who are by definition relatively well off, who can benefit from the effect of their assets on their net income. I think a lot of people judge that abolition of negative gearing would be a progressive policy. Another possibility would be changes to some of the tax treatment of superannuation, particularly for very high income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other possibilities are available but those ones would be quite well targeted. They would be progressive policies which would not discourage investment, which would bring us into line with much of the rest of the Western world, which would not be discriminatory and which would be paid for by those who can most readily afford them. It is important to consider those possibilities, as well as the possibility of perhaps a higher marginal rate for people on over $70,000. There is nothing sacrosanct about the upper limit at present of $50,000. That too would make the income tax system rather more progressive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have explored these ideas with quite a lot of care in a book that I wrote with a friend at the Australian National University, John Quiggin, and we have done quite a bit of research on them. Therefore I make these suggestions on the basis of quite a bit of careful thought, and I hope that they will be considered by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by repeating that what is happening at present is in large measure the result of sound policy over the last few years. The economy is now growing strongly. The problems are the delightful ones of a strong recovery. The issues for the government are how to ensure that that recovery can be sustained so that employment can go on growing in the ways that we all want. Employment growth will occur mainly in the service sector, and a lot of it in the human service sector. To build up the revenue base allows some of that growth of employment to be in the area of publicly provided human services like education and health, areas where there are desperate needs for improvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The example that seems to me to be most powerful is that at the beginning of this year 140,000 people who applied to go to technical and further education colleges were not able to find places. Therefore, it is a very high priority to build up the number of places available so that those people can get the skills that they need for the working life that they want and so that Australia can have the benefit of a more skilled work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some of the additional revenue to be used for improvements in the number of TAFE places would be welcomed very widely in the community. Since TAFEs are the most widely underfunded areas of education, I think that is one of the highest priorities for use of any additional revenue that is available. No doubt, some of the additional revenue would rightly be used for reducing the deficit. It should also be used in ways that will maximise growth of employment, and the TAFE sector is a particularly good example. I conclude by reiterating the centrality of the employment goal and the need to ensure sustainable economic development in ways that will also include increased equity, which would in turn contribute to making the economy more humane and sustainable. </PARA>

<PARA>This bill, together with the two others that are part of the same package, is to replace the Audit Act 1901. That act is one of the few Commonwealth laws that have operated continuously since they were passed by this parliament in its first session after federation. Its intended replacement, therefore, represents something of a landmark in the history of Commonwealth financial administration. The Audit Act is not being replaced simply because it is old. In fact, it has proved remarkably robust over its 93-year life in providing for the procedural framework for Commonwealth financial administration and for the audit of the Commonwealth's activities. But too many of its basic concepts and structures reflect their 19th century origins to an extent that ignores and in some cases even impedes modern management practice and contemporary expectations for public sector accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These limitations were recognised by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in the course of its comprehensive inquiry into the operations of the Audit Office. In its report 296, tabled in April 1989, the JCPA recommended that the Audit Act be replaced with more modern legislation, with separate acts to deal with auditing and financial administration. In giving effect to that recommendation, the government believes that clarity would be served best through the adoption of three new acts. It is proposed that there be an Auditor-General Act to provide for the powers and functions of the Auditor-General. In relation to financial administration, however, Commonwealth bodies differ according to the basic legal financial status that each one has&mdash;namely, whether the body has the legal capacity, in its own right, to acquire ownership of money and other assets coming into its possession, or whether it acts only as a financial and custodial agent for the Commonwealth, without acquiring separate legal ownership of such money and assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, it is proposed that there be a Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act to specify certain matters that are to apply to the operations of financially autonomous bodies&mdash;that is, Commonwealth bodies that have legal ownership of money in their own right; and a Financial Management and Accountability Act, to apply to the financial operations of agencies&mdash;that is, Commonwealth bodies that financially are agents of the Commonwealth in that the bodies acquire no legal ownership of the money that they raise and spend. That money, in the constitutional sense, directly comprises the `Treasury of the Commonwealth'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, you may recall that, upon introduction of the package of these three bills on 29 June 1994, the House agreed that the legislative package be referred to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts for its consideration and advisory report. JCPA report 331 tabled on 22 September 1994 is the result of that process. I believe that the committee is to be commended for its quality analysis and recommendations, the great majority of which the government accepts. In that regard, I foreshadow that the government will be moving a number of amendments to the bills to pick up the recommendations of the JCPA accepted by the government, together with several other minor changes the desirability for which became evident as a consequence of reviewing the bills to address the JCPA's examination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now wish to provide an outline of the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Act. The proposed act is concerned with the regulatory-accounting-accountability framework for dealing with and managing the money and property of the Commonwealth. It will specify responsibilities and powers necessary for the efficient, effective and ethical use of the resources lawfully available to the Commonwealth to carry out its programs; and it will provide appropriate mechanisms to ensure that the stewardship and management performance of those who are responsible for those resources can be made visible and thereby allow them to be held accountable. The proposed law will add substance to the spirit of the public sector financial reforms that have been a feature of this government's administration over the last decade. At the same time, the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Act is intended to preserve the traditional strengths of the Audit Act's key principles of financial control and, where possible, to clarify and simplify them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum accompanying this bill deals comprehensively with its features. There are, however, a few elements that I would like to mention specifically. The definitions of `Agency', `Chief Executive', `official', `public money' and `public property', between them, describe the proposed boundaries of the act's application. Within those boundaries, the principles set down in the act will be fleshed out, where necessary, by subsidiary legislation&mdash;regulations and finance minister's orders&mdash;to provide procedural substance for the day-to-day application of those principles. Such a legislative framework is patterned on the structure established by the Audit Act for regulations and finance directions, except that, unlike finance directions, which are administrative in character, provision is made for finance minister's orders to be tabled as disallowable instruments. The legislative framework will be completed by instructions which chief executives will be authorised to issue to officials of their agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act will preserve the unique role of the Minister for Finance, which is central to the orderly functioning of the Commonwealth's financial administration. The finance minister is, for all practical purposes, the custodian of the constitutional `Treasury of the Commonwealth' so that the range of statutory powers and responsibilities for the proper custody of the Commonwealth's money is vested in that office. The finance minister will retain the sole power to agree appropriate banking arrangements for public money and to make orders concerning the handling of receipts and withdrawals of public money and its investment. The existing power under the Audit Act to arrange overdrafts and advances from banks has been clarified to specifically limit such arrangements as short-term cash management tools&mdash;overdrafts on operational bank accounts for up to 30 days; borrowings from banks as advances paid to the Commonwealth for up to 90 days; and other types of credit arrangements, to be prescribed by the regulations, such as those represented by credit card and cabcharge transactions, for up to 60 days. It should be noted that these arrangements confer no power for the Commonwealth to spend otherwise than as authorised by parliament through appropriations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most visible changes to be brought about by the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Act is in relation to the accounting classifications of money in the Commonwealth's possession. The trust fund established by section 60 of the Audit Act is to be abolished and replaced by two purpose based funds&mdash;the reserved money fund and the commercial activities fund. Apart from components of the reserved money fund that may be established pursuant to other enactments, the components of these two funds will be established or varied by finance minister's determinations. The effect of such determinations will be to specify the kinds of money that may be drawn from the consolidated revenue fund or loan fund and credited to the particular component and the purposes on which that money may then be spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the spending of money from such a fund is in all respects an appropriation, the proposed act will require that these determinations by the finance minister be tabled as disallowable instruments that do not take effect until the period for disallowance has passed. This procedure is more visible and provides a greater measure of parliamentary control than has traditionally been the case in the establishment of trust accounts under the Audit Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Payments of public money, including debiting a fund against an appropriation, will be controlled by a system of `drawing rights', to be issued by the finance minister. This system is predicated on the fact that the laws made by parliament relating to appropriations, variously compelling or permitting the executive government to spend, always specify the fund being appropriated and the purpose of the spending. Such laws may also specify an amount and a time frame. It would be a breach of section 83 of the constitution for spending to occur in any instance outside of those parameters, so the act will stipulate that the finance minister has no capacity to issue valid drawing rights that are inconsistent with the terms of the relevant appropriation law and will make it an indictable offence for an official or minister to knowingly spend, or seek to spend, otherwise than in accordance with a valid drawing right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act would create a standing appropriation out of which rewards could be paid in certain circumstances for information furnished that led to the apprehension of persons defrauding the Commonwealth. The government is serious about deterring and detecting fraud against the Commonwealth, and the potential for this measure to assist in that battle cannot be overlooked. Nevertheless, the government acknowledges the recommendation of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration in its report on the inquiry into fraud on the Commonwealth, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Focusing on fraud</EMPHASIS>, tabled in November 1993, that there be no such formal scheme of rewards. The response to that report, including that recommendation, is being considered by the government and will be announced shortly. Should it transpire that the government accepts the committee's recommendation, the government will move for this clause's removal from the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act would put into the principal legislation the powers that are presently carried only in finance regulations in relation to providing a source of authority for the Presiding Officers to approve expenditure under appropriations for parliamentary departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present Audit Act is generally silent on matters of management performance. The new act seeks to remedy this through particular responsibilities being expressly placed on chief executives of agencies for which they may then be held accountable. They are to be required to manage the affairs of their agencies efficiently, effectively and ethically to the extent allowed by law. They will also be required to implement fraud control plans and establish audit committees. The accountability mechanisms to mesh with these responsibilities will include powers of the finance minister to obtain financial statements and other reports more frequently than annually from agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, it is proposed that chief executives be permitted to subdelegate to officials any of the act's finance minister's powers or functions, unless the minister has imposed a restriction prohibiting or limiting such subdelegation. These arrangements for subdelegating are intended to achieve a major strengthening in the financial framework. Chief executives are better placed than the finance minister to manage, to monitor and to control the activities of those officials who perform the delegated tasks. It will thus be practicable to hold chief executives accountable to the finance minister in these respects, whereas it is currently quite impracticable to do so under the existing Audit Act's delegation structures where thousands of individual officials are directly delegated by the finance minister. The government believes that this proposed law represents a significant landmark in sharpening and strengthening the framework of Commonwealth financial administration. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the purposes of the bill, a `Commonwealth authority' is, in essence, one established by an act as a body corporate for a public purpose and which holds money on its own account. A `Commonwealth company' is one in which the Commonwealth has a direct controlling interest&mdash;that is, there is no interposed entity between the company and the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All Commonwealth companies will be subject to the requirement for the Auditor-General to report on their financial statements, and the financial statements of their subsidiaries, and for their annual reports to be tabled in the parliament. However, only `wholly-owned Commonwealth companies' are to be subject to the other provisions in the bill relating to companies. This reflects the difficulty&mdash;in the case of Commonwealth controlled companies which have private shareholders&mdash;of imposing a general regime which requires the provision of plans and reports only to ministers: namely, a risk of oppression actions under the Corporations Law by minority shareholders who might perceive discrimination against their interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now briefly outline the main provisions of the proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act. The annual report is seen as the centrepiece of directors' accountability to the parliament. The bill proposes that directors of Commonwealth authorities must prepare an annual report containing a report of operations, financial statements and a report by the Auditor-General on the financial statements. The report of operations and the financial statements must be prepared in accordance with finance minister's orders and the directors and the Auditor-General must certify whether, in their opinion, the financial statements give a `true and fair view' of the matters required to be reported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should mention that the proposed obligations on directors, as individuals, will replace more general obligations on authorities under existing arrangements. This approach is similar in principle to that applied to companies by the Corporations Law and is intended to clarify the accountability arrangements. I should also mention that the finance minister's orders will be disallowable instruments, thereby ensuring an ongoing role for the parliament in determining the reporting obligations of directors of Commonwealth authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The directors of both Commonwealth authorities and Commonwealth companies will be required to give the responsible minister a copy of their annual report, or annual general meeting documents, which the Minister must in turn table in each House of the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other reporting obligations proposed by this bill. The finance minister may require Commonwealth authorities and wholly owned companies to prepare half-yearly or quarterly financial statements. The statements must be given to the responsible minister within two months after the end of the period to which they relate and must be tabled in each House as soon as practicable. It is envisaged that this requirement to prepare interim financial statements will mainly be applied to bodies with a high degree of independence, such as government business enterprises&mdash;GBEs. Of course, as the government, from time to time, develops new approaches to providing the services now provided by GBEs, there may be a need to look again at how the proposed act will apply to those bodies. </PARA>

It proposes that the responsible minister may, after consulting with directors, notify them of general policies of the government that are capable of being applied to the authority or company concerned. The directors must ensure that such policies are carried out and, as far as practicable, ensure that they are also carried out in relation to any subsidiaries. Such policies cannot be in conflict with any statutory obligations of a particular authority or company.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with the government's response to a recommendation by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration in its 1989 report on government companies and their reporting requirements, the bill provides that a Commonwealth authority must ensure that none of its subsidiaries does anything that the authority itself does not have power to do. This does not, of course, preclude the parliament from passing legislation to empower a subsidiary to perform a particular activity that exceeds the powers of its parent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill imposes standards of conduct on executive officers of Commonwealth authorities broadly equivalent to the standards already imposed on executive officers of companies by the Corporations Law. Executive officers include directors and any other persons who are concerned in, or take part in, the management of the authority. Specifically, the bill provides that `executive officers' must at all times act honestly and exercise a reasonable degree of care and diligence in the exercise of their powers and the discharge of their duties. Also, an executive officer, or former executive officer, must not make improper use of inside information, or of his or her position as an executive officer, in order to gain an advantage for any person, either directly or indirectly, or cause detriment to the authority. Both criminal and civil sanctions are provided for contravention of these provisions. </PARA>

Performance audits are an extra feature on the accountability landscape peculiar to public sector bodies. It does not follow, however, that the often high parliamentary profile given the reports of such audits would always be beneficial to the interests of the companies' private investor/shareholders.

The bill proposes that the Auditor-General and authorised officials have full and free access to information, documents and premises.

Nevertheless, should the staff's existing skills and expertise need to be augmented from time to time, the bill also seeks to preserve the Auditor-General's flexibility to engage any person&mdash;for example, to contract with auditors from the private sector&mdash;to assist in the performance of an Auditor-General function.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill. This bill will enhance part 11 of the Audit Act 1901, which currently provides standard financial provisions for public authorities and certain other bodies. It will also replace individual financial provisions contained in the enabling legislation of authorities not subject to part 11. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill will provide a single set of core reporting and auditing requirements for directors of Commonwealth authorities and set out standards of conduct for executive officers. Many of these requirements are based on comparable Corporations Law as well as the best practice applying to individual authorities. The Auditor-General's mandate will be extended to all Commonwealth authorities and Commonwealth companies without exception, and this is how it should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The public has a right to expect that public businesses are following sound financial reporting. For too long there has been this hole in Commonwealth law. Commonwealth companies have been expected to act in a commercial sense or attain best practice but the auditing provisions have not been able to back this up. Of course, the best way to obtain best practice in government businesses is to expose them to competition from the private sector. Why should the taxpayer be sinking money into an enterprise which can most effectively be operated in the private sector?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where a Commonwealth business can operate in the commercial marketplace to the benefit of the economy, it should be allowed to do so. The marketplace will impose far greater discipline with lower cost and at lower prices than any amount of government tinkering and social engineering. This has at last dawned on the government and so they have stolen the coalition's principles in this area as well, albeit only to the extent allowed by its ACTU masters. As usual, the ALP's rhetoric far outstrips its actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Modern financial management and accounting principles are an important support to the principles of greater commercial practice. It is a truism, however, that merely updating financial requirements will not force companies to act commercially. Where possible, government businesses must be allowed to take their chances in the marketplace if consumers and the nation are to get maximum benefit from the policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Typically, however, the Labor Party has also bastardised this principle for petty political reasons. I refer, of course, to the government's spineless response to the Maritime Union thuggery and intimidation. Rather than rule in the interest of the nation, the government acted to protect and pay off its mates. Of course, the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) the minister for backflips, was only too happy to dip into the taxpayers' purse so that his union mates could have more comfort in the workplace. So much for exposing businesses and their work practice to competition in the market. But it does not stop there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The so-called privatisation program of the government is a farce. Privatisation is clearly the best way of exposing appropriate government business enterprises to full commercial reality. But this government could not sell heaters in the Arctic. On the Qantas float, it would be fair to say that the Minister for Finance, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley), is having trouble getting the nose wheel down for the sale. In the sorry saga of ANL, while the government is throwing taxpayers' money around and desperately trying to come up with a sale, ANL's finances are dead in the water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it really is not good enough to simply put out new legislation on accounting requirements. This must be backed up by active policies to expose Commonwealth companies to commercial pressure and best practice. But given that the Keating government has completely dropped the ball on micro-economic reform, there is little chance of the hard decisions being made. It is the Auditor-General's bill where the government has again dropped the ball. To be effective, the Auditor-General must be truly independent and answerable to the parliament, not the executive. The executive must not be able to apply pressure&mdash;either implicit or explicit&mdash;to gain a more agreeable finding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill improves the powers of the Auditor-General to gather information and ensure that taxpayers' interests are being looked after. It establishes the office of Auditor-General for the Commonwealth and sets the Auditor-General's functions. The Auditor-General will have new, stronger powers of entry and information gathering. The coalition fully endorses these new principles, but would prefer to put in place even stronger safeguards of the Auditor-General's independence. We believe in this because, unlike the government, the coalition has nothing to fear from an independent Auditor-General. The coalition believes that the people's representatives should have oversight of the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is correct to increase the financial and functional independence of the Auditor-General by providing independent powers of spending within the appropriation, we must do more to ensure that the Auditor-General is an instrument of the parliament. The coalition is strongly of the view that oversight of the Auditor-General should be done by an Audit Committee of the Parliament by modifying the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. This committee will be a permanent feature of the parliament; it will not exist as a whim of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government business enterprises are an important sector of the economy. They are frequently an important input to the economy. For this reason, they must be functioning efficiently and effectively. To assist in this, the coalition feels that they should be open to the scrutiny of the Auditor-General and, through that office, the parliament. The coalition will be moving an amendment to allow the Auditor-General to conduct performance audits of public enterprises wherever desired if there is significant or complete government ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General should not be constrained by ministerial veto or lower house votes.

If I ran a business as badly as this government clearly runs its businesses, I would not want an independent auditor dropping in and looking over my shoulder. You never know what inefficient practices might be hiding under various rocks. The government will of course say that if it is a GBE then it is operating in a commercial environment and does not need an independent auditor doing inconvenient performance audits. However, one only has to mention the letters ANL to bring this argument undone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I were a Labor minister who had just been party to handing out millions to prop up the long-term failure of an enterprise, I would stay well clear of that argument. There is clearly a need for performance audits and we will be proposing amendments to the bill accordingly. We are aware, however, that some GBEs have private sector holdings. To this end, the Audit Committee will be able to prevent random audits if it is satisfied that there is sufficient private sector involvement to impose market discipline on poorly performing GBEs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most important tasks is the selection of the Auditor-General. There must be no hint of political patronage or subversion of responsibilities to the Australian people. For this reason, the representatives of the Australian people must have a say in who is selected. The coalition will be moving an amendment that the Leader of the Opposition and the Audit Committee of the Parliament must also give their approval in selection. I do not mean consult with the Leader of the Opposition and the Audit Committee; I mean approval must be sought. Consultation can be an exchange of letters, which can later be discarded. I am sure the government would not want this and it is just an oversight on its behalf, but we have to be sure. This approval will ensure that all appointments are sound and non-political, as they should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General performs a most serious responsibility&mdash;that of ensuring that the funds and agencies of the Australian people are properly managed and maintained.  To this end, it is important that the Auditor-General be able to attract quality officers. For this reason, the coalition will be moving to allow the Auditor-General to have greater control over salaries and staff conditions. While the Auditor-General will have to heed the government's industrial relations policy, the Auditor-General should be able to offer competitive packages to attract and keep the best people. To an effective Auditor-General, the people themselves are the most important assets, and the Auditor-General must have the freedom to treat them accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel confident that the Australian people would wish to see a strong and effective Auditor-General so that the rorts can be dug out and exposed to scrutiny. It is this that the government runs from, like Dracula from light. With these bills it will once again be up to the coalition to finish the job. The government started but could not make the hard yards on the issues that matter to raise accountability to where it belongs. The coalition amendments will expose the shortfalls in this bill.

There are a number of issues which the member for Forrest raised, and which presumably members of the opposition generally will take up, with which I would have some sympathy. I was a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which had a look at that legislation as a result of a reference by the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), and I contributed towards a unanimous report from that committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

It was on a motion of the Minister for Finance himself that those three bills&mdash;in the sense of their being draft bills after they were introduced&mdash;were referred to the Public Accounts Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee consists of nine government members and six opposition members from both this House and the Senate.

Some of the deficiencies of those proposed amendments are in connection with the initial recommendations and proposals made by the Public Accounts Committee. I applaud this process of legislation being referred to committees of the parliament for detailed examination and for report back and recommendations to the minister and the government. There is, as far as government members are concerned, a difficulty associated with it. We were part of that report.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr ROBERT BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In view of that interjection, let me make this point: up until recent years, since 1901 when the Commonwealth was established, those people who have tended to monopolise national government in Australia, in the Commonwealth, have been members of the coalition. The Audit Act, which we are now in the process of replacing, was the fourth item of legislation enacted by the new Commonwealth government back in 1901. That legislation, which has undoubtedly had numerous amendments, has existed until now. It was this government which put into place not only this legislation but all of the processes which have led up to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are too often amused by some of the absurd positions which are adopted by the opposition. I mentioned in passing that the legislation was first enacted in 1901. As I said, there have been many amendments. To a very large extent, those amendments have sought to respond to changing circumstances. But this is the first comprehensive, overall review leading to the complete restructuring of the government's audit legislation. It is a complete, new, comprehensive, more appropriate and contemporary approach to the whole question of financial accountability within the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic reason for this legislation is that the present act, that act which has persisted with amendments since 1901, has become increasingly less able to accommodate the needs and the realities of the modern public sector. This inadequacy was recognised in the 1989 report of the Public Accounts Committee on the Auditor-General. That report recommended that the act be repealed and replaced with legislation which was more in tune with present day realities, which was more effective in addressing their needs and which allowed greater flexibility in the financial management of public sector operations. The government accepted that recommendation. This legislation is the result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Public Accounts Committee, as I indicated, became involved as a result of the Minister for Finance referring the legislation to it on 29 June this year. On that same day, as a result of a motion in the Senate, the Public Accounts Committee had referred to it the question of the establishment of an audit committee. As a result of both of those references to the Public Accounts Committee we now have this very comprehensive report&mdash;report 331&mdash;of the Public Accounts Committee. The committee tabled its report on 22 September. The government has considered that report. This legislation represents a modification of the initial legislation as a result of many of those recommendations made by the Public Accounts Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This package comprises three bills: the Financial Management and Accountability Bill, referred to generally now as the FMA Bill; the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill, referred to more generally as the CAC Bill; and the Auditor-General Bill. The general construction of this legislation was referred to in some detail by the Minister for Finance in his second reading speech. But let me refer very briefly by way of background to the essence of this legislation. The FMA Bill, for example, establishes appropriate arrangements for financial management and accountability within Commonwealth agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the purpose of the legislation, Commonwealth agencies are those departments and statutory authorities whose enabling legislation does not give them legal ownership of money or property separate from the Commonwealth. Those Commonwealth authorities and companies which do legally own money or property on their own account are those which have been picked up in the CAC Bill. That legislation has been necessary in particular to draw together, to coordinate and to integrate all of the existing provisions which are scattered through diverse and disparate sources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation is designed to make consistent and explicit the accountability requirements for each type of Commonwealth entity. The Auditor-General Bill&mdash;and this is the legislation to which most attention is being given by the government and by way of amendments proposed by the opposition&mdash;is a very comprehensive piece of legislation. It not only establishes the offices of the Auditor-General and the Independent Auditor but also describes their powers and, as the minister indicated in his second reading speech, it establishes the Australian National Audit Office as a statutory authority to provide resources and support services to the Auditor-General in the carrying out of the responsibilities which he has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note the comments the member for Forrest made about accountability and whether or not the government's conduct in relation to these bills has been adequate. During the inquiry which the Public Accounts Committee undertook it had occasion to deal with a letter written in response to an approach by the PAC to the Secretary to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Dr Keating. Dr Keating concluded his letter by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is difficult to think of any Bills which have been subject to longer and more extensive consultation before being presented to the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no way that the claims of the kind that the member for Forrest has made can, in any real sense, be substantiated. I will now refer to the background to the reference of those three bills to the Public Accounts Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Procedure Committee in its report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">About time</EMPHASIS> referred to old standing order 221 which permitted bills of the parliament to be referred to a select committee following their second reading. No bills had ever been referred under that provision, although the standing orders had been suspended on occasions to refer a bill to a joint select committee immediately following the minister's second reading speech. The Procedure Committee considered that a procedural mechanism to permit a bill to be referred to a standing committee needed to be provided formally in the standing orders and it made an appropriate recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That recommendation has been picked up in new standing order 217A. That particular provision provides a more effective mechanism by which legislation can be referred to committees. Since that special provision was made a number of bills have been referred to committees. For example, on 4 May a bill was referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, on 11 May a bill was referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, on 7 June a bill was referred to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, on 29 June this package of three bills was referred to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and on 25 August the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) referred the Employment Services Bill 1994 to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, what we have done is introduce, where necessary and appropriate, a new process into the legislative continuum&mdash;the initiation of legislation, the preparation of legislation, the work of Parliamentary Counsel, the political party processes, cabinet consideration and so on. Another stage has been introduced as a result of these changes. I referred to this earlier when I said I welcomed and applauded the change. I think it has been a very desirable change. The effectiveness of that process is reflected not only in the very effective way in which the Public Accounts Committee gave consideration to these three bills but also in the quality of report which it brought down and now, the final stage in this process, the fact that the government has responded favourably to so many of the proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was an undertaking given by the Minister for Finance when he moved the motion to refer the legislation to the Public Accounts Committee. Referring to the three bills, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These bills, like few others, will ultimately have an impact on the entire field of government activity, simply because almost every action of the government has a financial implication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The JCPA was the body which initiated action to replace the Audit Act and the government believes that it should be the body to formally examine, in the first instance and on behalf of the parliament, the proposed outcome of this action.</PARA>
<PARA>He concluded with a statement which really underlines the sincerity with which the government adopted this process. The minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have indicated, virtually by implication in the things that I have been saying, the government is not so proud of its authorship in this regard that it is going to take umbrage at getting additional advice from any sources and we look forward to the consultative processes yet in hand.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the way in which the government has responded to that report indicates that that was not an idle statement by the Minister for Finance. It is one which the Minister for Finance quite clearly has honoured by the way he has responded to that report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned that the opposition was taking up some of the particular items of the Public Accounts Committee report in connection with what it had identified as some of the more important elements of the legislation. Certainly as far as the Auditor-General legislation was concerned, I would agree that they are some of the more significant. The particular recommendations from the Public Accounts Committee report that are picked up in these issues are recommendations 19 and 20, both of which are concerned with the capacity of the Auditor-General to conduct performance audits of GBEs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition proposes with its amendment to allow the Auditor-General to at any time conduct a performance audit of a Commonwealth authority or company. If that amendment were successful, the Auditor-General would then have unilateral power to decide whether or not those performance audits would be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision the government has is that the performance audits be undertaken by the Auditor-General in two circumstances: first, if there is a request made by the responsible minister; or, second, if there is a resolution of both houses of parliament. I do not believe that is unduly restrictive. I do not think there would be any difficulty, in the case of a good relationship existing between the Minister for Finance and the Auditor-General, as there should be, with the Auditor-General, if he or she were to become aware of any inadequacies which would appear to justify a performance audit, having some discussion with the responsible minister in connection with any other government authority, agency or entity and seeking that request. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us be clear about this. If in a situation of that kind it became apparent to the Auditor-General that some sort of performance audit was necessary or desirable and a request was made to the minister for the request to go back to the Auditor-General, the minister would need good grounds to knock that back. The whole question of public accountability and public transparency in relation to issues of that kind indicates that any minister who sought to refuse a request of that kind would be very foolish indeed if the grounds for the request were clearly sufficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 28 of the Public Accounts Committee report is concerned with the conditions under which staff of the audit office should be employed. The suggestion has been made&mdash;this has also been picked up by one of the proposed amendments of the opposition&mdash;that it should be withdrawn from the Public Service Act provisions and that the Auditor-General should have the power to negotiate the terms and conditions under which he or she employs staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That certainly would provide the Auditor-General with greater management flexibility. It would perhaps also provide the Auditor-General with the opportunity to attract and keep the necessary staff. I have not yet seen within the Auditor-General's office where this does not exist. I have never seen any significant deficiency in the operation of that office. It has an enormous and a very effective output. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 33 concerns the appointment of the Auditor-General. The recommendation was that approval should be sought from the Leader of the Opposition or his or her representative, the Public Accounts Committee and the Audit Committee. The appointment of auditors-general has always been transparent. I have not noticed people making any claims in Australia that the appointments have been deficient. These are matters which can be revisited from time to time, but again I do not believe it is a matter of very great substance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And he is ratting on the committee whose recommendations he should uphold and endorse. Let us look at the detail of the way in which this works. An independent auditor is the only protection the parliament and the people of Australia have against the government departments doing the wrong thing. We are ultimately responsible for their actions. Our servant, the Auditor-General&mdash;an independent person&mdash;has the function of examining the accounts of all of these departments, and he should have that function.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can we discharge our responsibility here in this parliament if the Auditor-General is not free of ministerial control? He reports to the parliament, goes to those great departments and examines not only whether their adding and subtracting are right but also whether the efficiency of their programs is right. We need to have that. In part, you are denying that process by going against a report that you yourself signed. An independent auditor is a great protection for the citizens of this nation against the abuse of government departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On many occasions members of the Public Accounts Committee have sat aghast as somebody appearing before the committee has explained a misinterpretation of the administration of public funds, and on occasion members of the Public Accounts Committee have disclosed the misallocation of funds to the point of fraud. The Public Accounts Committee and the Auditor-General are protections for the Australian people. We have stopped fraud, we have prevented the abuse of funds, and saved the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in this process. I would have thought that you would see that today and say, `Yes, we really want to have a refinement of that independence of the auditor.' I would have thought that you would have endorsed the recommendations of your own report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other great truth of this process is that not only is the independence of the auditor critical but also we must have a process where ministers and departments are answerable to somebody. It is no good ministers just going into the cabinet room and being responsible to the Prime Minister. We as parliamentarians have a responsibility to our electors to see that ministers and their departments administer funds properly. The policy items and the political processes are a matter for debate&mdash;that is fair enough&mdash;but when it comes to the expenditure of public moneys and the way in which they are used ministers need to be squeaky clean and be answerable to the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On those two grounds, I think this is an important report and an important response. The government has failed to fully demonstrate its understanding of the need for an independent audit office and of the role of the Public Accounts Committee. If the Public Accounts Committee and the auditor are used properly, they are great tools for governments to be able to disclose misallocation of funds and inappropriate administration. It is a strengthening tool for government to be able to use the Auditor-General and the Public Accounts Committee. No minister should be ashamed of sending something off to the Auditor-General, because that enables the electorate to gain confidence that the right thing is being done. So I cannot understand why the minister is chary about pursuing the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I only have to give the House one recent example of the necessity of this process. In the last 24 hours we have had in the House two ministers trying to defend the administration of the Child Support Agency and the terrible mess and abuse that its examination by one of the parliamentary committees disclosed. Those ministers would be far better off saying: `Why not have the inquiry adopted by the parliament?' That is the way it should work. This is the tradition of the great Public Accounts Committee stretching back decades to Henry Bland, who founded it. It goes right back to that time. You are leaving a tradition that you should not walk away from. </PARA>

Let me outline some of the problems that the member disclosed in his speech where he sought to say, `The committee is right but I am going to support the government.' Recommendation No. 33 of the committee says that before making a recommendation to the Governor-General the minister must seek the approval of the following: the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives or his or her nominee, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and an audit committee of the parliament. That is a reasonable thing. That sets that person in the confident position that he or she has the endorsement of the whole parliament, both sides of the House, and there is no political game playing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a very sensible recommendation endorsed by all parties. It goes to the nub, the very reason, of why we have an independent auditor. Here we have carried it one step further so that the parliament can agree through the political processes to the name of that person. That is one of the processes the government has chosen to reject. Is it because there is a difference of opinion between Mr Taylor and the Minister for Finance, or the Department of Finance? Is it because the minister himself has decided that he does not want an independent auditor, that he wants to be able to put his finger upon the person who becomes the Auditor-General? Is that the reason why the minister will not agree to the committee's recommendations? Why has the minister chosen to ignore this recommendation?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Bolitho's current comments are largely a rehash of his media statements of 16 September. The variation being that he invokes the Auditor-General's report, tabled on Monday, as supporting his position. It does no such thing, as even the most perfunctory reading of the report would make clear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to valuations of ANL, which was the central matter in Mr Bolitho's statements, the report makes clear the different bases for the various figures that have been bandied about. The report clearly states that the financial statements, such as ANL's 1992-93 accounts, do not purport to be a valuation of the company and the amount shown as equity does not purport to be an indication of the net value of the entity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key finding of the report is that `there is no necessary inconsistency between the audited 1992-93 financial statements and the August 1994 Price Waterhouse-Salomon Brothers report', which hardly supports Mr Bolitho's views. Mr Bolitho has also artificially set ANAO's confirmation that ANL was a going concern for the purpose of its 1992-93 accounts against the negative valuation put on it by Price Waterhouse-Salomon Brothers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That misses these very important points. The ANAO states that financial statements prepared on a going concern basis do not purport to be the actual value of the entity at that point in time, even as a going concern. The audit office assessment of a going concern was largely predicated on an undrawn credit facility of $75 million, which was underpinned by a perception of government support: that is, government ownership was crucial in the positive book value of ANL.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Price Waterhouse-Salomon Brothers had a very different starting point. They started from the premise that the government wished to sell a substantial part of ANL. Based on their extensive consideration of a number of factors, including ANL's operating environment, poor operating performance and forecasts, they took the view that even if the government resumed a net debt of $180 million of ANL, as would most likely be required by any prospective purchaser, a partial or total trade sale or flotation of ANL was not viable in view of the fact that, even without financing costs, ANL's prospects were bleak.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While favouring an informal liquidation, they canvassed other options such as retention, which they deemed likely to involve major expense on the government's part, and restructuring with a view to a future trade sale as well as suggesting that further study be undertaken. In effect, the government assigned the task of further study to the current ANL board, whose task it is to restructure ANL as a viable entity. I note in passing that the shadow minister for transport said on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> this morning:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The head of the Department of Finance asked the Auditor-General to water down the criticisms the Auditor-General was making about the way this whole business of the sale of ANL has been handled.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to refer to `very serious accusations being made by the Auditor-General himself'. There have also been other references by journalists to criticisms in the report of the actions of public officials.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, there are no criticisms or accusations, serious or otherwise, made by the Auditor-General in his report at all. This is the very point which the Secretary to Finance took up with the Auditor-General in his letter to him of last Friday evening. The fact that the general observations of principle, made by the Auditor-General in his report, have been misconstrued amply demonstrates the basis of the concern of the Secretary to Finance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the record, I have no basis on which to question the discretion of public officials who advised the government on this matter.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5T4">Mr BRERETON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The impact of noise at Kingsford Smith airport is very sadly, I must say, consistent with the environmental impact study that was carried out, to which the Prime Minister referred in this House earlier this week, which indicated that, whilst 182,000 people were formerly affected by moderate or severe noise nuisance, under the new arrangements the number of 95,000 is much lower. That said, the fact is that one must feel very intensely for the 95,000 or so people who are at the moment experiencing the impact of the construction of the parallel runway. It is for that reason that cabinet will be considering, in the next day or so, a range of measures to tackle the question of alleviating this nuisance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be appropriate if I indicate to the House the sequence of events in respect of the timing of the opening of the parallel runway. On 1 February, which was right at the very start of my time as Minister for Transport, I wrote to the Chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority seeking advice on the best means to further improve safety at Sydney airport. I did so, against the backdrop of real concerns that had been expressed about the simops arrangements at Kingsford Smith&mdash;that is, the simultaneous take-offs and landings arrangements&mdash;which, of course, from a safety point of view, are not as optimum as parallel runways. That letter was prompted by concerns that had been put to me about the relative safety of simultaneous runway operations being used at that time in comparison with other possible methods of operating the airport. The Civil Aviation Authority wrote back to me on 15 February proposing a phased introduction of operations on the new parallel runway system to take advantage of the expected early completion of the new runway by the Federal Airports Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that advice to me on 15 February, the Civil Aviation Authority advised that operations could commence as early as September 1994, which is when it anticipated the new runway would be completed, by controlling traffic from the existing control tower, although there would be an initial slight fall in peak hour capacity. With the use of parallel runways, Sydney airport no longer requires the extensive use of simultaneous runway operations. Therefore, an already safe airport becomes that much safer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was the backdrop to the timing of the opening. On the interim basis of the runway, the operations have very little impact as far as noise nuisance is concerned for the most affected people&mdash;the residents living in the corridor to the north of the airport&mdash;who are bearing the burden of the increased traffic. They bear that burden because, in the last month since operations commenced, some 30 plus per cent of take-offs have been to the north as a result of prevailing winds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the wind blows at more than five knots apparent north, for safety considerations, planes need to take-off into that wind. Some planes can handle it better than others, but the fact is that the airport has to revert to northern take-offs to suit some classes of planes, and that of necessity means that all planes have to take-off to the north in those circumstances. That has resulted in a very real impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is no different from the impact that will exist when the new tower opens in February or March next year. In respect of the new parallel runway, there are no take-offs to the north under the environmental impact statement. We are now seeing take-offs to the north, which is a noise nuisance factor of about double that of landings, principally brought on by the wind considerations at Kingsford Smith. That will not change at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That somehow people are being exposed to greater noise nuisance than they should as a result of the airport being opened before the control tower is a total furphy. The fact is that a lot of planes have deviated from the flight paths in the last month. Lots of concerns have been very gravely expressed about the number of take-offs to the north, which is the very issue that cabinet will be addressing in the next day or so.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5T4">Mr BRERETON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the National Party asks whether the full length of the east-west runway will be available. Let me make it very clear to him and to the House that the east-west runway is available for those situations when there is too much cross-wind to operate the parallel runways. That is the case now, and will continue to be the case in the future. Let us be quite clear about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the first five days of operations of the new airport arrangements after the parallel runway was opened, because of exceptional westerly winds which prevailed in Sydney and, indeed, right across New South Wales at that time, the east-west runway was used exclusively. For those first five days, the burden of noise was overwhelmingly carried by people in the east-west corridor. That will be the case whenever that runway is required for operational reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, it needs to be understood that in those circumstances only one runway is being operated, and operating one runway drops the capacity of the airport down to 30 to 40 take-offs and landings per hour. The big problem facing Kingsford Smith airport at the moment is the tremendous expansion in demand for its services during the peak periods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been stated by the Civil Aviation Authority that, between February and November this year, the demand for take-offs and landings at Kingsford Smith airport during the peak hours on the peak days has gone up by 50 per cent. With that unbridled demand in the peak hours on the peak days, the whole of the additional capacity at Kingsford Smith will readily be swamped. Indeed, there will be very extensive queuing and circling when the east-west runway is the only runway available as a result of safety considerations brought on by wind factors.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Paterson for his question. Indeed, very good progress has been made. Today I have been informed that next week South Australia will move to fast-track award by award the training wage in that state. The House would be aware that, under the federal system, the national training wage was ratified by the federal commission as far back as 4 September. But what has been required is a mirroring of it in the states. With the South Australian operation in place, we will have effectively mirrored it in the states of South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. Tasmania has also legislated to give effect to it. This leaves Western Australia alone in not taking steps to secure the wage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The training wage that we have introduced is not the cut-price, punitive, training-in-name-only wage that was proposed by the opposition at the last election. This is a genuinely award based rate. It is linked to a national training framework. It is industry responsive and supported by industry. I also remind the House that, whatever uncertainty people might think surrounds wages in the current environment, there is no uncertainty under the training wage because these rates have been set for 12 months. Anyone taken on under a traineeship arrangement incorporating the training wage is exempt from the unfair dismissal provisions of the IR act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As important as this progress has been, it is not the training wage alone that will help us secure the new training places.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RE4">Mr BILNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. It is the case, as members will know, that each year there is a range of discussions between Papua New Guinean and Australian ministers, generally involving half a dozen ministers from each side, alternately in Papua New Guinea and in Australia. That annual PNG-Australia Ministerial Forum took place in Melbourne last Thursday and Friday. Among the wide range of matters discussed was the future of our aid program. That is a very important strand of our relationship with PNG and, given the crucial economic problems&mdash;I think it is fair to describe them in that way&mdash;PNG is facing, it was a very timely discussion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on the Australian side take the view that, in view of the fiscal and foreign exchange problems PNG is facing, which have led to the floating of the currency in PNG, amongst other things, there is simply no alternative to the PNG government negotiating and, importantly, then implementing a reform package with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. We think that should take place as soon as possible. Indeed, during those meetings we had assurances that the discussions with the World Bank would continue in January.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context, an international support package is being talked about, but the figure&mdash;I see there were some references in the reports, which the honourable member referred to, to a figure&mdash;is still something that needs to be assessed. We made the point very firmly that any Australian support for an economic reform package to Papua New Guinea is dependent on Papua New Guinea negotiating a satisfactory agreement with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and, as well as that, on Papua New Guinea itself undertaking significant economic reforms. Two of those reforms are improving its own collection of revenue and increasing public investment from its budget. I emphasise that Australia's participation in that package would be most unlikely to involve any new or additional aid to Papua New Guinea, over and above the amounts which we are committed to supplying under the treaty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as our current aid program to Papua New Guinea is concerned, things are going well. Our budget support is being progressively replaced with much needed public investment programs, particularly in the areas nominated by Papua New Guinea of infrastructure, health and education. We also agreed during the discussions with Papua New Guinea that there would be full transparency in how those aid programs were progressing and that we would find ways of increasing the flow of public information. It was agreed that the review of the treaty of development cooperation, due to be conducted in September 1995, would proceed and that that review would consider matters including Papua New Guinea's economic situation, the implications of the World Bank-International Monetary Fund adjustment programs and progress in implementing Australia's programmed aid. It was also agreed that planning for the review would commence shortly and that a working group would start meeting by April.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of the discussions, I was happy to be able to announce an $11 million project to assist sustainable forestry in Papua New Guinea, a matter of some concern in Australia as well. The project will improve education of forestry personnel and assist Papua New Guinea in the monitoring of logging activities. In announcing that, I urged Papua New Guinea to ensure that appropriate sustainable forest policies were implemented in line with the outcomes of the South Pacific Forum meeting in Brisbane. One move in that context would be to increase the level of export taxes on logs to improve the returns of logging to Papua New Guinea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I was able to present Papua New Guinea ministers with a report prepared by AIDAB on the damage to public infrastructure following the volcanic eruptions in Rabaul. That information will help them make the necessary decisions on the restoration or relocation of facilities in East New Britain and I believe it will be most valuable in that context.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. On Monday this week I, on behalf of the government, received the report on the review of the pensions income and assets test conducted by the independent consultant Ageing Agendas, which has worked on this matter over a considerable period together with a very broadly representative reference group of retiree organisations, the finance industry and relevant government departments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think its report was a good, solid piece of work, which flowed out of a thorough consultation process, and it was very comprehensive in its review of the issues. It has put forward some 50 recommendations that will be considered in a budget context, and we will be developing a considered response to the report next year in that context. There is one recommendation in the report that, I can indicate, the government will be accepting now, and that is that the government maintain a targeted approach to pension provision. The alternative to that, which has been espoused by some, is the so-called universal pension, which in effect means paying pensions to everybody, irrespective of any assets or income test; in other words, completely removing any means testing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As anybody who is remotely honest concedes, the reality is that that is simply unaffordable. We are talking about a cost of some $5 billion a year arising from removing all income and assets testing on pensions. It is also inequitable, and this has been confirmed in a study of the proposals by the retirement income modelling task force, which is a group of officials from Treasury, Finance and Social Security. Not only is it unaffordable; it is inequitable in its impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Contrary to the claims of the member for Berowra, proposals in this area were properly considered by the review. Just because a proposal is rejected does not mean that it was not properly considered. The honourable member for Berowra tries to have two-bob each way. A press release put out on the day said that he has an open mind on universal pension, saying that he will `continue to examine any proposals for a universal pension'. What profound dishonesty that is! This is the party that persistently criticises us for not making enough progress in cutting the deficit yet it criticises any suggestion that taxes might rise or that a government might increase its revenue. This is the party that says it has an open mind on a proposition that would have an annual budgetary impact of $5 billion. This is the sort of dishonesty that we get.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some reference to a proposal by the Institute of Actuaries. That proposal has been looked at by the retirement income modelling task force that I made reference to earlier. The institute attempts to fund the proposal by cutting the base rate of pension by $7&mdash;is that what the honourable member for Berowra proposes?&mdash;by freezing the superannuation guarantee charge; by more rapidly increasing the pension age for women, with further increases for both men and women in future; and by changing superannuation tax concessions. RIM suggests that by 2003 around $3 billion of national savings would be lost each year as a consequence of doing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Berowra also referred in his press release to the possibility of taxing the pension benefit which, as far as I can see, can only mean abolishing the pension rebate, the effect of which would be a cut of $11.40 per week for single pensioners. These are the sorts of things that you have to do to make a universal pension cost-effective, to use the honourable member for Berowra's terms. He knows full well that there is not the slightest chance in the world that a government of which he was a member would introduce such an arrangement. There is not the slightest possibility of that, and he knows it. He ought not to be dragging these sorts of propositions before the electorate in what I say is this thoroughly dishonest way.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the biggest stevedoring outfit in Australia. It is an outfit in which ANL has a 25 per cent shareholding. It was Mr Bolitho's wish that the government under deadlock-breaking provisions which he had negotiated with the other two shareholders, Howard Smith and Jamieson Equities, Mr Corrigan's outfit, should proceed to go from 25 per cent to 100 per cent ownership. That was, as I characterised in this House, a $280 million ask because, firstly, you had to buy Howard Smith for $28 million using your pre-emptive rights, then you had to be prepared to go into the auction with Corrigan and buy him out for at least the same amount of money, and then you had to take on the whole capital expenditure program that is in their three-year business plan. And on top of all of that you had one other responsibility, which was to assume the debt of Australian Stevedores.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The end result of that was $280 million of further taxpayer commitment to Australian Stevedores. What for? So that we, the government, could nationalise and run the biggest, greatest stevedoring company in Australia. I think the cabinet made a very sound decision. It was not my decision; it was a decision finally taken by a subcommittee of cabinet comprising the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance and me.

We either had to buy for $280 million or sell our quarter share. Let me remind the House&mdash;because these little urban myths have a habit of being perpetuated by one or other of the players in this&mdash;that the five-day maritime dispute came about as a result of the unions attempting to force the government to commit the taxpayer for the $280 million. The government, to its credit, said that it would not be forced to follow that course of action. Instead, the strike commenced at noon on the Thursday and on the Friday afternoon we disposed of our 25 per cent.</PARA>

We all remember the reputation that this man had as the minister for public works in New South Wales. We will all remember the problems that the Wran-Unsworth government had in its dying days. Honourable members will remember the former Premier of New South Wales Barrie Unsworth, the old cardigan killer. Many people thought he was not all that bright.

When Barrie Unsworth got rid of him it was too late, the damage was done. I think you will find that, unless this minister is prepared to have his head put on the plate, what the Minister for Transport did to Barrie Unsworth in 1988 is what he is going to do to Bob Carr in 1995. You just watch.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lot of controversy surrounding the Minister for Transport. He is a bit like a lightning rod for attracting controversy. Whether it be in the portfolio of industrial relations, whether it be his handling of the third runway controversy and all of the surrounding noise problems in Sydney, whether it be the handling of ANL or, indeed, the handling of aviation safety, this minister has got himself into hot water&mdash;on each and every one of those issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today in the House we saw how the minister and his colleague the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) were trying to deal with the problem of ANL. Many of us would have watched the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> last night to see the former chairman of ANL, Bill Bolitho, go on national television and make some very serious accusations about the way in which this minister has carried out his ministerial responsibilities as far as the privatisation and sale of ANL are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Bill Bolitho, a man whose reputation is unsullied throughout the business community and who is probably the most respected person in the Australian shipping industry today, went on national television and made some extraordinary and serious accusations about the propriety of the way in which this minister has carried out the sale and privatisation process of ANL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During this week, we also saw the Auditor-General's report being tabled in the Senate. What did the Auditor-General's report tell us? It told us three things. Firstly, it drew some very serious questions about the process by which the Price Waterhouse-Salomon Brothers report on, and valuation of, ANL was undertaken. The importance of that report on, and valuation of, ANL is that the Minister for Transport based all of his actions surrounding his decisions with ANL on that report. Yet the Auditor-General, in his report tabled in this parliament during the week, draws into question the whole process of the Price Waterhouse-Salomon Brothers valuation mechanism for the ANL. That is the first thing the report tells us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the Auditor-General in his report makes the point that he has been very concerned about certain public officials making public utterances which have the potential to damage the value of ANL. We heard earlier today the Minister for Finance trying to tell us that this was not directed in any way at the Minister for Transport. Yet the Minister for Transport got up here a little while later and said that the only thing in the Auditor-General's report he was worrying about was the gratuitous advice that had been levelled at him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do you know what the Auditor-General was saying? The Auditor-General was saying that the big mouth of the Minister for Transport has cost this country tens of millions of dollars. Why? Because he gave a press conference on national television and said, `You could not give ANL away.' We are in the business of trying to sell ANL. It is a business that is worth many millions of dollars. Yet this man went out and said that we could not give it away. In the process of doing that, he damaged the value of that business irreparably. That is the second thing the Auditor-General's report tells us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that, the Auditor-General attached an addendum to his report&mdash;a rather unusual thing for him to do. It is a letter from the Secretary to the Department of Finance&mdash;no doubt at the instruction of the Minister for Finance&mdash;requesting that the Auditor-General alter some key paragraphs in his report which are implicitly critical of the comments of the Minister for Transport about the value of ANL. That is what this letter is all about. It was unusual for the Auditor-General to do that&mdash;but necessary because he felt that, unless he made it quite clear that an attempt had been made to try to whitewash this report, people would not note the gravity of the situation surrounding this whole process of trying to sell ANL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The net result of this is that it has cost us a lot of money. So far it has cost us $20 million to fix up the strike of the Maritime Union of Australia which was created by this gentleman in the process of his handling of ANL. In addition to that, it will cost us more. We have already heard that next year we will have to have written into the budget an extra $50 million to try to keep this business that this man has now taken full charge of afloat for another 12 months. We also see that it will cost us money because of the big mouth this man has got. The views he has expressed, which he thinks are important, such as that ANL could not be given away, have cost the taxpayers of Australia a tremendous amount of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, Bill Bolitho made some extraordinary claims on the television last night. Over the last few weeks, we have also had several articles written by Laura Tingle. The minister referred to them in his comments today in question time. Those articles by Laura Tingle go to the whole propriety of this government. They refer to a secret loan of $22.4 million given by the company that this minister claims is bankrupt and that you could not give away to the company that was buying ANL's shares in Australian Stevedores. Yet today we heard the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Transport saying, `This was not a loan; this was just a deferred payment. It was exactly the same deal that Howard Smith had with Jamison Equity when it sold its 25 per cent shareholding in Australian Stevedores.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me tell you that it was not the same deal and the minister knows that. In fact, he knows it very well. The Australian Stevedores shares that Howard Smith owned were not handed over straightaway to Jamison Equity. It did not lend Jamison Equity the money. This government with its secret deal, which Laura Tingle has highlighted to us, actually gave a $22.4 million loan to Jamison Equity, handed over all the shares and gave the seat on the board of Australian Stevedores that ANL had directly to Jamison Equity. None of this was done by Howard Smith. There is a clear and distinct difference. This government would have us believe that the deal that it did with Jamison Equity was exactly the same deal that Howard Smith did. It was not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night I had dinner with some people who were present at the finalisation of the sale of the Australian Stevedores shares to Jamison Equity. They told me that everything Laura Tingle wrote in that article is absolutely and utterly true. That makes some of things that this minister and the Minister for Finance have said over the last few days quite wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have these quite reasonable and proper concerns about the propriety of this government and the administration by this minister of his ministerial responsibilities. These are serious concerns. If the Prime Minister does not deal with these sorts of concerns, Australia's taxpayers will continue to lose many millions of dollars due to the incompetence of this man. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the process of trying to cover up his actions over ANL, the minister has worn the tag that he justly deserves and that is of being the champion deceiver. This man is the champion deceiver. We heard the term used in this House earlier this week, but nobody better fits the term of champion deceiver than the Minister for Transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When talking about the champion deceiver, let us look at the third runway and the problems that Sydneysiders are experiencing at the present time. We have heard from this minister that we cannot have the east-west runway up and running again because it would be unsafe. Do you know the reason why the east-west runway is not going to be up and running again? It is not because it is unsafe. It has nothing to do with that at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we go back to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 23 March 1989 we find a detailed account of how the government changed its mind about the third runway; and who was responsible for changing the government's mind about the third runway. The article, which was written by Geoff Kitney, makes interesting reading. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After looking at various configurations, Mr Keating proposed that the new north-south runway be fully operational from both directions and the old east-west runway be virtually made redundant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of this change was dramatic.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the reason why the east-west runway is not being opened now. The significance of that is that the 10,000 people who rallied at Leichhardt Oval last Saturday expressing their concerns about the problems of noise over Sydney due to the opening of the third runway are saying that one of the best solutions to the problem is to open the east-west runway. We are not going to get it opened because the Prime Minister was the man who directed that it be closed. The reason why it was closed was explained further on in the same article. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The political significance of Mr Keating's proposal was that the noise impact on the most marginal Labor seats of Barton (1.1 per cent) and St George (3.7 per cent) would be greatly reduced, while the areas where noise would increase would be the safest Labor seats&mdash;Sydney (20 per cent) and Grayndler (10 per cent).</PARA>
<PARA>We now know why we have all these problems over Sydney with the third runway. It has nothing to do with the east-west runway operating simultaneously with the other two north-south runways being unsafe. It is all about grubby politics&mdash;politics designed to advantage nobody else but the Labor Party. The man responsible for it is the Prime Minister. But the man who is covering for him, the champion deceiver, is going around trying to convince us that we cannot have this east-west runway up and running because it would be unsafe. This is yet another example of the way in which this minister is not honestly and properly administering his portfolio responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing that earns him the title of champion deceiver is the meeting he held with some local government officials from Marrickville Council on 28 July this year. The minister was in possession of a report which indicated that the local government officials who were meeting with him had seriously underestimated the degree of noise they would experience as a result of the opening of the third runway. This minister, according to those officials, did not tell them about that report. He kept that report secret. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That report only saw the light of day when it was subpoenaed to be heard in the Federal Court hearings of November of this year. That is the reason that report became public. That is another clear example of the way this minister has deceived the people of Sydney over the noise levels they would experience as a result of the third runway being up and running. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing that earns this minister the title of being incompetent is that he opened the third runway months ahead of the rest of the facilities at Sydney airport being ready. You have to ask yourself: why did the minister open the third runway months before the new air traffic control tower would be open? Why did he open it 12 months in advance of the new radar system being able to be used? That is a very good question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The net result of that is that 91 per cent of all flights going into Sydney airport are currently delayed. Ansett experienced up to 30,000 complaints from travellers in one particular day. The capacity of Sydney airport has been reduced from 64 aircraft movements per hour to 50 craft movements per hour. We have gone out and spent over $200 million building the third runway, we have opened it, because this man decided to do it, months in advance of the rest of the facilities being available for use and the net result is the creation of an enormous mess at Sydney airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, Peter Young, representative of Ansett Airlines, said yesterday that the airport infrastructure in Australia is completely broken at this moment. In the process of breaking it, this minister has destroyed the lives of hundreds of thousands of Sydneysiders over the last few weeks because he has not been prepared to deal properly with the issue of noise levels for Sydneysiders. The reason is that his Prime Minister is the man who made the decision to close the east-west runway  for grubby, political purposes. That is why those people are suffering at this time. That is why the opposition moves this censure motion against the Minister for Transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to ANL, he carried out those actions of sacking the board of ANL, of appointing his old mate Neville Wran to run the ANL board for the next six months and of calling ANL a business that you could not give away. We know that all of that was done for grubby, political purposes&mdash;because of the ALP that was coming up in September. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now know the truth of the situation as to why Sydneysiders are living a complete hell of a life at the present time. It is because of this government's grubby, political deals for their own grubby, political ends to try to win votes and seats in Sydney. We now know the reason. It is all due to this minister's incompetence and his inability to properly carry out his ministerial responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why this man should go. That is why this man was nicknamed years ago by the Prime Minister as Dangerman. That is why, if he is not careful, he will become the albatross around the Keating government's neck, like he was the albatross around the Unsworth government's neck all those years ago. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen some censure motions in the 25 years I have spent in public office&mdash;I have seen plenty of them&mdash;but I have never seen a weaker one than the one we have seen here this afternoon, moved by the member for Hume (Mr Sharp).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A censure motion is supposed to be the most serious thing that can happen in the parliament. A censure motion is a debate in respect of charges that should go to the very integrity of the minister being challenged. What did we see in the contribution from the honourable member? Not a single significant charge, but a lot of mealy-mouthed rubbish and recycled press releases&mdash;of course, he is the king of the press releases&mdash;but nothing to sustain the charge that I should be censured by this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I take the opportunity provided to me for the next 15 minutes to deal with some of the issues that have been discussed here this afternoon. I deal particularly with this question of Australian National Line and the actions of the cabinet, given effect to by me, in respect of its financial circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said to the House, the position of ANL was one causing us grave concern. We acted decisively and properly in order to make sure that taxpayers' interests were protected. We acted to make sure that ANL did not continue to haemorrhage to the average tune of $24 million per year&mdash;year in and year out. Indeed, the whole of the process I have instituted on behalf of the cabinet has been aimed at protecting taxpayers' interests, just as was the decision to sell the 25 per cent share in Australian Stevedores, which has been referred to by the honourable member this afternoon. It was a decision taken in order to eliminate a potential liability, which the trade union movement was trying to force us into, to spend $280 million and nationalise the greatest stevedoring company in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have indicated to the House before the nature of the problems facing ANL, but I recount them. The fact is that the due diligence report this year from Price Waterhouse and Salomon Brothers, in no way cut down by the Auditor-General, indicates that ANL over-estimated its profit forecasts, year in and year out. In fact, in September 1990 the advice of the board of ANL to the government was that its shipping terminals and business would earn it $32 million. They lost ANL $5.3 million. The same month, June 1991, the board was forecasting to the government that everything would be okay and that it was going to make $21.4 million in its shipping and terminal businesses. That was its projected profit for the next year. The result was a dismal loss of $26 million recorded by June of 1992&mdash;a turnaround of $47 million in 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was happening during this process? The board of ANL, chaired by Mr Bolitho, was indicating that everything was going to be all right, that everything was going to come up roses in the garden. In fact, it is worth recounting that Mr Bolitho, in his press release of 16 December 1993, claimed that ANL as a whole would at least break even in 1993-94. The result for 1993-94 will be somewhere between a $10 million and $20 million loss, the same sort of loss that it has sustained year in and year out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was only in February of this year that ANL went on the public record in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> saying that the company could expect solid profits for the next few years. We now know, as a result of the work of Salomon Brothers and Price Waterhouse, the very dismal state of that business. It was only six months after that that the company itself was coming to us saying that it wanted to draw down its promissory note, saying that it did not have sufficient funds to pay its bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that ANL has only survived so long by selling assets. This is the bottom line. Mr Bolitho went on television last night&mdash;the member for Hume has relied on him for some of his comments&mdash;and talked about profitability. My challenge is: what profitability? We have not seen profitability for years. If you take out the selling of a large part of its fleet&mdash;it has already sold most of its fleet&mdash;and you take out the sale of its future income stream, another little trick aimed at keeping the company afloat, then you find that the figures for ANL are even more appalling. These sales are not revealed in those figures of an average $24 million a year loss that I have given, but in the process ANL has flogged off most of the fleet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ANL has gone further than that. It has sold the cash flow in respect of some remaining elements of the fleet. If you take out those extras, you find that ANL has pranged not just for the last four years but for six of the last seven years. When I come along, in concert with the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), and say that we are bringing in outside experts and that a due diligence study will be carried out, and when that due diligence study reveals the true state and nature of ANL and the government acts decisively, you have the hide to criticise us. Even then, as I have revealed in the House today, you could not get your act together. The shadow minister for privatisation is saying one thing and the shadow minister for transport is saying another. One is saying `liquidate' in respect of ANL; the other is saying `prop up'. Where do you get off?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You talk about credibility. You have no credibility on this matter. The government was properly concerned about ANL in terms of the approach of the board of directors. It needs to be remembered that Mr Bolitho was there for 10 years. During that whole 10-year period, the company paid $20.7 million in dividends to the government. I repeat: in the whole of the 10 year-period, the government got $20.7 million. During that time, the government pumped $160.5 million into the company in debt forgiveness or equity injection. During that period, the taxpayer went down the gurgle hole to the tune of $140 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Someone had to do something about that situation. It was not just that money that had been lost. The current debt of ANL sits in the books at $180 million. That $180 million has to be picked up at the end of the day by the taxpayer. The government acted decisively and did something about that, and you have the hide to come into this House and challenge us in this censure motion against me. We have done the right and courageous thing in regard to ANL&mdash;the sort of thing that you would never do and never did during the many years that you had the carriage and control of ANL from 1975 to 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You left ANL in 1983 in the most appalling condition, which was why we had to pump $160.5 million of equity injection into it. You avoided your responsibility for ANL in the most scandalous manner. For you to have the hide to come in here and challenge us when we have done the right thing in respect of this matter really defies credulity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have indicated to the House that, even were we to eliminate that $180 million of debt, the company would still be losing money month after month. Of course ANL needs restructuring, and that is exactly what this government is committed to.

In the papers this morning, ANZDL indicated that it wants to bid for ANL. It said that the issue of its reputation will have no bearing whatsoever on what price it pays. The company will base its price, as will all the bidders, on the basis of the worth of the company. It will have the assistance of a very good due diligence procedure carried out independently by Price Waterhouse and Salomons to assist it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make no bones about the matter: I hope that we can see ANL privatised.

There is Laura Tingle, Mr Dempster, who is formerly from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>, the shadow minister for privatisation and the shadow minister for transport, all of whom are saying that there is something in this charge. The directors of ANL  negotiated a sale&mdash;a very favourable outcome from the government's point of view&mdash;to stop us being reduced to a minority shareholding. They secured $28 million. Because that afternoon they could come up with only 20 per cent by way of a deposit and they were given 90 days to settle&mdash;that is a deferred settlement&mdash;that is characterised as the basis of a censure motion against me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was a standard commercial arrangement entered into by the directors of ANL and Malcolm Turnbull, who was the negotiator on behalf of the government, yet in some way that is supposed to represent the basis of a censure motion. What an absolute wet lettuce. It is characterised here as a loan. No money changed hands; it was a deferred settlement. Yet there is something wrong with it! What a load of nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third damp lettuce concerned the third runway. Opposition members asked why the east-west runway cannot be opened. The attempt to charge the Prime Minister of Australia as the person responsible for airport noise in Sydney is about as sincere as John Fahey's charge that all of this was done to assist Bob Carr, whose electorate is on the east-west corridor. Who is it coming from? In the case of John Fahey, it is coming from a man who less than a year ago called for 24-hour access in and out of Kingsford Smith airport. It is coming from the colleagues of John Fahey sitting opposite here. In the run-up to the last election, we all remember the performances of the member for Fadden (Mr Jull) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) when they said that there should be a removal of the curfew. Yet they expect there to be some credibility in this charge that somehow or other the Prime Minister is responsible for the noise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of people in Sydney are much better off. That does not mean that this government does not take with absolute seriousness the plight of those people who are worse off. It is for that very reason that we are committed to restricting the flight paths. It is for that very reason that we are committed to very substantial penalties against people who fly outside those flight paths. It is for that very reason that we want to bring forward the sound amelioration program so that we can treat the worst affected areas. It is for that very reason that we want the new operational requirements at Kingsford Smith to make sure that the minimum number of people are exposed to noise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet you come in here today and talk about opening up the third runway. What you are doing is arguing for more planes into Kingsford Smith, not for jets on the east-west runway. You know that you cannot do that. You are arguing the position of Hazelton Airlines and the position of Graeme McMahon of Ansett. You think that, if all of the propeller planes take off and land to and from the east, you will be able to put more jets on the north-south axis. You know full well that jets cannot take off on the new parallel runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the view of those opposite, that means that five, 10 or 15 more jets per hour can take off when the conditions would mean take-offs to the north across that corridor of people directly under the flight path to the north. That is what you are really about. You are using this to undermine the micro-economic reasons for the development of Badgerys Creek; a second airport that can meet the demands of Sydney and can provide the hubbing arrangements to adequately cater for all of the flights that are currently being demanded. I have told you today that the increase in flights is between 48 and 50 per cent only in the last nine months. That was the third damp lettuce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one should be deceived by any of this, least of all the poor individuals who are suffering at the moment from noise exposure on the north-south runway.

The one characteristic that brought those people together was not just noise and its clear physical and psychological effect upon them and their families, but the firm belief that they have been misled by this government that for so long has carried out, under the protection of silence, a series of activities which were ultimately going to cause massive losses to the character of their lifestyle, to the value of their homes&mdash;to their very sanity.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fine for the minister to tell us why the east-west runway cannot be reopened. It is fine for him to protect himself on the grounds that the CAA says that there are safety reasons. Of course, safety in aviation is of fundamental importance. But the sad fact of the matter is that there are political considerations in this area. The honourable member for Lowe (Mrs Easson), who is in the chamber here today, knows that she has been sacrificed. She knows that she is the loser of this outcome, and she knows that the government has made a decision that Barton, St George, Sydney and Grayndler are more important than the seat of Lowe. Let me assure her of one thing: we are on her side. The boundaries of this problem do not stop at the Parramatta River. This problem goes well beyond that&mdash;well over Lane Cove, well over Hunters Hill and right to the very edge of Ku-ring-gai National Park. Even the animals in the park are complaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were not told about this. My constituents were not told. People in Chatswood were not told. People up in Wahroonga and Turramurra were not told. I had an engineer do a survey this week in west Pymble, and he picked up 88 decibels of sound. It might be worth members knowing that on the race track those very noisy sports cars are not allowed to go over 100 decibels. So when you are talking about 88 decibels in a valley&mdash;that is where this person did the test&mdash;you can see easily what the effect of noise is on the people who are caught in this environment. Geography has them caught, and the sound reverberates through their homes and through their lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Version 6 of the Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport noise management plan was issued in March 1994. When you go through this document, you find these interesting tables outlining the effect that the noise would have on people. It talks about the aircraft noise effect on people by the year 2010. It almost puts you into that somnolent sense that it is over the hill, far away; that it is not really going to be an issue for the people of today. But it is a problem for the people of today; it is a very real problem on a daily basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The questions asked and the analysis which was carried out was very interesting. Was it going to affect conversation, watching TV or listening to radio or music? Would sleep be disturbed by noise? There is an analysis of the number of people who would be affected by the noise: 26,800 would be seriously affected; 127,700 would be moderately affected; 100,000 people would have their conversation disturbed; and 135,300 would be disturbed whilst watching TV or listening to radio. I love the preciseness of these figures. A mere 59,000 people would have their sleep disturbed. The document claims that the total number of people in that group in the population who would be affected by the airport is 417,600 people. My mathematics may not be marvellous but it seems to me that, on the basis of this survey, every single person has been affected to a significant degree by the noise generated by this airport. That survey was done on the basis of the anticipated problems in the year 2010. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been told by the minister today that, in this year alone, the use of Mascot airport has gone up by over 50 per cent in those peak periods. If the increase is 50 per cent in one year, what is it going to be by the year 2010? The people of Sydney demand answers to these problems. They believe, and rightly so, that this analysis which apparently took place was either wrong or was organised in such a way that people were never told the truth. I, like many other members in this House who have been affected by this problem, have received numerous letters from constituents who make these points. They ask us to be their voice in this House. They ask us to say to the government, `You are ruining our lives. Why did you do this to us and why didn't you give us a fair warning?' Mr K. Lane of Turramurra wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before the runway opened we had only 5&mdash;10 planes going over our house a week. Now it is about 80 a day.</PARA>
<PARA>A person in St Ives wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The chief culprits are the 747s . . . at times, they are only a few hundred metres overhead (despite the airport being some 10kms away from us). . .</PARA>
<PARA>The interesting thing is that this analysis done by the government never at any stage suggested that the problems of the airport were going to go beyond a clearly defined area, the northern boundary of which would be the Parramatta River. Not one of the maps provided by the authority, by the government, by the minister, by his department, shows a single indicator of any noise problems north of the Parramatta River or the Lane Cove River. Yet the fundamental fact of the matter is that those figures of the number of people affected by sound are absolutely flawed. The real figure is probably twice that. I think we have a right to know why that is so. Why were those figures so wrong? Why was that analysis so wrong? Why were people not told? Why was this whole exercise carried through with such a degree of secrecy, in an underhand way?</PARA>

We are going to organise the schools and give them a decent system so they will not get the sound effects.' On behalf of those hundreds of thousands of people, I ask the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) who is at the table and Minister Brereton, who is no longer here for this debate, that fundamental question: why did you not sort this mess out before you ruined the lives of these people?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This story goes back to at least 20 October 1976, when Prime Minister Fraser and Premier Wran announced a series of important studies called the MANS study. The object of that study was to examine jointly the implications of the likely growth of air traffic in the Sydney region and to recommend a suitable strategy for major airport development. It is interesting to note that by 14 December 1979 our dear friend Mr Wran and his cohorts had pulled out of the exercise because they did not want to get too close to the heat; it could be a bit embarrassing politically. Nevertheless, in a report which was presented on 14 December 1979 the Commonwealth members recommended that a decision in principle should be taken to develop Kingsford Smith airport by the construction of a close space parallel runway and associated facilities east of the existing north-south runway and that land be reserved in the Sydney region for a second curfew-free major airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member has just said that that would have been disastrous. Let us think this through more carefully. On 7 October 1982 the then Minister for Aviation, Mr Fife, announced the construction of a new runway at KSA. He stressed that `this new runway is not an alternative to a new airport, but a necessary first step if Sydney is to remain as Australia's main aviation gateway'. He added:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">This is pretty cool. You have the opposition deciding that this is such a serious issue that it will not even put up its second eleven; it has brought out its district cricket team. If ever there was evidence that a district team had been brought out on this one it was the statements we have just heard. I do not know if Wal Fife actually did put out that press release. I would like to believe that Wal Fife did not. I would like to believe that Wal Fife has been misquoted. If he seriously put up an argument, as you just did, that you have a north-south runway and that it will simply operate away from the suburb affected by north-south runways all the time, irrespective of the wind direction, then I suspect that if anybody has been a misleader, a liar or a prevaricator in any way, shape or form in this exercise it has been Wal. I find it impossible to believe that of Wal. I think that Wal was a very decent person. The opposition must be making that up. I am sure that Wal would not ever have said anything as silly as that, given the knowledge that he would have of aviation matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that Wal was not able to do at the time was to identify a second airport site in Sydney. That was a privilege which fell to me when I happened to be minister for aviation and we identified the Badgerys Creek site after years of both sides of politics being completely incapable of arriving at a conclusion as to where Sydney's very necessary second airport ought to be. But I can tell you one other thing about the close space parallel runway: it would have made no difference in any of these noise profiles at all. If you sit down there and think your way through logically these propositions, you can see how absurd that proposition is unless you are going to play God and totally change the wind system of Sydney. The one great problem about that close space parallel runway was that it was so close that, unfortunately, you got into the position where you could not increase the usage of the runway at least to the levels of the cross runway carriage. It was a hopeless position to arrive at; nevertheless the opposition of the day managed to arrive at it. What you had out of the solution that the government ultimately arrived at was a workable one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am absolutely delighted to be defending Laurie Brereton in this debate.

But, in case you want evidence of how meretricious the opposition is in this regard, listen to the hypocrisy of the member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) clothing himself in the position that he puts forward for his constituents, allegedly, when all the evidence of the problems that we now confront was evidence that was there and thoroughly understood by all of you when the government took this decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You talked about a fourfold increase of noise and movement. Where did the estimate of that fourfold increase of traffic movement come from? It was a public document. It was the EIS associated with the original decision taken to build the parallel runway. It was an open public document available to all of you on that side of the House and available to your spokespersons when they made their statements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at some of these great statements. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) puts forward a wonderful little performance. Let us take a look at what he said on 22 March:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Environment Minister Ros Kelly has nine days to go before she has to deliver her response to the EIS recommendation that Mascot's third runway be built.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Federal Leader of the National Party Tim Fischer says `D' day is Wednesday 13 November.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"This is the ultimate litmus test for the government to bite the bullet quickly&mdash;failure to do so will see Sydney's `gate way' role collapse.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is two and a half years since the Federal Cabinet approved the third runway . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal has withstood the most stringent and critical scrutiny and quite simply it `stacks up'."</PARA>
<PARA>This is Timmie boy, the fellow who has been up here asking questions of the transport spokesman in question time when the A team was on, before the B team was put into bat. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ACTU Federal President Martin Ferguson says `one of the reasons the third runway has not gone ahead is because it is a political football'. He is absolutely right.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 22 March 1989, the Prime Minister Bob Hawke and the then Minister for Transport and Communications, Ralph Willis, in a joint statement said, `The Government has decided to develop a third runway at Kingsford-Smith Airport subject to the satisfactory completion of normal EIS processes . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So far the protracted EIS study&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the study that told you how much noise there would be&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has cost over $20 million.</PARA>
<PARA>You can't say it was not thorough. The Leader of the National Party continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The unassailable evidence before Minister Kelly includes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>all this evidence you have been trotting around as new&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*The fact that fewer people would be affected by aircraft noise. (70% fewer than at present).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*The alternative Badgerys Creek airport would only reach threshold commercial viability after 2005.  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*Badgerys Creek would cost $2 billion plus while the third runway would only $273 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*The third runway would sustain an additional 36,000 jobs in tourism in NSW and generate an additional $1 billion in GDP.</PARA>
<PARA>This is what the opposition said when the decision was taken on the third runway. What canting hypocrites, what a gaggle of pathological exhibits when it comes to this question of whether or not we are to blame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But does it get better? Does the opposition think it knows something about this? I have simply quoted one press release in this wad the Minister for Transport gave me. Let me quote another one&mdash;and this is even more classic. The media release is entitled `Near miss at Mascot: there must be no further delay with third runway'. That is the headline. That is from the same source, the National Party leader. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any further delay in deciding on a third runway for Mascot could mean loss of life as well as economic sanity.</PARA>
<PARA>Is this the same bunch that is telling us that we ought to operate an east-west runway&mdash;against the advice of the CAA on safety grounds&mdash;in a full-blown sense across a set of parallel runways? Is this the same outfit that is now arguing that we ought to be doing that sort of thing? If ever you wanted an example of canting hypocrisy, that is one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have a bit of difficulty with a cross-wind runway operation that produces near misses and out you go, straight to the media, and tell us, `We can't have any more of these near misses. You have to get that parallel runway in place.' What do you think you would be saying about the Minister for Transport now if he had rocked in here a month or two ago, when the third runway was available for use, and said, `Gentleman and ladies of the chamber, I think I might just leave this runway, constructed as it has been, capable of being fully operational, as it is. I shall keep operating this generally conceded rather unsafe cross runway operation until I am absolutely certain that I have got in place all the particular developments at Sydney.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do you not think that would now be part of a censure motion against the Minister for Transport?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The world has changed dramatically since the Australian government published its last defence white paper in 1987. We knew then that we were living in a dynamic era, but the nature and the pace of the changes which have since taken place were quite unforeseeable. Of all the changes, the most significant has been the collapse of the Soviet Union. This was a massively important event, which fundamentally changed the global security environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Almost overnight, the east-west stand-off, which dominated international strategic affairs for 50 years, was no more. No part of the globe was unaffected by this radical change&mdash;certainly not Asia and the Pacific. This historic geo-strategic change has been accompanied in the Asia-Pacific region by continued and rapid economic growth. Potentially, this too has enormous long-term consequences for strategic relationships and security in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's 1994 defence white paper, Defending Australia, addresses the long-term consequences of these major changes for our defence policy. Defending Australia looks ahead 15 years to provide broad guidance for defence policy making and for the force structure and capability decisions we will have to make. It provides the framework for developing our defence policy through the next decade. Defending Australia is a substantial and complex document. Today I will simply  highlight some of the underlying thinking and key themes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our starting point is the conviction that Australia must maintain the capability to defend itself against armed attack. Despite all the hopes and aspirations we share for reducing the chances of conflict since the end of the Cold War, military force is still an important element in international affairs, and will remain so. That is a fact of life, regrettably&mdash;but a fact nevertheless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also a fact that, while we will do all we can to avoid the use of force ourselves, ultimately, armed force can only be resisted by armed force. We must, therefore, continue to be sure that we can defeat an armed attack on our territory. We have a continent of our own to defend, and a unique set of national interests. We must be self-reliant, with the capabilities to provide for our defence without relying on the combat forces of other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key judgment in this white paper is that fundamental changes in strategic affairs, both globally and within our region, will make Australia's strategic environment more demanding over the next 15 years. The threat of global war has all but disappeared, but so has the predictable shape which the Cold War imposed on strategic affairs throughout Asia and the Pacific. In its place, a new, more fluid and more complex strategic pattern will emerge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Security in the region will be shaped by continued high levels of economic growth. The sustained expansion in the economies of most countries is bringing enormous social and economic benefits. It is also increasing the capacity of many countries to modernise and develop their armed forces, and to become more confident and self-reliant in their security. The military capabilities of our regional neighbours are improving, especially through the introduction of higher technology systems. We will also see a growing capacity to sustain and operate these systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia looks to the future of this region with confidence, and with a strong awareness of the opportunities which Asia offers for our own future. In looking to our long-term security, we will take a positive approach to the region, and to the international defence policies and relationships which support our defence interests. Nevertheless, prudence requires that we maintain the capabilities to ensure our defence self-reliance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's defence policy, as spelt out in this white paper, recognises our responsibility to help shape our security environment. This requires that we engage closely with our region on strategic issues; that we maintain our alliances with the United States and New Zealand; and that we contribute effectively to multinational security efforts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as Australia's prosperity is strengthened by our economic integration with Asia, so our security will be enhanced by closer strategic engagement. Australia has an active role to play in the evolution of a secure regional environment which reflects our needs and interests, and makes armed attack on this country less likely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way we seek to influence this environment will need to evolve as strategic circumstances change. The task will become more challenging as our security environment becomes more complex and more demanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will strengthen our bilateral defence relationships, and actively pursue multilateral approaches to security in the region. In particular, we will foster an accurate understanding of Australia's strategic interests and security concerns. In turn, we will ensure that we understand the perceptions, concerns and capabilities of our neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, our alliance with the United States will continue to be a key element of our defence policy. We will work with the United States to ensure that the alliance continues to meet the needs of both parties&mdash;both in a strategic sense and in the practical benefits it delivers. We will continue to give strong support to the United Nations and other multinational endeavours which promote global security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An effective United Nations can help to make war less likely throughout the world by mobilising international action against aggression. Our support for the United Nations therefore makes a direct contribution to our security. It is also through the United Nations machinery that the government is able to respond effectively to humanitarian crises, such as those in Rwanda and Somalia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Important as these commitments are, we do not structure the Australian Defence Force for them. The ADF has clearly demonstrated that its force structure and readiness levels are sufficient to undertake United Nations tasks, provided the defence budget is supplemented for major contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will continue to examine each multinational operation on its merits, and evaluate each contribution in terms of our national objectives. Effective arms control measures also contribute directly to Australia's security. Therefore, defence will continue to support the government's policy objectives in relation to global regimes for arms control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also strongly committed to transparency in defence planning in order to build trust and reduce suspicion, especially within our own region. The publication of this white paper is in itself an important trust building measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the government will continue its active pursuit of Australia's international defence interests in these ways, the key message of Defending Australia is that our highest defence priority will continue to be to build, maintain and support forces which ensure we can defeat any armed attack against Australia. We do not believe that any country has an intention to use force against Australia. We have no disputes with other countries which might be expected to give rise to the use of force, and there is also no reason to expect one to develop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, disputes can arise and intentions can change relatively quickly. Because military capabilities take many years to develop, it follows that we plan on the basis of capabilities and not threats. Let me repeat that: we plan on the basis of capabilities, not threats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No country has the capability to seize and hold major territory on our continent. Significantly, we believe that no country plans to develop such forces. To do so would require a very large effort, and we would expect to have substantial warning of any such development. However, the capabilities available to mount lesser levels of attack on Australia will grow over the next 15 years. Such attacks could be very damaging to Australia, and could arise with relatively little warning. The key challenge for defence capability planning will be to adapt to the greater demands posed by increasing military capabilities in such short-warning conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will continue to use the most cost-effective means to ensure our security. Our planning will exploit Australia's geographic advantages, technological capabilities and wider national resources to ensure we can defend this country. This means giving clear priority to the naval and air capabilities needed to deny our approaches to an adversary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must recognise, however, that the development of military technology poses new challenges. Over the longer term, we will need to be more selective about those military capabilities in which we must maintain our technological advantage. We will also use our defence capabilities more efficiently. All elements of the Australian Defence Force will work closely together as an integrated force and make the best possible use of their equipment and facilities. Our ability to draw on wider national resources will grow in importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will seek to integrate a range of civil assets and expertise into our defence effort in order to sustain our capabilities more efficiently. This will provide a wider base for developing and supporting high-technology systems. The effective use of our geographical and technological advantages, backed by the diverse strengths of our national support base, will give Australia a defence posture of greater depth and resilience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From this key objective flow the main defence priorities set out in Defending Australia. I want to highlight three today. Firstly, high priority will be given to the skilled people we need in the ADF. The Australian Defence Force's tradition of excellence is based on the professionalism of its people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our deployments to the Gulf War, Namibia, Cambodia, Somalia, Rwanda and elsewhere have demonstrated this beyond question. We should also acknowledge the great body of unsung work which our forces do every day to ensure they retain the necessary levels of proficiency and preparedness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ADF will remain fundamentally dependent on the quality of its people. It is easy to overlook some of the special demands military life places on our people and their families. We must therefore ensure that they receive adequate recognition. While personnel numbers will not increase over the next 15 years, the demands placed on our people by new technology will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recruiting and retaining high-calibre people in the Defence Force presents long-term challenges. Over time, we will increase community understanding of defence and encourage greater recognition of the career opportunities that military service provides. In addition, a wide ranging defence review of the principles which underpin ADF personnel policies and procedures has begun and will be completed next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reserves too have a long and proud tradition of service in peace and war. The white paper makes clear that reserves now have specific roles in our operational elements. They form a fundamental part of our total force and provide important links between the Defence Force and the wider community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Changes in reserve training are being implemented, and a detailed structural review of the army reserve will be carried out next year. This will ensure that our reserves are better equipped, and that their training standards are more closely aligned to those of regular members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the government will emphasise investment in high-technology capabilities which increase our security. We are moving ahead with plans to procure airborne early warning and control aircraft, and we will replace the Macchi lead-in fighters and our ageing transport aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will also proceed with new command, control, communications and intelligence networks, new helicopters for our Anzac frigates, new minehunters and new vehicles for the land force. Our six new Collins class submarines, due to come on line in the next few years, will be the most capable, conventional submarines in the world. They are sufficient to meet our forecast needs. We will, however, review the need for additional submarines in the context of the first five-year defence budget in 1996-97. Our existing Leopard tank fleet will meet our needs until at least 2010. Therefore, we will not take up the recent offer to purchase newer Leopards because this would not be cost-effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence capability development is not just based on acquiring new equipment. In a number of cases, we have the opportunity to enhance our capabilities by upgrading existing equipment and systems. For instance, we will ensure our FA18 Hornet fighter aircraft remain highly effective well into the next century by upgrading their sensors, electronic countermeasures and weapons. We will also undertake major upgrades of Australia's FFG frigates, M113 tracked armoured vehicles, and P3C maritime patrol aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our land force, the scope of efficiencies programmed by army will free up the personnel and resources necessary to raise a fifth infantry battalion. This battalion will be formed over the next three to four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the government will continue to pursue a more effective partnership between Defence and Australian industry. This is essential to strengthen defence self-reliance over the long term. We look to internationally competitive industries in Australia and New Zealand to supply, maintain and adapt our high-technology defence equipment. We also look to industry to design and manufacture equipment suited to our unique needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To encourage and assist our industries to develop the capabilities Defence needs, we have identified a number of changes to the way Defence works with industry. Defence will rely more on the strengths of the commercial sector. We will identify further opportunities for the commercial support program and help industry to acquire more defence related intellectual property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, we will encourage greater local industrial research and development and, within carefully enforced guidelines, encourage increased international materiel cooperation and defence exports. Our emphasis on a strong partnership with industry will be complemented by the efficient use of Australian defence science and technology to help develop and support our most important defence capabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More broadly, successful national defence requires the closest possible links between Defence and the wider Australian community. This partnership ensures that vital support is available for our defence in peace and in conflict. It also provides major benefits to the Australian community through the ADF's activities in areas such as disaster relief, bushfire fighting, search and rescue, and counter-terrorist support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I want to address the issue of resources. National defence can never be done `on the cheap'. More complex and demanding strategic circumstances will place even greater pressure on our defence budget. We cannot escape that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is often assumed that by reducing uniformed personnel numbers we reduce our defence capabilities. This is not the case. Defence has recently achieved major reforms which have reduced personnel numbers and costs significantly without reducing capabilities. Personnel costs have dropped from 60 per cent of the defence budget 20 years ago to under 40 per cent today. The government will continue to seek defence reforms and efficiencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, we recognise that these savings cannot accommodate all the additional pressures on the defence budget over coming years. Those pressures will arise from the need to meet higher labour costs as ADF skill requirements rise and to sustain the operations needed to keep our capabilities highly effective. At the same time, we must invest in major new equipment and facilities because continual development is essential to maintain our relative level of capability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is determined to sustain defence funding. A long-term commitment is fundamental when capabilities take decades to develop and introduce. We will provide the stability and predictability which is so important to the development and management of long-term projects and activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the next few years defence expenditure at current programmed levels will enable the plans and projects outlined in Defending Australia to proceed. Beyond that, modest real increases will be needed to meet the demands of an increasingly complex defence environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has considered these issues carefully and responsibly, and is committed to sustaining defence spending at approximately two per cent of GDP. The government has also decided that, from 1996-97, it will provide defence with a five-year budget commitment. This is a historic commitment. It is a decision which will provide an assured basis for long-term planning. This will allow more efficient development of defence capabilities, more effective procurement from industry and better personnel planning and management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many areas in Australia contribute to our defence objectives. Defence, in turn, contributes to other national interests. This includes Australia's international security interests, which require very close integration of government policies and approaches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relationship between the Departments of Defence, Prime Minister and Cabinet and Foreign Affairs in these areas is especially strong and contrasts markedly with the approach of some 10 years ago. Our commitment to this integrated approach was reflected in the close consultation which occurred during preparation of this white paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decisions we make on crucial resource and other issues over the next few years will shape Australia's defences well into the next century. The government is determined that,  in the coming decades, our adaptable, versatile and self-reliant defence effort will effectively safeguard our country. I present the following papers:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Defending Australia: Defence White Paper 1994&mdash;Ministerial Statement and Paper, 7 December 1994.</EMPHASIS> </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to respond to the government's 1994 defence white paper. I do so in my capacity as the opposition defence spokesman representative in the lower house. I endorse the excellent contribution to the debate about Australia's defence policy made by my colleague the shadow minister for defence, Senator Jocelyn Newman, in the Senate this week. I also commend to those interested in the debate the remarks of my coalition colleagues in the Senate, particularly those of Senator MacGibbon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to have the opportunity to make a few remarks. I held the defence portfolio on behalf of the coalition for some time, which sharpened my interest in defence policy matters. There is also clearly a link between the portfolio of foreign affairs and defence policy issues. As the coalition's current spokesman on foreign affairs, I believe that it is important to be abreast of the issues and to comment on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to continually monitor and assess developments on major defence issues confronting the country. The end of the Cold War has meant the end of direct and de facto superpower confrontation and the lifting of the pall which the threat of global or large-scale regional war had previously brought to world affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The end of the Cold War has brought with it new but sometimes uneasy balances. It has seen the coincident breakdown of order in the Balkans and in central Asia, just to mention two. There have been some increasing tensions over proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in north Asia, for example, which is in our own region. Also, in our own region, the spectacular economic success of some of Australia's neighbours has underpinned a steady improvement in regional defence capabilities and signals an inevitable end to our claims to continued technological superiority in defence capabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, there have been stresses and fractures in long established alliances and there have been renewed pressures on the will and the resources of multinational fora, such as the United Nations. These and other developments have raised new uncertainties and new challenges for defence policy makers. Australia is not immune from direct developments in our own region or from the flow-on effects from events further afield. I quote with approval paragraph 1.6 of the white paper, which I think puts it quite well:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The next fifteen years will see great change in our strategic environment. With the end of the Cold War, important new uncertainties have emerged about the future strategic situation in Asia. Economic growth will increase the power of nations in our region, and political change may make their policies less predictable. Because of these uncertainties, we acknowledge the possibility that our security environment could deteriorate, perhaps quite seriously in the future. We recognise that at some time in the future armed force could be used against us and that we need to be prepared to meet it.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a useful summary contained in the early pages of this defence white paper. This is not to say&mdash;I do not say&mdash;or suggest that Australia suddenly finds itself in a new and threatening environment. But it does mean that the certainties of the Cold War are over and that Australia will have to work hard to promote and secure its own interests in a more fluid and potentially more volatile region. In that context, the coalition does welcome the government's interest in defence and the release of this paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February, the government released its long overdue <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic review 1993</EMPHASIS>. We also welcomed that but made the point that it was rather tardy in coming. In fact, it had merely followed the coalition's earlier policy initiative released in 1992, particularly as it relates to cooperative regional defence. This white paper has been too long in coming, but it is welcome despite that. However, having read it, I am just not sure whether it was worth the wait after all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is sometimes stated by defence commentators in Australia that, leaving the Democrats and the Greens aside&mdash;you can safely discard them when it comes to sensible debate on these issues&mdash;there is a fair degree of common ground between the major parties on defence issues and that differences centre more on the scope and scale of defence preparedness and on issues of portfolio management than on the broad thrust of defence policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some truth in this argument, but I stress that whilst there is some common ground between the government and the opposition this should not be seen as a guarantee of bipartisanship on defence policy issues. Far from it. There are substantial differences between the government and the coalition. When we read this white paper we find that it highlights our concerns and the differences between ourselves and the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some time now we have held grave concerns about the way capabilities, operational readiness and personnel levels are being whittled down under Labor stewardship. We are concerned about mismanagement and about the size of the defence bureaucracy. We see nothing in this white paper which will sensibly address these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under Labor, our defence capability has been cut. Under the 1991 force structure review we lost two out of our six regular infantry battalions. The white paper proposes that the army can re-raise one of these battalions, but only by stripping manpower from somewhere else in an already depleted Australian Defence Force. It is a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul when you have already impoverished Paul. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During Labor's term in office our personnel numbers have dropped by almost 20 per cent. I recognise that some of that has been due to the introduction of the commercial support program. The opposition supports the CSP. I understand that there have been a lot of difficulties with the introduction and implementation of the CSP, but I think the government can go further with the CSP. I say that because I think people join our defence forces to be active in the principal roles of the defence forces and not to be doing those functions which could be contracted out. The opposition is concerned by the fall off in uniformed personnel, especially in combat elements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sustainability levels have been shattered as the government trades off stockholding to meet underfunded recurrent expenditure bills. The much touted force structure review initiatives, such as the ready reserve scheme and the commercial support program to some extent, have simply failed to deliver the sorts of efficiencies and savings expected of them. The list goes on and on. There have been delays in the Collins project, mismanagement and debates about the Anzac contract and we have had the ill-conceived ready reserve scheme which I think the government, in its heart of hearts, knows was ill-conceived from the word go. Virtually anybody who has looked at the scheme would come to that conclusion. The opposition has also been worried about the flea market approach to defence purchasing and the insidious erosion of conditions of service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the heart of all this is the question of defence funding. In this context, the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) is not keen to promote debate about defence in this country. I went to a seminar recently where the minister was supposed to speak, but apparently he declined the invitation because he did not want to promote defence policy debate in this country which I think is a great shame. The minister is on the public record back in November 1992 talking about his role as Minister for Defence. When asked a question about defence funding, the minister told the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that's how I'm judged (by the Chiefs of Staff)&mdash;can I deliver a politically reasonable base funding . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Yet in the 1994-95 budget allocations, spending on defence will drop to the lowest level as a percentage of government outlays since the last year of the Whitlam government. By the end of the current Labor term it will fall to the lowest per cent of GDP since before the Second World War. The minister says, `Judge me by whether or not I have the political clout to keep the dollars going into defence,' but on his own criteria he fails miserably. This defence white paper is yet another confirmation of that sorry fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The failure of the Minister for Defence to meet his own criteria for success as a minister has been recognised by the Labor Left. The incredible thing about Australian politics is that even the Left admits that cuts in personnel and operating costs have been to the detriment of readiness and morale. It put out a paper entitled `The price of peace in an age of uncertainty' which acknowledges:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further defence cuts would raise concerns about Australia's capacity to fulfil its national goals in the area of defence self reliance, Foreign Affairs and the promotion of peace.</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly the direction in which this defence white paper and the government's policy is taking us. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Two Per Cent. Why would anybody believe  that the two per cent is going to be maintained anyway? In the last white paper the government told us that it would keep defence spending between 2.6 and three per cent, which is what was necessary to keep the show on the road. Of course, that has been eroded. I have no doubt that the government will erode it further.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commonsense tells me that spending on defence is like writing out a cheque for home insurance. Honourable members know that, every year when they write out a cheque for insurance, they would have second thoughts and say, `I will work on the basis that there will not be a fire this year because there has never been a fire'&mdash;I am lucky I have never had a fire burn down any of my homes&mdash;but commonsense tells you to keep paying the premium. I believe that when it comes to Australia's defence forces we have to keep on paying the premium. Year in and year out, sadly, this government is whittling away Australia's defence efforts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At $9.87 billion in 1994-95, defence allocations will fall to 2.1 per cent of GDP. This is $2 1/2 billion dollars lower than if spending were pegged at the 1987 expectations raised by the government of a benchmark figure of three per cent. Clearly, the spending projections in the 1987 white paper have proved to be unrealistic and unsustainable. With the latest white paper imposing a cap of two per cent of GDP, the problem can only be exacerbated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will put it in the most simple terms: when the government brought down its defence paper in 1987 it said, `This is what we think we ought to do to defend Australia. This is the personnel and equipment that is necessary.' To achieve that the government would need to spend between 2.6 and three per cent of GDP. That was the way it was going to proceed. It did proceed and proceeded particularly on the capital equipment side. The opposition has supported the government in its commitments to buy new ships, submarines and other sorts of equipment. But the fact is that after it made the commitments it then started to cut back on defence spending. It was committed to various contracts and the like on the equipment side so, when it was short of a dollar, what did it do? It cut into readiness and personnel resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have great people in the Australian Defence Force and I pay tribute to the people who are prepared to serve our country in the defence forces. They have to put up with a hell of a lot. Within the last 12 months I spent a day out on HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Adelaide</EMPHASIS>. I was most impressed by the work the captain and entire crew do. I have been to the RAAF base Pearce. You could not meet Australians more dedicated to the future of this country than those in either of those two situations and the Defence Force in general. We are very lucky to have those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That imposes an obligation on us to look after those who are prepared to serve their country. Let us look at the pay rates for some of our defence people. We pay some of our defence people so little by way of remuneration, take home pay, that they qualify to go around to Social Security for a welfare payment. That is a disgrace. Unfortunately, that is the reality of defence spending under Labor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said in earlier speeches that it would be tragic for Australia's defence if the white paper simply sets about justifying existing structures and capabilities. It is the old trap of situating the appreciation rather than providing a disciplined analysis upon which defence policy and force structure planning can be solidly founded. Unfortunately, this has proved to be true. This white paper simply recycles the 1987 white paper, the 1991 force structure review and the 1993 strategic review. It offers very little that is new to the debate. It is less a policy review than an apology for the government's failure to fund its last white paper proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude my response, which is a bit limited by nature of the schedule today, with three issues. The first goes to Labor's approach to regional defence cooperation. This government, which prides itself on its understanding of Asia, has not managed to strike the right balance in its proposals for closer regional defence cooperation. The 1994 defence white paper fails to recognise that the development of a sense of strategic community, which is so vital to continued regional stability, rests on a balanced effort to strengthen regional relationships as well as on direct bilateral ties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our defence policy document A Strong Australia, released in 1992, the coalition unambiguously supported the strengthening of defence ties in the region under the aegis of cooperative regional defence. Our policy places particular emphasis on the development of defence cooperative arrangements, particularly where these serve to improve stability through transparency and mutual understanding. We were heartened to see that this concept was picked up by the government in the 1993 Strategic Review and were pleased to see its similar acknowledgment in this latest white paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extension of Labor's strategic horizons beyond South-East Asia to North Asia, to include Japan, the Koreas, China and Taiwan, and the Indian subcontinent is also welcome. But, on Labor's record, we doubt whether it will be able to translate its expressions of good intention into effective action. Labor has too often displayed an inconsistency in its dealings with the region and this has, at times, caused some friction. Our relations with Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand have all been bedevilled by Labor's lack of balance and even-handedness. Sadly, I do not see any relief from this in the latest white paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indonesia, for example, is now touted by the defence minister as our most important relationship. I hope that this does not send confusing signals to our longstanding defence partners in the region&mdash;particularly New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Singapore and Malaysia&mdash;who are partners in formal defence arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indonesia is important, but other regional players deserve appropriate regard. Relative size and proximity should not be the only determinants of the importance of bilateral relations. The coalition acknowledges the significant role which smaller and less proximate nations also play in promoting regional stability. It views the scope of relationships between regional nations to be no less important than the strength of discrete bilateral relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the government is right to focus on the development of bilateral relationships, it must not lose sight of the need to promote regional, and not just bilateral, cooperation. And it should not overlook the fact that our bilateral cooperative programs also offer opportunities for promoting interaction between regional counterparts. In particular, concurrent attendance by officers from regional nations at courses at our military and academic institutions offers far greater scope for effective and cooperative interaction than a purely bilateral course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, we should seek to promote seminars and discussions at the senior policy and strategic levels on a broader than bilateral basis. The bottom line is that we must ensure that our finite defence cooperative resources are put to the most efficient and mutually beneficial use. By mutually beneficial, I mean regional and not just bilateral benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter I raise is a rather specific one, but it is on my mind because I have been reading the papers this morning about the Prime Minister and his interest in foreign affairs matters. It reminds me that the skills you learn as a wheeler and dealer in the New South Wales Right are not always appropriately transferred and applied in the matter of sensitive international relations. I refer particularly to two paragraphs in the defence white paper. The first is paragraph 2.17, which refers to Taiwan. It states in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The relationship between China and Taiwan is likely to evolve in response to political change in both, but in a direction that is not easy to foretell.</PARA>
<PARA>I also quote an interesting statement from paragraph 8.29. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In time, opportunities also may arise for constructive contact with Taiwan on defence and security issues.</PARA>
<PARA>My attention was drawn to this, not just because of the newspaper reports this morning but also because of the fact that in the last two or three months I have been in both China and Taiwan and there are some very interesting issues which Australian policymakers should be addressing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a continuation of the political liberalisation in Taiwan. When I was there, I was able to see for myself the vibrant democracy at work as elections were being held for the mayoral positions in both Taipei and Kaohsiung in the south, and there was also an election for the position of Governor of Taiwan Province. It is interesting that, in the outcome, the DPP was successful in wresting the mayoral position in Taipei from the ruling party. The interest in that is that this is yet another signal of the development of a multi-party political system in Taiwan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taiwan has an interesting history. When I was there, the KMT was enjoying its 100th anniversary. The KMT has had a chequered past&mdash;I think that is a fair comment to make&mdash;but it is very interesting to see in Taiwan the unilateral handing over of political power by a monopolist political party to establish a multi-party, democratic system. It is a matter of great tribute to the leaders of the society in Taiwan that those who have held power have been prepared to share power and to establish a democratic system. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second development there is the economic development, which is also picked up in various reflections in the defence white paper. You have to hand it to Taiwan. The fact is that 35 years ago it was an aid recipient with per capita incomes of $200 or $300. Now it has a per capita income of $7,000, and it is still growing at a very considerable rate. You come back from a place like Taiwan and you say, `It's great to be home.' But the second reaction is: `What a comparison.' Taiwan has foreign reserves of $US90 billion compared with our foreign debt of $160 billion. It has high rates of growth, and it is not talking about jacking up taxes because of the current account constraint&mdash;the same old boom-bust recession problem that we have in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point I make is that I am very pleased that the government has picked up many of the proposals made by the coalition to improve the relationship between Australia and Taiwan. This has occurred within the existing political framework, which is quite appropriate. Those improvements have been made and that has been very positive and beneficial for both sides of the relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lastly, I commend the work of Colin Heseltine and those others who provided me with assistance when I was in Taipei. I conclude by quoting paragraph 2.8 of the defence white paper. In part it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The successful initiation of APEC and the ASEAN Regional Forum shows that the region can agree on broad goals. These developments give grounds for optimism. However, ethnic and national tensions, economic rivalry, disappointed aspirations for prosperity, religious or racial conflict, or other problems could produce an unstable and potentially dangerous strategic situation in Asia and the Pacific over the next fifteen years.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the rhetoric of the government.

<PARA>Through the adoption, ratification and application of international labour standards by member states, the ILO's relevant is continually reinforced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has ratified 54 of the ILO's 175 conventions, including the fundamental standards concerning freedom of association, abolition of forced labour, discrimination of employment, equality of opportunity and tripartite consultation. These standards have played a very significant role in improving employment conditions for all of Australia's working men and women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our landmark Industrial Relations Reform Act has, for the first time, given all Australian workers access to key minimum standards based on ILO conventions. It opens the way for Australian workplaces to become more productive and more internationally competitive. It does so within a secure framework of comprehensive minimum standards underpinned by the award system and complementary entitlements based on relevant international standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ratification of ILO conventions has advanced the rights of workers throughout the world across a very broad spectrum. The fundamental conventions on freedom of association, forced labour and quality of opportunity, have now been ratified by well over 100 countries. Together they constitute a vital safety net of industrial protection. The fact that ratified ILO conventions are binding has also helped in countries where there has been a chance of their slipping backwards and adopting regressive legislation. However ILO conventions are by no means rigid, inflexible or overly prescriptive documents. The ILO assesses the need to revise its conventions on an ongoing basis. This ensures that they remain compatible with the realities of modern labour markets. Through its conferences, meetings and technical cooperation activities, the ILO is constantly exposed to the reality of the changing labour market conditions in each and every one of its 171 member states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This experience is invaluable in assisting those member states in their implementation of conventions, in the development of new standards, and in the revision of existing standards. The full and independent participation of employer and worker organisations in the work of ILO also ensures that standards are kept up to date. More broadly, the ILO is uniquely placed to play a major part in improving social and labour conditions, as it is the only tripartite institution at an international level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is presently evaluating several ILO conventions concerning basic human rights, occupational health and safety, and a range of other issues.

We will pursue this objective in full consultation with the states and territories, with employers and with the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is also consulting with the states and territories concerning the possible ratification of ILO convention 169 on indigenous and tribal peoples.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has sometimes been ill-informed comment about how Australia's sovereignty is affected by our international obligations and about the effect of conventions on states rights.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ratification creates binding international obligations on Australia to recognise and to apply in law and in practice the provisions of the ratified convention. The ILO has a well developed system of monitoring a country's practical application of the provisions of a ratified convention.

Ratification invariably follows extensive consultation with state and territory governments and the peak employer and union bodies through the National Labour Consultative Council. </PARA>

This project commenced in 1990 and has been highly successful, achieving higher levels of workplace safety and health and more cooperative industrial relations. It has been widely acclaimed by all parties and has been independently evaluated by Coopers and Lybrand, which described it as `an excellent example of effective development assistance in the South Pacific'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second project with the ILO commenced in February 1993. It is a tripartite project involving Australian advisory and training services to provide assistance to labour ministries, trade unions and employer organisations in Indonesia, China, Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia. Although only in operation for some 18 months now, it is a program that is already having a substantial and positive effect. Most importantly, it has established an internationally acceptable model by which Australia can play a constructive role in the very sensitive area of labour rights and standards. To build on these efforts, we have established an Asia Desk in the Department of Industrial Relations. It is aimed at strengthening our focus on assisting the development of sound industrial relations throughout the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me conclude by saying that I believe the ILO needs to continue to play a key role in guiding and influencing international social policy development. It is uniquely well placed for this, given the universality of its membership, its tripartite structure, its machinery for development and supervising standards, its principles, its values and its 75 years of operational experience. International organisations are strong and effective only if they are supported by their constituents. In Australia, the political parties and the social partners have firmly supported the ILO's principles and its work throughout its 75-year history. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition joins with the Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) in congratulating the International Labour Organisation, the ILO, on the 75th anniversary of its founding. There is no doubt that the ILO has performed a very valuable service and is a very respected organisation in world social and equity terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The International Labour Organisation was founded in 1919 under the Treaty of Versailles. After World War I, representatives of countries present at the peace conference framed a Constitution and an Enumeration of Principles for the International Labour Organisation. These texts would become Part XIII of the Treaty of Versailles. The organisation was formed to improve labour and social conditions. For example, the preamble states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . universal justice and lasting peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Right from its inception, the ILO has encouraged all nations to join its organisation. According to the preamble:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The failure of any nation to adopt humane conditions of labour is an obstacle in the way of other nations which desire to improve the conditions in their own countries . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The 42 members of the League of Nations, including Australia, were the founding members of the ILO. Germany was admitted to the organisation in 1926 and the United States in 1934. It could well be said that the operations of the ILO&mdash;certainly through the early years&mdash;were dominated by European nations and by the developing culture in Europe of a social partnership between labour and capital. The idea emerged and then became the foundation of bureaucratic institutions&mdash;including the ILO&mdash;in such countries as Austria and Germany, where social compacts led to very heavily bureaucratised industrial relations systems. In such cases legislation is often not needed because all work practices are frequently sorted out before such issues ever even reach government. They are sorted out through total bureaucratic mechanisms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said recently that highly centralised industrial relations systems, such as those throughout much of Europe, are reasonably efficient. It is also said that highly deregulated industrial relations systems, such as the one found in the United States, are relatively efficient. But Australia, caught in this time warp in the middle of deciding whether or not we will be highly regulated and centralised or whether we will be deregulated and open, is caught in a problem with makes us less efficient than either one of the others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we have always supported the ILO and continue to do so, it causes some difficulty. One difficulty we have is the way this Labor government selectively uses ILO conventions through the external affairs power of the constitution to back legislation which otherwise would offend the constitutional powers of the various states. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) in his speech to the House a few moments ago talked about sovereignty. He talked about maintaining the sovereignty of Australia through the links of our international treaties. What the minister forgets is that we are giving away a portion of our sovereignty, we have reduced our sovereignty, by allowing international bureaucratic organisations to an extent to make laws which under other circumstances we might not have made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased to hear the minister say that when he considers Australia signing and ratifying a number of conventions for the government he will consult widely with the states, with employers and with union bodies. I trust that he will live up to that statement, that he will consult well and that he will seek the agreement of the states before he signs such instruments on behalf of all the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two examples come to mind of where this government has used conventions, I believe quite improperly, to override the powers of the states. The first recent example was when the Minister for Industrial Relations used ILO convention 137, signed and ratified in 1974, 20 years ago, a convention that we have had no need to use for some considerable time because it dealt with the issue of containerisation in the ports. The minister attempted to use that convention to allow the waterfront union movement through the finance committee to reintroduce employer levies and pooling of employees to create once again a register which the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority had attempted to do away with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The second instance is the Industrial Relations Reform Act, which came into being on 30 March this year as an amendment to the Industrial Relations Act. The minister spoke of that briefly, talking about using the ILO convention to give every Australian worker minimum rights of protection guaranteed. But he has used the ILO convention to override what are state rights. They are written into the constitution as the rights of the states to make laws with respect to industrial matters except where a dispute occurs crossing the borders of two states, in which case the Commonwealth has jurisdiction. So the minister has improperly, in my view, used ILO conventions to legislate to enable his legislation to override state legislation because there was no other way under the constitution that he could do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One area of concern where we differ with the ILO is the issue of freedom of association. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 20(2) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No one shall be compelled to belong to an associa tion.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe very strongly in freedom of association. People in our country&mdash;hopefully everyone in the world&mdash;should have the right to belong or not to belong to any organisation that they choose: a union, a management organisation, a community organisation, any kind of organisation. One of our basic rights should be freedom of association. Article 22 of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every person has the right to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and join trade unions for the protection of that person's interests.</PARA>
<PARA>But ILO convention No. 87, article 2, says simply:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever, shall have the right to establish and, subject only to the rules of the organisation concerned, to join organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation.</PARA>
<PARA>Convention No. 98, article 1, in part says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree with the sentiments expressed in those articles absolutely. But the ILO does not go on in any of its articles, in any of its conventions, to define the right that a worker or an individual shall also have, an equal right, not to belong to a union of trades&mdash;`shall have the right not to belong'. That is a very important difference in principle which we on this side of the House hold dear and which those on the other side of the House, with a Labor government that is indebted to the trade union movement and to the trade union organisations, will not endorse in any way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister talks about the tripartite nature of the ILO. I wish to bring to the attention of the House that in Australia, as in the majority of industrialised nations in the Western world, the rate of union membership is once again falling. A recent article defined, and the Australian Bureau of Statistics has confirmed, that in August 1993 union membership was down to 37.6 per cent of the work force compared with 39.6 per cent in August 1992. The unionisation rate at that time in the private sector was 27.5 per cent compared with 29.4 per cent in August 1992. The rate of decline in the public sector was higher, with the proportion of public sector employees who were union members down from 67.1 per cent in 1992 to 64.4 per cent last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So all categories of union membership are showing falls. That is because of two factors. One is that unions are finding that they are less and less relevant to the needs of employees in workplaces, who today feel much more inclined to negotiate their industrial issues, their pay structures and their working conditions directly with their employer. So the two of them can work together to achieve a highly productive and high quality outcome for their firm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the AAP this morning, the New South Wales Labor Council Secretary Peter Sams has warned that the union movement is in danger of losing its power to lobby government. The ACTU executive meeting in Melbourne this week was told that union membership affiliated with the ACTU had fallen over the last year by 400,000 to 2.4 million. Mr Sams evidently told guests at a breakfast meeting in Sydney this morning that the correct number was more likely to be closer to two million. That is a fall of 800,000 in a very short period. Mr Sams said it was vital that a new membership drive succeed. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`If we can't do it now in 1995 with an improving economy and good employment growth then we are never going to do it and we will end up as a rump, as an unrepresentative group of people that meet from time to time and create a bit of ruckus', Mr Sams said. `But we won't actually have a major representation or a major representative organisation in which we can lobby government for the things we believe in. I think unless we address that issue and address it wholeheartedly in 1995, then we will be in for a very long period in which our influence will be marginalised.</PARA>
<PARA>The tripartite nature of the ILO, about which the minister spoke so eloquently, is in danger in Australia from the union movement destroying itself because of its lack of relevance to a modern work force dedicated to improving productivity, improving wage rates and improving the lives of those who work for Australia's industry. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed work involves the construction of a four-level, open-sided concrete car park, consisting of a covered ground level of 20,869 square metres, three suspended decks, including the open roof level, totalling 58,665 square metres, and a ground floor open car park of 23,500 square metres. It also includes: associated facilities, such as office facilities for car rental companies and police; accommodation for some high vehicles, including small buses; lifts and stairs; pedestrian bridges; goods loading dock; and landscaping and plantings. The project is planned to be completed in two stages. The first stage is expected to be in operation within eight months of the commencement of construction with the second stage following about 15 months later. I table the attached drawings.

<PARA>This project is being conducted by my department. The Maralinga and Emu sites are located in South Australia in the region north of the Nullarbor Plain. Maralinga is 270 kilometres north-west of Ceduna. Emu is 190 kilometres north-east of Maralinga. Between 1953 and 1963, Great Britain conducted several programs of nuclear warhead development trials at Maralinga and Emu. These included detonations of nine nuclear weapons and hundreds of so-called `minor trials' that dispersed radioactive materials. The former test site areas are contaminated to various levels with plutonium and other artificially produced radioisotopes that present an unacceptable risk to future users of the sites. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1969 Britain undertook a program of clean-up works called Operation Brumby. The 1985 royal commission into British nuclear tests in Australia concluded that Operation Brumby was inadequate, based on wrong assumptions and left the area in a more difficult state for any further clean-up. The royal commission concluded, inter alia, that action should begin immediately to effect a clean-up of Maralinga and Emu to a level where they are suitable for unrestricted habitation by the traditional Aboriginal owners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A technical assessment group, TAG, was formed in February 1986 to address technical matters stemming from the royal commission.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During 1990, the Commonwealth government agreed on a preferred rehabilitation option for the Maralinga test sites as a basis on which to seek a substantial contribution to rehabilitation works from the British government. This clean-up option is the lowest cost option developed by TAG that would enable Aborigines to resume access to the former test site areas. It is intended that upon completion of the project the test site area will be returned to South Australian control for addition to the Maralinga Tjarutja freehold lands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December 1993, the Australian and British governments concluded an agreement under which Britain will pay #20 million in an ex gratia settlement of Australia's claims concerning the British nuclear test program in Australia. This amount will be paid in six annual instalments. The first instalment of #5 million was paid in December 1993. The proposed clean-up will reduce the radiological hazards at the test sites to enable Aboriginal use of and transit through the test site area, reduce and possibly eliminate the need for control and surveillance of the sites and remove potential Commonwealth liabilities arising from site contamination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of the works will be undertaken at Maralinga, including: installation of a construction camp at Maralinga village; upgrading of general site infrastructure; construction of burial trenches; collection of contaminated soil and placement in burial trenches; stabilisation of material in selected debris pits and removal of contents from other debris pits to burial trenches; and general clean-up and surface restoration and revegetation of disturbed areas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise the issue of there being a real world outside Canberra. It is time that members of the Keating cabinet came to realise this, got out of their ivory towers in Canberra and had a look at the rest of Australia. I have been prompted to say this because figures just released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics reveal that a Victorian earns an average of $616.60 per week before tax, while a Canberra resident earns $715.40&mdash;almost $100 more per week in net disposable income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest census data available for Bendigo shows that 49 per cent of the city's earning population receive no more than $230 per week. We can compare that with Canberra residents earning $715.40 and Victorian residents earning an average of $616.60. It is quite obvious that people in the Keating cabinet have not been going out into broader Australia to find out exactly what is happening. </PARA>

What has happened is that high unemployment levels have savaged country areas of Australia. We have had `the recession we had to have'. We have had drought. We have had low commodity prices for rural product. All of these things are reflected in the levels of average income per week. I draw that to the attention of the House.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I then went on to talk about Mrs Cohen and her campaign. The fact is that the suburbs of Raby and St Andrews in my electorate are as close to Badgerys Creek and its flight paths as Regents Park is to Mascot. Further, no urban area in western or south-western Sydney is within seven kilometres of the 20 ANEF contour, below which there should be no noise difficulty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be no problem at Badgerys Creek, despite the scaremongering of Mrs Cohen and the newly-endorsed Liberal candidate for Macarthur, Charlie Lynn, unless a government decides to build homes next to the airport site. Who was it two years ago in a very consistent campaign that wanted to build 100,000 residential lots through the South Creek Valley sector surrounding the Badgerys Creek airport site? It was Mrs Cohen and the Greiner and Fahey governments. They had on the planning map of New South Wales a 100,000-lot release surrounding the airport site. Now, spurred on by the impending New South Wales election, they have discovered noise as an issue, having advocated 100,000 homes around that airport site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The master plan and concept for Badgerys Creek has always involved a successful, competitive and well-designed airport serviced by the transport links to and from the airport site and surrounded, most importantly, by industrial land, commercial land, tourist activities and airport related economic use; that is, to have an airport that is efficient, state-of-the-art with a best practice design surrounded by economic land uses. For that reason, the state government should be supporting the accelerated development of Badgerys Creek. It should be supporting&mdash;not holding up&mdash;the planning of the road and rail access to and from the airport site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Shamefully, in the middle of 1992, Mrs Cohen had the planning minister, Robert Webster, come out to her electorate and abandon all the planning for the rail link between Glenfield and the Badgerys Creek airport site. That decision, shamefully, has set back the planning for Badgerys Creek by two or three years. As a result, anyone who has a legitimate concern about noise in the inner city will not find the necessary relief because of the New South Wales government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, in September 1992, the state government agreed to meet infrastructure costs of $1.3 billion associated with the development of the third runway at Mascot. When asked by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) for its commitment to the essential road and rail access to and from the Badgerys Creek airport site, the Fahey government said that it would not be spending a cent. It exposed its priorities of a third runway, no curfew in east Sydney and expenditure of $1.3 billion. The first instalment has gone down&mdash;$500 million for a Sydney to Mascot rail link. That was its priority for east Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In western and south-western Sydney, when there is the opportunity for tens of thousands of jobs at a well-planned airport in our region, the state government came up with a commitment of absolutely nothing. There was no financial expenditure on those important transport links. The only policy it has had in the last couple of years was to build 100,000 residential lots surrounding the Badgerys Creek airport site. It has the hide to then come out, with an election pending, to try to scare people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party has contributed nothing to the development of that airport other than trying to scare people about noise. Shamefully, the newly endorsed candidate for Macarthur has jumped on the bandwagon as part of a low level, shameful tactic by the federal Liberal Party to scare people, knowing it is an absolutely dishonest and total distortion of the truth. </PARA>

That is federal Labor policy. Did the opposition ever think that it might score a point by standing up and saying that the federal Labor Party actually agrees with tollways?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a fundamental tenet of democracy that all people are regarded as equal. The fundamental principle of one vote one value is reflected in the Commonwealth Electoral Act and our electoral system. That reflects the tenet of people being equal and their votes being equal. Unfortunately, this is not reflected by the parliament, the electoral act or the electoral system in my own state of Western Australia. Members should be aware that no legislation has ever been enacted in Western Australia without the support of the state colleagues of those opposite. The conservatives have always dominated the Legislative Council in Western Australia, so the electoral system in Western Australia is determined by them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the attention of the House to the recent redistribution of the state parliament effected by the Western Australian government <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> of Monday, 28 November. The electoral system required by the conservative controlled Legislative Council of Western Australia has the effect of dividing the state into a metropolitan area and a country area. It is interesting to note that of the 1,034,000 enrolled voters at the time the redistribution was effected, over 760,000 of those were in the metropolitan area and over 270,000 were in the country area. There are 34 Legislative Assembly seats allocated in the metropolitan area, so that is 34 for 760,000&mdash;an average enrolment of 22,370&mdash;and 23 seats in the country area for just over 270,000&mdash;an average enrolment of 11,887. Members can see that the vote weighting is two to one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you look at the electoral statistics released by the Electoral Commission at the time of the redistribution and then look at the current boundaries on the same electoral system determined by the conservative controlled Legislative Council, you find that the greatest number of enrolled voters in the metropolitan area is in the seat of Wanneroo, which is in the electorate held by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing). The current enrolment in that seat is 30,885. The country seat with the lowest number of enrolled voters is Ashburton. That seat has 8,610 voters. So we have nearly a four to one weighting there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the new boundaries, the greatest number of enrolled voters in the metropolitan area are in the seat of Belmont. Those 23,511 voters can be compared with the 10,363 voters in the seat of Pilbara. That is before the quotient variant of 15 per cent comes into play. So we can see what those opposite and their state colleagues stand for when it comes to treating people equally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of Thursday, 1 December, I was very interested to see reference made to the President of the Liberal Party of Western Australia. The article entitled `Honey on a Return Ticket' states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Liberal Party State president David Honey went on a strange journey to one-vote one-value and back yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the heat got to him, but Dr Honey first declared himself in favour of ending vote-weighting in elections to the Legislative Assembly and then did a back-flip after a chat with Premier Richard Court.</PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . soon after, Mr Court appeared in the office of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The West Australian</EMPHASIS> at Parliament House and said Dr Honey would be calling because he had got it wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Honey called within five minutes and said the party supported vote-weighting. He had called back after speaking to Mr Court because he had misstated party policy.</PARA>
<PARA>So that reflects the commitment of the state colleagues of those opposite to vote weighting and electoral system rorting. I must say that I was dismayed to see a few days later in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of Monday, 5 December that same David Honey, who one minute before he spoke to Premier Court was in favour of a review of the Electoral Act to take away vote-weighting, had this to say under an article entitled `Boundary changes draw Liberal fire':</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Liberal Party state president David Honey has attacked the new WA electoral boundaries, saying they are diabolical . . . Dr Honey said the electoral Act needed to be reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Honey said the Government should consider amending the Electoral Act so that the commission could redraw the boundary of the Upper House's Mining and Pastoral Region to take in some of the area covered by the Agricultural Region.</PARA>
<PARA>So they want rorts within rorts in Western Australia. They are not committed to people casting equal votes; they are not committed to the basic notion of equality; and they are quite prepared to see a gross malapportionment occur in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mainstream elements of the Western Australian Liberal Party do not believe that people's votes ought to be equal. In fact, half of them do not believe that some people should be entitled to have a vote. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> in August 1992, after the Liberal Party's state annual conference of that year, headed `Plan to end forced voting' states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Liberal Party's annual state conference yesterday backed a call to end compulsory voting in state and federal elections . . . The president of the Canning division, Mrs Ricky Johnston&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>who has been a candidate for the seat of Canning on a number of occasions&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . said it was not compulsory to actually vote.</PARA>
<PARA>She goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A compulsory system meant "dregs of society" got a say whereas with voluntary voting only those who were interested actually cast a vote.</PARA>
<PARA>So those on the other side of the chamber do not believe that votes ought to be equal. They also believe that people who actually have a vote are the `dregs of society'. No doubt this attitude is adopted largely because their so-called `dregs of society' do not vote for them. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is pretty clear that the Queensland Nationals are hell-bent on smashing the coalition at both the federal and state levels. The first shot in this war, in this new Joh campaign, was fired on 15 November when Don McDonald, the President of the Queensland National Party, issued an ultimatum to the Queensland Liberal Party to agree to a joint Senate ticket in that state or face the repercussions. The repercussions of failure to agree to a joint Senate ticket would be three-cornered contests&mdash;three-cornered contests in seats like Fisher, Longman and Groom. That ultimatum, which was delivered by the Queensland Nationals to the Liberals, has passed. Today we have what I think is the second shot in that campaign. Today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A lot of Liberals have been very appreciative of the stand I've taken.

<PARA>like the Liberals. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If I was in the Liberal party I would be clearly worried about the polls.</PARA>
<PARA>The Liberal Party is clearly very worried by the polls. Thinking about those statements, they may not have come from the member for Kennedy; they could well have come from Joh Bjelke-Petersen, and that is the point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point about these attacks by the member for Kennedy is that they all occurred before. They all occurred in 1987 when the Nationals humiliated their leader at the time, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), and pushed him out of the coalition. When is the member for Kennedy going to do that with the current Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer)? When is the push going to come from inside the National Party caucus to really put the pressure on the Leader of the National Party? It is crunch time for the Leader of the National Party as much as it is crunch time for the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know what the answer would be to these questions if we asked the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) or the member for Groom (Mr Taylor). They would say, `Take them on. We can't take any more of these divisive tactics from the National Party. We don't want a repeat of the Joh for PM campaign of 1987. We will stand up to the Nationals.' Because who will be the candidate for the National Party in the federal seat of Fisher at the next election? It will be none other than the son of Joh Bjelke-Petersen&mdash;John Bjelke-Petersen. The lad is looking for something useful to do. He needs a job, so he is now intending to make his bid on the back of this new campaign from the Queensland Nationals to split the coalition.

Is he out there condemning the National Party? Can we expect him to say something to the press about the Liberal Party and the National Party at another one of those famous doorstops where he does not really talk about anything, does not talk about a leadership challenge? Is he going to come in, stand shoulder to shoulder with the Leader of the Opposition, and repudiate the tactics from the Queensland National Party?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The farmers of Australia got $164 million off the federal government. Very regretfully, I think a lot of the farming organisations which laid on their backs and had their tummies scratched by the federal government were lavish in their praise for the $164 million they received. A couple of weeks later, the arts in Australia got $252 million and the ANL employees effectively got around $250 million, but the $164 million was not given to the farmers; it was given to the banks. Effectively, that money goes as a subsidy on the farmers' interest, and that means that the money goes to the banks and not to the farmers. If the banks were borrowing money at five per cent and lending it out at six per cent, I would say, `Fair enough.' But, at the present moment, the banks are borrowing at five per cent and lending it to the farmers at 10 per cent, and the difference is being made up by the Australian taxpayers. Not only is this unfair but also it is toweringly stupid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only was the $164 million supposed to be good for us&mdash;the farmers in this case&mdash;but straight afterwards we had a 1 3/4 per cent rise in interest rates foisted upon us by the federal government. That led to a $302 million a year extra burden upon the farmers of Australia who owe $17,000 million. At the start of the ALP decade, they owed only some $4,700 million. That tripped off a rise in the Australian dollar which saw farmers lose $540 million per year. So, whilst we got $164 million, we now find ourselves in a situation where we have been hit with a bill from the actions of the federal government of an extra $842 million per year. Thank you; it is a lovely Christmas present from the federal government. It indicates clearly the government's treatment of the farming sector of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA>In June this year the Premier of New South Wales requested the assistance of the Commonwealth government for the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service. This government considers that it would be proper for the Commonwealth to provide such assistance as it can in the fight against police corruption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Allegations of corruption within an Australian police service constitute a serious threat to the integrity of the criminal justice system and the safety of the community, not just in the particular jurisdiction but nationally. All jurisdictions have increased their cooperation in national law enforcement initiatives in response to the national and international threat of organised crime. The corruption of one police agency therefore has the potential to compromise the national law enforcement effort and to jeopardise international law enforcement cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such assistance as can be provided without the need for amendment of legislation is, of course, already being provided. Part of such assistance should be the provision of any evidence the Commonwealth might have of, or in relation to, such corruption. In some cases, the Commonwealth can provide relevant information without legislative change being necessary. There are, however, two important instances where specific legislative authority is necessary before information can be communicated to the royal commission. These are in relation to information obtained under the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 and the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979. In relation to the latter, in some circumstances it may prevent New South Wales law enforcement agencies, as well as the Commonwealth, from providing relevant information to the royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matters being inquired into by the royal commission include allegations of corrupt activity by police. By their very nature, such allegations of corrupt activity may include secret transactions involving cash payments and other financial benefits. The amendments to the Financial Transaction Reports Act allow the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service to be treated as a law enforcement agency under the act. This will allow the director of AUSTRAC, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, to pass financial transaction reports information to the royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same conditions of access to financial transaction reports information and use of such information will apply to the royal commission as currently apply to the Australian Tax Office and to the various law enforcement agencies which currently have access to AUSTRAC's data. Information relevant to matters other than those the specific subject of a warrant under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act is obtained by law enforcement agencies. That act has strict rules about to whom such information may be communicated. As the act presently stands, no intercepting agency&mdash;including the New South Wales Crime Commission and the Independent Commission Against Corruption&mdash;could pass relevant information to the royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments provide for relevant lawfully obtained information to be communicated to the royal commission. The royal commission will then be able to use that information for a purpose permitted by the act. The amendments have no financial impact, and I commend the bill to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service has been established by the Fahey government to inquire into allegations of corrupt activity by police. The Fahey government has had a single-minded determination to inquire into and to root out corruption, where allegations of corruption have been made to it; and the establishment of this royal commission is yet another signal from the government of that determination. It is in marked contrast to the stench which has surrounded previous governments in New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay proper respect to Premier Fahey for the initiatives that he has taken, and also of course to former Premier Greiner, who&mdash;whilst suffering a personal penalty as a result of the establishment of one such organisation in the past to deal with allegations of corruption&mdash;always took a very strong stand on this issue in New South Wales. Since these issues have significance beyond the borders of one state, as the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) has said in his second reading speech, it is important that we recognise the very strong stance taken by the New South Wales government in contrast to some of its predecessors&mdash;in particular, the previous Labor administration, which I note is now offering itself for re-election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales authorities, as I understand it, support this bill; the coalition is unequivocal in its support as well, and we seek the support of all members in the early passage of this legislation. As the minister has said, allegations may include secret transactions involving cash payments or other financial benefits. In this regard there are two Commonwealth statutes which are relevant and which provide a framework for the control of such information and for its usage: in particular, the Financial Transaction Reports Act of 1988 and the Telecommunications (Interception) Act of 1979. To ensure that the royal commission has available to it all relevant information and that the arms of government, both state and federal, are put to the task of supporting the royal commission in its terms of reference, it is proposed by this bill before us to facilitate the provision of certain information to the royal commission. In particular, the bill allows for telephone tap material obtained under warrant to be made available to the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose it is surprising that some criminals have yet to work out that telephone taps are available to police authorities. Be that as it may, they are a useful source of information&mdash;or potentially a useful source of information&mdash;for a royal commission of this sort and this bill does allow for that information to be made available to the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also allows the royal commission to be treated as a law enforcement agency so that financial transaction reports information can be passed to the royal commission. In the view of the coalition these are appropriate amendments to support the work of the royal commission and under those circumstances the coalition is pleased to provide its support in a bipartisan manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have mentioned, the New South Wales government supports the bill. I understand that there has been some comment, apparently from the royal commission itself, as to the way in which this matter ought to be dealt with. In a sense I think that is a technical matter. The policy perspective from my point of view is to ensure that the commission does have the information; whether it obtains the information directly or indirectly through existing federal agencies is a secondary consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the government does have plans to include official corruption as a tappable offence, but it is not doing so now simply because it has a pre-set schedule to make further amendments at a later date. I encourage the government to bear in mind the views of the commission to ensure that there is in no sense whatsoever any hindrance to the work of the commission in fulfilling its terms of reference. With those brief words, I offer the coalition's support to this initiative from the government in support of the policy of the New South Wales government and, in particular, we offer support to this royal commission. </PARA>

<PARA>The main purpose of the Australian Capital Territory Electoral Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 is to amend and repeal those parts of the Commonwealth's Australian Capital Territory self-government legislation which are no longer appropriate now that the ACT Legislative Assembly has enacted its own electoral legislation. The bill provides for transitional arrangements for dealing with disputed qualifications of members of the assembly and casual vacancies in the period up to the next assembly election on 18 February 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These provisions arise from a review of the ACT electoral legislation, which was conducted by the ACT administration and my department after self-government was granted in 1989. That legislation, the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 and the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Act 1988, applied the modified Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 to the territory and provided for the Australian Electoral Commission to conduct legislative assembly elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ACT Legislative Assembly has now passed its own comprehensive electoral legislation, some of which came into effect on 25 August 1994.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of this is to provide parallel mechanisms for running ACT elections&mdash;the Commonwealth legislation and the ACT's local legislation. The Commonwealth's Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 still serves, in effect, as a `constitution' for the territory. Some of its provisions need amendment to permit the transition from the Commonwealth's Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Act 1988 to the Electoral Act 1992 of the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth's Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Act 1988 on the other hand needs to be repealed to make way for the ACT legislation, with the exception of section 16, saving that provision which allows division 2 of part XXII of the modified Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 to apply. This enables the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory to continue to determine issues of disputed qualifications and casual vacancies in the period until 18 February 1995, after which the ACT's local electoral laws will commence to apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Item 1 of the schedule to the bill deals with subsection 48(1) of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988.

Item 1 brings the Commonwealth's self-government legislation into line with the Electoral Act 1992 of the Australian Capital Territory in respect of the circumstances following the calling of an extraordinary general election by providing that an ordinary general election shall not be held within six months of such an extraordinary general election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely not. I presume the absence of an opposition speaker suggests that the opposition is supporting this very mechanical bill, and I hope that is true because it should, of course. The significance of the Australian Capital Territory Electoral Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 is that it completes the transition to self-government in the ACT, and that is a very important step. The bill is a quite straightforward one of just handing the responsibility for electoral matters over to the ACT government now that it has passed its own legislation. This completes a process that has been going on now for six years, and has involved the progressive transfer of responsibility for all matters for which the ACT now has responsibility over to it. It does so on the basis that this was a necessary step for ensuring that the last part of Australia which did not manage its own affairs was able to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This step towards self-government was quite controversial in the ACT. There was uncertainty about what it would mean and there was dispute about what the implications were in terms of distribution of power and financial arrangements. But it seemed clear to many people that in a practising democracy it was not reasonable or responsible for one part of the country not to accept responsibility for its own affairs. In a situation where there is a commitment to participatory democracy, it was important that the ACT&mdash;after all, the seat of the national parliament&mdash;should fit that model as well. That was why many of us pushed hard for self-government and why we are very glad to see it in operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it has not functioned free of controversy, and some would say it has not functioned perfectly, but it has been a learning experience for the people of the ACT and for the members of the Legislative Assembly. The functioning has progressively improved and that suggests a growing political maturity within the territory. That is exactly what one would expect and would hope for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I strongly support this bill, therefore, because it is consistent with one of the most important principles on which our country is based&mdash;that is, participatory representative democracy. This completes the process of transition, and I am glad that the ACT government has now its own electoral act which means that the Commonwealth can withdraw from this area and leave the territory to operate independently and responsibly. I strongly support the bill and I hope, now that the shadow minister is here, that he will do the same. </PARA>

There now exists an ACT Electoral Commission and its functions and powers are determined by the procedures laid down in the relevant 1992 legislation, as amended in 1994.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the commencement of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988, which was Commonwealth legislation, the ACT was administered by the Commonwealth through its respective agencies. Debate about a local legislature for the ACT dates back to the time when the seat of government was established here in the 1920s. In October 1988, a package of bills dealing with self-government was introduced into the House of Representatives. After much negotiation regarding the electoral system for the territory, the legislation was passed with amendments in November 1988. A modified d'Hondt system, which provided for a form of proportional representation not previously used in Australia, was established. The system was criticised by the Australian Electoral Commission at the time as being absurd and bizarre. </PARA>

The Commonwealth handed over some of its powers to the ACT government while others&mdash;such as police and the courts&mdash;were transferred over time and, of course, we still have the Commonwealth Federal Police in operation at present. Some legislative powers were reserved to the Commonwealth and were not available to the ACT Legislative Assembly. For example, the assembly could not vary the electoral system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The transition to self-government has not been&mdash;as mentioned by my predecessor&mdash;without problems. The first ACT election held under a modified d'Hondt system took place on 4 March 1989. It proved to be a fiasco. Some 117 candidates stood for 17 positions, there were 108 different parties and nine independents. Apart from the Liberal and Labor parties, there were parties such the Party! Party! Party! Party, the Sun-Ripened Warm Tomato Party and the Surprise Party!. The ballot paper was the biggest ever seen in Australia and the second largest seen in the democratic world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Getting the ballot paper into the voting booths proved to be something of a gymnastic feat, given that it was a metre wide. Once in the booth, the voter was confronted with 139 boxes, which led to widespread confusion. Consequently, the informal vote mounted to 5.69 per cent, which is remarkably low, considering that at the last state election in New South Wales the figure was nine to 10 per cent. Nevertheless, it demonstrated at that stage a not inconsiderable public view, disparate though it may have been described at the time, of not being in favour of self-government for the ACT. Those various components of a political process came out in support of that proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Counting took some nine weeks and it was more than two months from the time of the election before it was determined who had become a member of the Legislative Assembly. Scrutiny of the ballot papers required eight stages and had to be sorted into 209 categories&mdash;a massive feat. Understandably, many ACT residents were less than impressed with what occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the wake of the election, two inquiries were held into the ACT electoral system. In July 1989, the ACT Legislative Assembly established a select committee on self-government to report on a number of issues, including the electoral process. In November 1989, the Commonwealth parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters presented a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Inquiry into the ACT election and electoral system</EMPHASIS>. Among the recommendations of the ACT Legislative Assembly select committee were that the ACT enact its own electoral act and that a separate electoral office be established in the ACT to administer the legislation, provide policy advice to the ACT government, and conduct public awareness and education campaigns on matters relating to ACT Legislative Assembly matters. In the view of the select committee, full ACT control of its own electoral system was an essential ingredient in a self-government process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991, the Commonwealth government introduced the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Amendment Bill. The minister's second reading speech included a commitment to hand over to the ACT the power to control its own electoral system. In the same year, the government also introduced amendments to the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 and the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. This package of legislation enabled the ACT Legislative Assembly to enact electoral legislation specifically for the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Electoral Act 1992 (ACT) was the first stage in the making of the act of the ACT's own electoral laws. It established an electoral commission for the Territory and an independent procedure for the determination of electoral boundaries. The next stage in the process occurred in 1994 when the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1994 (ACT) and the Electoral (Amendment) (Consequential Provisions) Act 1994 were passed by the assembly. The net effect of this has been the construction of parallel mechanisms for running ACT elections&mdash;that is, the Commonwealth legislation and the ACT legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Capital Territory Electoral Legislation Amendment Bill 1994, which is the bill before us, amends and repeals certain Commonwealth laws which are no longer appropriate as a result of the passage of the ACT act. The bill also contains transitional provisions relating to casual vacancies and disputed qualifications for the period leading up to the next ACT general election on 18 February 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 3 of the legislation repeals the Commonwealth's Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Act 1988, as it is no longer necessary. However, subclause 3(2) is a savings provision which states that division 2 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 continues to apply in relation to certain disputed qualifications and casual vacancies. Consequently, the ACT Supreme Court can continue to hear any questions of disputed qualifications and casual vacancies&mdash;should they arise&mdash;until the next ACT general election, when the ACT's own electoral laws will apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subclause 4(1) also provides that the Australian Capital Territory Electoral Act is not and never has been invalid on the grounds of inconsistency with the Commonwealth's Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Act 1988. There are a number of other changes of that nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the shadow Attorney-General of the Australian Capital Territory, Mr Gary Humphries, has said, it is appropriate that the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly take control of its own electoral system following a decision by the people at referendum in 1992. This referendum involved a choice between single member electorates and the Hare-Clarke voting system with a Robson rotation. Some 67 per cent of Canberrans supported the Hare-Clarke system. There was support for that system from every party, except the ALP, which had previously thought it would have a monopoly over power in the Australian Capital Territory forever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the referendum, a major controversy broke out as Ms Follett, the Chief Minister, attempted, in the view of many people, to undermine the results of the referendum with the Labor Party's proposals. In the event, the ALP was forced to back down. The Australian Capital Territory voting system now reflects the wishes of the vast majority of electors. As we have seen in the past and as we will probably see in the future, the probabilities in the Australian Capital Territory are that the balance of power may well be held by independent members of the chamber. In a sense, this gives the two major parties a reasonably fair prospect of having a share of government over time. This is a considerable improvement over the original proposal which would have given to the Labor Party, and the Labor Party alone, a significant and unfair advantage over other political interests. Consequently, the legislation is supported by the coalition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with great pleasure and a sense of pride that I rise to speak on the report of the delegation to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and the 92nd Inter-Parliamentary Union conference in Copenhagen. I will concentrate on our visit to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, for reasons which will become obvious, and decline to speak at length about the Inter-Parliamentary Union conference in Copenhagen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Going to school in the 1950s, as I did, geography and history were an integral part of the curriculum. Everyone of my age knew where Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were and they knew the historical importance of those countries. Fate is rather strange. In the early 1970s I married into a Lithuanian family from Sydney and I quickly gained a new perspective on my versions of world history, coming as I did from an Anglo-Saxon base with a father who, I proudly claim, was one of the original Anzacs. I gained a new perspective into a version of world history, especially concerning Eastern Europe and the choice that people had between the German and Russian domination of that part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, as a federal parliamentarian, having the chance to visit Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania enabled me and my wife to see places at first hand which were previously only spoken about around the table in Sydney and at my home in Hobart. As I said, I wish to confine my remarks today to our visit to the three countries which are often described as the Baltic states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the vast changes occurring in these countries and the very close links Australians have with them now, and as a result of the parliamentary delegation's visit, I would like to think that we as Australians will come to see these countries as separate entities in their own right rather than being bundled up as the Baltic states. Our delegation's visit could not have been timed more perfectly. The delegation was in these countries just as the Russian troops were finally leaving. Fifty years of Soviet domination and subjugation were finally coming to an end. Our delegation's visit to Estonia, the first of the countries that we visited, coincided with the withdrawal of the remaining Russian troops from that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we arrived in Estonia we were told that there was a change in the itinerary and that we were being asked to attend a special thanksgiving service. Those of us who were there were very privileged to be at this special thanksgiving service of the church of Kaarli, attended by the Estonian Prime Minister, Mart Laar. This service was one of the special events in my life. None of us understood a word of Estonian but this did not make a scrap of difference. From the fervour of the singing one could sense the feeling in the country and the rejoicing that its people had now gained their freedom. After this rather moving service, bells in all the churches throughout the country rang out to proclaim the news that Estonia was now Estonian, not part of the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to be part of this enabled all of us to glimpse a little of what was happening throughout Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. For the next several days we were given an insight into life in Estonia as it was under Soviet control, and now as a free and sovereign state. It was evident as we travelled around that housing as we know it was reserved for the privileged few in Estonian society. The vast majority of the people lived in 12- to 15-storey apartment buildings built in the style we jokingly refer to as `Soviet realism'&mdash;grey brick which over time has taken on a black hue. Maintenance appeared to have never taken place. Public transport, cheap as it was, was badly in need of being updated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Life in the Estonian countryside seemed to have remained in a time warp. There were no fences apparent anywhere. Farm animals were taken out and individually tethered. Farm machinery was rarely seen and vast areas of agricultural land were not being utilised. With the end of collectivisation, the whole farming sector of the economy lacked purpose and direction and the potential for development seemed enormous. Those of us who had some farming connections were amazed at exactly what was not happening in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Relations with Russia dominate the foreign policy aspects of Estonian life, and this was no more evident than when we had the chance to visit the former military base in Klooga. We quickly sensed, as I said previously, that the Estonians are a very proud race of people. When we were shown the military base in Klooga we were told that this was one of over 500 such bases throughout the country and for the first time in 50 years people were able to see parts of their country for the first time. It was rather difficult for us to understand, being able as we are to travel wherever we like and to see whatever we like, that one-twentieth of this country had been locked away for 50 years and that people were now seeing their own forests, roads, highways, lakes and the like for the first time. There were tears in their eyes when they spoke of it and it rather moved us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At Klooga we were able to obtain at first hand an insight into the environmental problems facing each of these three countries. I would like to quote from the delegation report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Klooga base had been left by the Russians less than a week before the delegation's visit. It was a wasteland&mdash;a scene of total devastation. Buildings on the base had been stripped of all fittings and fixtures, including wiring, hand basins, taps and door handles. The external surrounds had been similarly treated and roadside culverts had been removed where possible. Outlying buildings were littered with waste. There was no guarantee that the base was free from landmines. Accordingly, the delegation was required to walk on specific routes only. Abandoned pets were also in evidence, and they are also a feature of many of the 500 such places throughout Estonia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure members that we in the delegation were amazed and bewildered by what we saw at Klooga. As I said, it is one of 500 such places in Estonia. I think there are in excess of 560 in Latvia, and there is probably the same number in Lithuania. This legacy affects these countries. It is a vast problem. Given that these countries are still moving from a command economy to a market economy, there is little realistic prospect of funds being available to clear up these bases. Vast sums will be required before such blots on the landscape can be erased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout all these countries, we were confronted with a problem that some of us had no difficulty in understanding: the problem of the Russians still residing in these countries. The question of citizenship and exactly what constitutes an Estonian, Latvian or Lithuanian was raised frequently in our discussions with members of parliament and ministers from all these countries. After 50 years of Soviet domination, and the realisation that these people have now gained their rightful place on the world stage, one can easily understand why many of the people in these countries wish to make the issue of citizenship as stringent as possible, so as to exclude those Russians who have no desire to be a part of these emerging countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this desire to stand on their own is tempered by the ever-present realisation that Mother Russia is not all that far away. Knowing of some of the weird and wonderful characters&mdash;such as Mr Zhirinovsky&mdash;who are espousing Russian domination of these places again, one can understand why people in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are mindful of asserting citizenship rights. But, as I say, mother Russia is not far away. These countries are inextricably linked to Russia for their economic futures, as they are almost totally reliant on Russia for energy supplies&mdash;whether they be oil or uranium rods for the power stations that proliferate in their countryside&mdash;and for the markets for their exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each of these countries is different in its own right. I guess Estonia&mdash;the first country we visited&mdash;had a pretty enormous impact on all of us. Latvia was completely different. It has a huge problem with the Russian presence, in that, after the withdrawal of Russian troops, only 54 per cent of people living in Latvia are Latvians. The rest is made up of Russians, Byelorussians or members of other races. Currently, Latvians are in the minority in the seven largest cities and towns in the country. It was evident from our time in Riga&mdash;where one heard more Russian spoken than Latvian&mdash;that this is an enormous problem. How can the emerging country, with only 54 per cent of its population Latvians, assert its sovereignty? As I say, many of us could understand why pretty stringent conditions have been put on Latvian, Estonian and Lithuanian citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to briefly turn to our time in Lithuania. I have a Lithuanian wife, who was able to return to the homeland, so it was rather special for us. It was a chance for my wife to practice her fluent Lithuanian, and she enjoyed the role of interpreter when we were able to visit parts of the countryside. It was also rather special to have permission to make a slight detour on our way to Kaunas, to visit Jonova&mdash;the town where her parents were born&mdash;and to have a quick glimpse of the countryside around there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second special event was to share a meal with Professor Landsbergis and his lovely wife. Professor Landsbergis was the architect of Lithuanian independence and he took a bold stand, ahead of the other two Baltic countries, in asserting Lithuanian independence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the privilege of going to the radio station, which is not dissimilar to Black Mountain Tower. To see the 13 crosses around the radio station and the display inside the radio station is to understand that those 13 crosses symbolise the places where 13 proud Lithuanians of all ages died for their country, in an attempt to stop the Soviet army seizing the radio station when Lithuania declared its independence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another moving event was to visit the Hill of Crosses in the Lithuanian countryside. It is rather hard to describe it. There is a small hill covered by hundreds of thousands&mdash;and I mean hundreds of thousands&mdash;of crosses of all sizes and shapes from all around the world with messages on them. The Hill of Crosses is a symbol also of Lithuanian independence. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time of the struggle for independence, the Russians tried in vain to wipe this part of Lithuanian history off the face of the map. But every morning the crosses were back and they finally realised that you cannot quell freedom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another special event occurred when Mr Speaker, in addressing the Lithuanian parliament, was persuaded to begin his speech with two sentences of Lithuanian. It was ironic that the only word that he struggled over was the word `Australia'. I would like to incorporate in my speech his opening words in which he offered greetings and best wishes from Australia: `Laba diena iss Australiose Ma-lornu su yumis susiparzhinti.'</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to a number of the support staff on our delegation&mdash;to Pam McDonald, from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, whose counsel was valued by all of us, particularly during that IPU conference; and to Anne Hazelton, the secretary to the delegation, whose performance is reflected in the quality of this report, which is an outstanding precis of what went on during that bilateral visit and in terms of the IPU conference. I would like to acknowledge also the contribution of the Speaker's executive assistant, Geraldine Skinner. Geraldine was always there, always helpful and a great support. On behalf of all us in the delegation I thank Geraldine for her substantial contribution to our visits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to speak briefly to one or two points from the report, firstly in relation to the Baltic states, and to expand a little on one or two points that the honourable member for Franklin has made. The first point that impressed all of us about the Baltic states was commitment to democracy by the peoples of those three countries. Let nobody misjudge what they are about&mdash;they are totally committed to democracy, to democratic processes, to the processes of parliament. In all three countries we saw, albeit at varying stages of development, parliaments being firmly established and governance being firmly established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The peoples of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania can justifiably be proud of what they have achieved since 1991, when their move into democratic processes really started. As the honourable member for Franklin has said, that was not without a certain degree of bloodshed. We saw evidence, direct and indirect, of that while we were in those three countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to the peoples of those three countries for their commitment. Yes, they have a few major challenges ahead of them. In those three countries the inflation rate was running at about 1,000 per cent in 1991. To bring that back&mdash;as they have all, I think&mdash;to double figures, around 20 to 25 per cent at this point in time, is a major achievement. We, as part of the international community, should be doing everything we can on a bilateral and a multilateral basis to assist them in moving further along the path of democratic progress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I would like to make in relation to the three countries is something that was referred to by the honourable member for Franklin&mdash;the Russian legacy. Let there be no doubt about it, there are still a lot of reservations about the Russians in all three countries, perhaps more prominently in Estonia and Latvia than in Lithuania, the last named having a rather more pragmatic approach to the bilateral relationship with the emerging Russian Federation. But it is posing some problems. As the honourable member said, that is exemplified in the citizenship legislation which continues to bounce around within the domestic political environment of those three countries. I think it is something which will put a few pressures on the democratic processes in all three of those countries, but I have every confidence that they will be able to overcome them and move onwards and upwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Estonia, we were scheduled to visit the former Soviet nuclear naval base west of Tallinn. For reasons known only to those in Estonia, the day before we got there it was decided that we were not allowed to visit. The official reason given was that they were withdrawing the rods from the two nuclear reactors which had formed the basis of a simulated submarine at that nuclear naval base. That disappointed a number of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, having, as a replacement for that, visited the former armoured brigade camp at a place called Klooga, some earlier views that we had been given about the impact of the former Soviet military forces in those countries were reinforced. We were all made speechless by what we saw. I do not pull punches in referring to the environmental vandalism that has resulted from that Soviet occupation. I will say a little bit more about that in a moment. We were all almost speechless once we had seen Klooga. </PARA>

I put those reservations on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record. I implore the Russian Federation to take every step it can to assist the people of Estonia in that nuclear environment by making quite sure that the area is swept clean before the Russians finally depart in about a year's time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the next couple of years the Russians will have an early warning ballistic missile radar station in Latvia at a place called Skrunda. That is causing some political pressures within Latvia. I hope that can be resolved and that finally, in a year or two, that facility will be dismantled and the Russian military will withdraw. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the military situation in Lithuania and the pressures that are being applied and have been applied, the Lithuanians do not have any Russian military personnel on their soil; nevertheless&mdash;through the back door&mdash;they were forced to give transit rights to the Russian Federation, to the military enclave at Kaliningrad. Kaliningrad is the most highly militarised enclave in Europe, as the report has said. Something between 40,000 and 140,000 Russian troops&mdash;depending on who is speaking&mdash;are still there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The transit rights through Lithuania were negotiated as a result of pressures applied on that country by the Russian Federation in terms of most favoured nation trade status. I think that is to be deplored in many ways but nevertheless, being very pragmatic about it, the Lithuanian people have accepted it. My only comment would be that I hope that progressively the traffic from west to east&mdash;in other words from the Baltic into Byelorussia and into the Russian Federation&mdash;will increase rather than decrease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to mention one other matter, something that was mentioned by the honourable member for Franklin. He would agree with me, and indeed our wives who were with us felt the same way, that the most moving experience during the whole of our travels was the visit to the living skills centre in Vilnius. There we met two young ladies, both of Lithuanian origin, who had set up in 1991 a centre for intellectually handicapped people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that all of us had a few tears in our eyes; Senator Woodley, in particular, was very moved as a result of that visit. I pay tribute to those two young ladies, one from Melbourne and one from Adelaide. I made the point on the House floor about this matter a few weeks ago. It was certainly a most moving experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of that visit to the Baltic states, the visit to the Hill of Crosses was also a very moving experience. As you may or may not know, in Estonia and Latvia the dominant religion is the Lutheran religion whilst in Lithuania 93 per cent are of the Roman Catholic faith. Mr Deputy Speaker, in my view the two things that held those three countries together during the Soviet occupation were, firstly, their faith in their own peoples and, secondly, their religious faith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was reflected very much in that Hill of Crosses. As the honourable member for Franklin has said, the Hill of Crosses is about 100 metres in diameter, about 30 metres high and is covered in millions of crosses. The Soviets attempted, over and over again during their occupation, to bulldoze the area, only to find that within days it was restored. That indicates the commitment that those Baltic people had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final point is in relation to the 92nd IPU conference in Copenhagen. For my part it was a very valuable experience and I believe the Australian delegation performed very well.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a great privilege for me to be part of the delegation to southern Africa and, just to make sure that I do not leave them out at the end, I would just like to record some thankyous at the very beginning of my speech. Firstly, I thank my colleagues who were members of the delegation. The honourable member for Griffith (Mr Humphreys) was the leader, and we all benefited from his experience, goodwill and charm along the way. I was certainly very grateful to have him as leader, and it was a privilege for me to be deputy leader.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) and Senators Dee Margetts and John Coulter were the other members of the delegation. I like to think that, with that wide political mix, we worked well together, that we all benefited from the experience and, hopefully, that we contributed to greater goodwill between Australia and the countries that we visited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was grateful to, in particular, the parliaments of the three countries who hosted us: Zimbabwe, Namibia and Botswana. They were very generous in their hospitality, just as we were welcomed most warmly in South Africa, of course. The former three countries certainly paid for our expenses while we were there and took us under their wing. We had very good briefings before we left this country, and I record my appreciation to AIDAB, Austrade and the Parliamentary Library. The Parliamentary Relations Office was also most helpful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before we went, we met with the South African High Commissioner, His Excellency Mr Steyn, with whom we have also met since and with whom we are having an ongoing dialogue. We also met the Zimbabwe High Commissioner, His Excellency Professor Patel. The Australian High Commissioner in Zimbabwe is Kerry Sibraa, who was the former President of the Senate and is known to many of us, and it was good to see him and his wife, Julie, there. They were exceptionally good to us, their staff were very helpful, and we had briefings of a very high standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In South Africa we were fortunate to be met by the High Commissioner, Ross Burns, and his staff were also very helpful with their briefings. Peter Roberts accompanied the delegation as secretary, and we were all grateful for the attention that he gave to the members of the delegation. Alan Fewster, who is from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and has responsibility for the South African desk, also accompanied the delegation and we were grateful for his contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is quite lengthy and detailed and I thought that, rather than referring at length today to what is already printed in it, I might just make mention of a few areas that I thought were of particular importance. The goodwill that has developed between these countries and Australia should never be underestimated. I was particularly pleased to note that, in all our formal meetings, it was quite obvious that Australia was regarded highly. Malcolm Fraser, in particular, came in for some very complimentary mentions along the way. These relationships and friendships should be built on, as we will all benefit from them. Australia is still a most fortunate country and, if we can be of assistance as role models as far as democracy is concerned and of assistance more practically, then we are doing our bit for that part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), in reporting on his delegation, mentioned the feminisation of poverty, something that was also most obvious to members of this delegation. It was amazing to consider the number of women with whom we met who were very favourably impressed that an Australian delegation could have a woman as deputy leader. Although it had not occurred to me when I left Australia that that was important, it was certainly important to them, and perhaps it is something that can be thought about in future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also obvious to me that we live in a very small world, and I was reminded of the ease with which friendships can be developed. When the IPU conference met last year in Canberra I attended the day that was devoted to women. The member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) had asked each of the women members of the Australian parliament to host a table for lunch. I had the great pleasure of sitting opposite Edna Mnangagwa, who is now assistant education minister in Zimbabwe. Edna and I got on famously and I showed her my office; we exchanged addresses but did not really get around to communicating after that. Of course, on that occasion that we had lunch together I did not think for one moment that I would be visiting Harare or would have the opportunity to meet up with Edna again so that we could chat and update each other on what had been happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since I have been back in Australia I have been contacted by a member of the South Australian parliament. Julian Stefani attended a conference recently where he met Margaret Dongo, who is a member of the parliament in Zimbabwe, and Margaret was able to pass on to him good wishes to be conveyed to me, which he certainly did. Again, I was reminded of what a small world it is. Just the other night several of us had dinner with the President of the Senate here as the legal committee from Zimbabwe was entertained. Again, messages were able to be exchanged with people we had met in Harare, and I think that this all contributes to a much better relationship between the two countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the report we mentioned Australian aid, which I think has been a subject which from time to time comes up for debate. There were some comments made some time ago as to what regions of the world our aid should be channelled into. All members of the delegation that visited southern Africa, I think, are of the view that southern Africa, not only for trade but also for aid, should be considered as a region. In the report we have come up with areas that we consider it would be important to give attention to. It is not necessarily demanding of a lot of money, but it is appropriate that our expertise be put into these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have developed significant expertise in some areas in Australia which would be particularly beneficial to this area. Those areas include AIDS education&mdash;and I will come back to that in a few moments&mdash;the training of medical and counselling staff, veterinary science, dry land farming, use of solar energy technology, computerisation of taxation and electoral records, which they do not have there at all, collection of census information, trade union training, vocational and trade training, senior secondary education, business education, remote education, mining technology, national park management and sports coaching. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one that gets first mention and is of particular interest to me is AIDS education. Before I went to this part of the world I had certainly heard of the high incidence of AIDS. But when one gets there one sees that it is not just out in remote areas: it is in the cities; it is in the highly civilised areas. Of course, there are no accurate records in many of these areas, but several of us visited the Princess Marina Hospital in Botswana where we met with the surgical registrar and his colleagues, a physician and also a paediatrician. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They do have some very reliable information there, and the statistics on AIDS sufferers are quite frightening: 10 per cent of the whole population, 25 per cent of the sexually active population and in some communities up to 35 per cent. Very often the first indication of the problem is when a very small baby is admitted. Then it is discovered that the mother, and perhaps one of the other children, is HIV positive. The father does not really want to be tested and thinks that a mosquito could well be responsible. The expertise that we have developed in this area is something that could well represent a major input from us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the same subject we met with Dr Stamps, the health minister in Zimbabwe. He was able to pull condoms out of his pocket to show that he was aware of the problems. Apart from anything else, it is a cultural problem. The disease is affecting the heterosexual community there and this should be a lesson for the rest of the world. There should be a selfish reason for our interest and our desire to help because AIDS does not know about international or state boundaries. Areas in the world such as Australia which are certainly way out in front and which have this under control to a large extent have a vested interest in assisting here, quite apart from any humanitarian reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We visited the Alexandra clinic in South Africa where the same problems arose: pregnant women are found to be HIV positive. This is an area that deserves very thorough examination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to mention a few stories along the way because I think they will give some flavour to the trip. I was certainly moved by the degree of forgiveness and reconciliation which was apparent in every one of those countries which we visited. In Harare, we met with the justice minister, Mr Emerson Munangagwa. He had given us a very good formal briefing in the afternoon. He happened to be sitting next to me at dinner and I asked him where he had studied law. I discovered he had studied law when he was in prison. He was in prison before the age of 18. If he had been 18, he would have hung. He gave me some details about some of the torture he had experienced during his 10 years in gaol: for the first three years, he was in solitary confinement. He told me of his elation at independence and of some of the reforms that he was able to achieve as justice minister. Prisoners are now given soap and clothing. One of the first things he did was to promote his torturers as a sign of his forgiveness. I found this example quite extraordinary and something that I had not come across before, and I found this to be consistent through the other countries that we visited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly President Mandela is spoken of extremely highly in South Africa. The Speaker in Namibia and his wife, Sandra, spoke about their new institutions and their old customs. Four years ago, they were tearing themselves apart but now they work together. The various political parties got together to write the constitution, again with an extraordinary degree of forgiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In South Africa, at the high commissioner's residence, we met with a number of people, including Professor Asmal, Minister of Water Affairs and Forestry. He had had 30 years exile in Ireland. He taught at a university there and had, of course, helped write the interim constitution. He spoke to me about how he was notified on the radio that he would be going home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, extraordinary forgiveness and cooperation was exhibited there. And none more so than Mr Govan Mbeki, Vice-President of the Senate and father of the Deputy President. He and Mr Kobie Coetsee, who is a National Party member and President of the Senate, are good friends. Mr Mbeki was in gaol for 20 years and the person who signed his release from prison was Mr Coetsee when he was correctional services minister in 1988. When they wish to converse now and they do not want others to know what they are talking about, they talk in Latin. These examples of harmony, where people who had previously been enemies are now working together, are good examples for people in other parts of the world who still seem to be tearing themselves apart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had very many formal meetings. In Zimbabwe, we were fortunate to be taken to Victoria Falls and to meet with environment officers for the parks. In Namibia, we were taken to Etosha to see the animals and the wonderful tourist opportunities that are open to this part of the world. I would hope that, in the future, Australia's strong ties with this area are maintained. I am certainly grateful for the experience that I had in travelling to this part of the world and I will always be prepared to raise the causes that we have recorded in this report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I consider myself most fortunate to have been a member of the parliamentary delegation to southern Africa in July 1994. At the outset, let me pay tribute to the leader of the delegation, the member for Griffith (Mr Humphreys), the deputy leader, the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), and, indeed, all delegation members. It was a harmonious delegation; and, having been on a delegation to Africa which was not harmonious, I know how important it is to have harmony amongst delegation members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I doubt that any of us had our ideological views changed by each other, but we were able to present our various views in a straightforward and friendly way. I also believe that we projected a very positive image of the Australian parliament and of Australia. As with such delegations, there was a very full program, although at times exhausting, and each of us, I believe, learnt a lot from the wide range of people we met and the diversity of views expressed to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to pay a particular tribute to the current High Commissioner to Zimbabwe, and, indeed, high commissioner to eight other African nations, Kerry Sibraa. The high commissioner travelled with the delegation through Zimbabwe, Namibia and Botswana. It is fashionable for media to be critical of the appointment of former politicians to diplomatic posts or other jobs but, interestingly, the same criticism is never made when serving defence personnel take on jobs as governors or other such appointments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my 12 years in parliament I have been on the occasional delegation and made the occasional overseas trip. Let me state categorically that I have never been briefed as fully as I was by the high commissioner to Zimbabwe. Not only did he have a feel for the countries but he also had excellent local contacts and, in his own diplomatic way, he very skilfully assisted the delegation. I believe that we benefited immeasurably by his assistance. I also believe that Australia is very well served by having him as our high commissioner to not only Zimbabwe but also the other countries. The many years of experience that he gained as President of the Senate, his involvement with the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, his understanding and&mdash;I might say&mdash;love of Africa makes him an exceptional high commissioner for this part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The visit to Zimbabwe encompassed everything from the majesty of the Victoria Falls to watching nervous and foolhardy people bungee jumping off the Zambezi River bridge. I have been assured that it is one of the most spectacular bungee jumps in the world but it is one, unlike my colleague the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths), that I will never experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also the excitement of the visit to the Harare Cricket Academy where I had the honour of presenting cricket balls to up and coming Curtley Ambroses and a couple of other famous cricketers. We were also told about exciting investment opportunities and there were many meetings with ministers. All of these things made the Zimbabwe part of our tour especially rewarding. Zimbabwe is, I believe, one of the successes of Africa. The country has its problems, but then what country does not. I believe that Zimbabwe will overcome whatever current problems it has and will continue to play a meaningful role in the politics of southern Africa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Namibia was, for many of us, the highlight of the tour in that it was so totally unexpected&mdash;from the modern city of Windhoek to the spectacular sandhill formations. The great hospitality and friendship extended gave each of us a determination to revisit the country. Our visit to Botswana was too brief to make a fully detailed appraisal but, again, we were shown great hospitality and friendship. We were impressed with Botswana's approach to tourism, especially in respect of the Okavango Swamp area. Botswana continues on its steady path of stable and democratic government since independence in 1966. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To visit South Africa so soon after the historic elections was a most rewarding experience. The difficulty for South Africa will be fulfilling the sometimes unrealistically high expectations of the majority of the population. The aspects that struck me most were not only the spirit of forgiveness, which the honourable member for Adelaide has already mentioned&mdash;I think it is a particularly African trait which we most certainly do not have in this country&mdash;but also the desire of people on all sides of the political spectrum to make the current system work. It will be difficult and there will be setbacks but in the end southern Africa and its people will triumph. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When South Africans woke on 30 April this year, if formal apartheid was no longer in existence, the social and economic symbols were still there, and in many respects remain&mdash;as, indeed, does the system within the bureaucracy. We had first-hand experience of this when we were to meet a group at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for a round table discussion chaired by Mr D. Laubschur, Chief Director of the Southern Africa Branch. When we arrived as a delegation and were met at the foreign ministry building in Pretoria we were escorted to the office of the former ambassador to Australia, Mr Tothill, famous for his articles in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. Later that day a concerned officer telephoned our high commissioner to ask where the Australian delegation was. In short, Mr Tothill had ambushed us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among the many interesting things Mr Tothill said was that Australia had missed the boat in regard to a relationship with South Africa because of our attitude to the former white regime. I personally do not accept this, and feel that the strong anti-apartheid stand Australia took, as the member for Adelaide said, on both sides of the political spectrum, and the many formal and informal contacts we have with South Africa, will ensure a meaningful relationship between Australia and the new democratic South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, our diplomatic representatives in South Africa went a little overboard with security. I know it is difficult for them with parliamentary delegations, and I suppose it would cause an incident if something happened to a member of a parliamentary delegation. Security is often a problem, and it is a problem in South Africa, but in many respects we were prisoners, albeit it in airconditioned luxury, in both Cape Town and Johannesburg. We were not allowed out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of particular interest to me were the national archives of each of the countries we visited. I was fortunate to visit them all, and with my colleague the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) I visited the archives in South Africa. I would suggest that for a very small outlay Australia could play a significant role in assisting with the archival activities in each of these countries. For example, in Zimbabwe there is difficulty with obtaining foreign currency to allow archivists to travel overseas for training. Namibia is in need of assistance with personnel, and the same is true with Botswana. We could assist with the training of archivists and the provision of facilities in both countries, although I must say that I was most impressed with the way the archives were maintained in sometimes trying and difficult situations in both Namibia and Botswana. The South African archives are well run, on professional lines, and I am sure our national archives will maintain regular contact with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I thank the parliament for giving me the opportunity to be part of this delegation to Africa, a part of the world in which I have a particular interest. I pay tribute to the long-suffering secretary of the delegation, Peter Roberts, who maintained good humour throughout&mdash;not always an easy thing to do with a parliamentary delegation&mdash;and I thank the members of the delegation for their friendship exhibited during the trip. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will enjoy joining in this particular debate about the delegation to southern Africa. It was with some trepidation that I joined this delegation, but I was lucky enough to do that. We were given a briefing prior to going which suggested that it was going to be a high security risk area to go to, and my colleagues from the other side who were going with me were renowned as `comrades'&mdash;I guess that is the best terminology&mdash;but they turned out to be very good friends as well as comrades.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What surprised me is something that the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) has mentioned. Although the region is still a bit unstable, the security aspect was not highly noticeable in our trip around the place. Certainly among the people that we spoke to, the reconciliation aspect was very good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My general feeling is that the whole southern African region is one of high opportunity for Australia. Certainly in the former front-line states of Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia there are huge opportunities for us in trade and also in other dealings&mdash;in particular in aid, but also in intellectual areas such as information systems and education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What impressed me most in those front-line areas was Namibia. Although Namibia has been independent for four years, what surprised and disappointed me most is that we have not had one trade person contact the chamber of commerce in all that time. I note that the Western Australian government is taking a trade delegation to the southern African region and is including Namibia in its trip, which will be good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that specific areas of information systems present a huge opportunity for computer systems in that particular region. In Botswana I was surprised to see very few computer terminals in the parliament and in government offices. We were told at one stage that the tax system in Botswana is still done manually. It totally surprised me that, in this information technology world, we have tax systems still being done manually. Another area that we can work on in southern Africa is that of education&mdash;not only in providing resources, but also in providing the expertise in planning and curriculum development. They are very short on that expertise, particularly in Namibia and Botswana. We have an opportunity there of exporting our knowledge in curriculum development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of opportunity concerns air links. I believe Qantas has established an extra flight per week to the region, but I believe there are opportunities for us to take people to London via southern Africa. If we were to develop more air links between the two regions, we would be developing tourism as a two-way area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed some matters over there which were of concern. The honourable member for Adelaide mentioned health and, in particular, AIDS. That is a very serious concern in that region and we, as a First World country, should be very concerned about the development of that particular virus in southern Africa and perhaps should be making representations elsewhere so we can address the issue over there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was another area of concern for me in South Africa. We travelled to a township called Alexandria. Alexandria is a place of one square kilometre and there are about 300,000 people living in that square kilometre. They live in an array of different housing, mostly lean-tos or shacks. We went to a community hall which had, I think, 200 people living in it. Being the tallest member of the delegation, I was able to look down to observe the living conditions of people there. They had wardrobes facing each other and cardboard boxes and they had passageways into each little family area. Inside, I saw four or five people sitting or lying round in something the size of a double bed. There were 200 people living in this particular community hall and there were sanitary problems&mdash;toilets and things like that were not very good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a humbling experience to go to Alexandria, but the shining light about this place was that we went to a community centre which had a community hall and also a library. What was disappointing about this particular library was that most of the shelves were empty. People were looking for books to fill the shelves. It must be pleasing to my delegation comrades to know that I have started up an appeal in my own electorate to get some high quality, hardcover books from primary schools and to get them over there. They are not just children's books but technical books and also non-fiction books. </PARA>

The leader of the delegation and the deputy leader spoke and then a couple of other people got up and spoke. It was a particular highlight. Another highlight was the visit we made to Vice-President Nkomo in Zimbabwe. He was a very friendly chap. He gave us a rendition of some of his favourite songs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other highlight, I guess, was visiting the archives in South Africa with the member for Throsby, where we met the gentleman who actually designed the new flag. There were 8,000 entries for the flag design&mdash;unlike Australia, which had 35,000&mdash;and not one of them was picked.

In order to clear it up, we need to have some explanations. Let me give the Committee some examples. Firstly, the child support scheme fact sheet supplied to the committee by the Department of Social Security states that 75 per cent of liabilities registered with the CSA are being collected. I might add that a private collection arrangement under the law needs to be registered. Secondly, in its supplementary submission to the committee which was received on 30 June 1994, the CSA states that the overall collection rate of 73 per cent in July 1993 has improved to 75 per cent in May 1994. First off we have liabilities registered; now we are talking about a collection rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the ministerial statement issued on 5 December states that in 1994-94 the CSA collected an amount equal to 75 per cent of the liabilities raised. In the House, the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) said on 6 December that the CSA collected 75 per cent of net liabilities. In addition, since the scheme has started, the CSA has collected 68 per cent of all debt. It is unclear to me, and I think to the committee, where the collection rate applies. Does it apply to all those cases registered with the CSA? Does it apply to all liabilities? If so, what are they? Does it apply to net liabilities? If so, what are they? What is the overall amount of debt&mdash;is it an overall amount of debt, or is it an annualised debt? I am happy to plead to some confusion. I hope the Committee might understand that with these different terms being applied at different times there is a degree of confusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to place on record some thanks, because when one tables a report one does not get that opportunity. In particular, I want to extend my thanks to Michael Carmody, the head of the Australian Taxation Office, and Moira Scollay. It is my belief that the committee has been privileged to receive very good cooperation from them. I also want to say something about the staff of the CSA. Firstly, they were very generous, because the committee was able to go around to quite a number of agency offices and on each and every occasion we had an opportunity to sit down with staff and to discuss the problems as they saw them. I have no doubt that the Child Support Agency is staffed by very genuine people who are working extremely hard in an area that I am the first to admit is very difficult and very complex. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess I have made the point in the report that I have felt that the staff have been forced in some ways to try to exercise their role with one hand behind their back. I also wish to acknowledge that since the inquiry has started there has been a whole myriad of changes that have either been piloted or commenced in the agency. I have never been backward in wanting to offer my congratulations and support for these changes. I would say that the committee's report has created quite a number of challenges for the staff, and that we have really set the bar very high. If the recommendations of this committee are adopted by the agency and successfully implemented, it will be performing at the highest possible level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last, but not least, I would like to thank both Michael Carmody and Moira Scollay for the opportunity on three different occasions to speak to different people, including all the top people in the agency, to discuss the report and to be challenged by their questions. I would be less than honest if I did not report that I very much appreciated those exercises and that they did cause me to reflect on a number of points. I want to reinforce what I have said, that the agency has sought to cooperate fully with the inquiry and it has made the committee's work a lot easier than it might otherwise have been. As can be seen in my comments about the collection rate, there are still some difficulties either in reporting or language that we need to overcome. I will be looking forward to the explanation of the different terminologies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to sincerely thank the members of my secretariat, who worked particularly hard and diligently throughout the course of the inquiry. It was a very complex inquiry and I do not think their role was made any easier by some of the demands I placed on them, but I would certainly like to acknowledge the depth and the quality of the work that has gone into the report. There is another member of the committee present and it would be unfair if I did not acknowledge the fact that there were nine other members of this committee who signed up for a very difficult task. It is pleasing to report that, whilst no member can stand up and claim to have achieved 100 per cent of what he or she sought out of the report, the report does, with one dissenting report, constitute a consensus amongst the committee&mdash;and not a consensus that is at the lowest common denominator, a consensus that I think reflects the best traditions of parliamentary inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is fair to say that this report will be of great interest to electorate offices of members and senators, so I particularly want to draw the attention of members and senators to appendix 3 of the report, which models the changes to the formula. I want to give a couple of examples of how it could be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, in a case where the number of children with the custodial parent is two and the non-custodial parent has no new or adopted children or is in fact single, the non-custodial parent's income is $20,000 and the CP is a sole supporting pensioner at zero income, what would be the changes that the formula would put in place? It is true that the NCP would pay $430 less but still, on $20,000, have a commitment to pay $2,821. The change to the CP annually would be $216. As to the relative disposable income&mdash;again the NCP earning $20,000, the CP on supporting parent's pension&mdash;the NCP would have a disposable income, after tax, Medicare and child support, of $14,129; the custodial parent's disposable income would be $15,598.70. That does not include the value of fringe benefits, which perhaps should be added in but have not been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take an example where the parents are both earning money. This is not a typical example but let us say that the NCP earns $30,000 and the CP earns $30,000. What then would be the change? The non-custodial parent would be paying $1,733 less and the CP would receive that much less, but the NCP would be paying $4,218 in child support per annum. The NCP would have a disposable income of $19,000.50 and the custodial parent would have $29,660.10 income left. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will take an example where there are two children from a previous relationship and two children that are counted in. Again in this example the non-custodial parent is earning $20,000. Effectively, he has responsibility for four children&mdash;that is, two from his first family and two in the new. The change in the non-custodial parent's disposable income would be $947; the custodial parent would receive that amount less. The NCP would have a disposable income of $23,100 and the custodial parent would have a disposable income of $13,621. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an example where the non-custodial parent is earning $30,000 and the custodial parent is earning $30,000, what would be the changes? It would be $2,020 less child support that the non-custodial parent is responsible for; the same amount less would be received by the custodial parent. The child support being paid by the non-custodial parent would be $1,627. The non-custodial parent with a wife and two children would have a disposable income of $24,124.10 and that of the custodial parent, who has the care of the two children, would be $27,069.10. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is always useful to provide honourable members with examples of the implications of the proposed modelling changes to the formula. Again I caution honourable members not to do what the ministerial statement has done, which is to seize upon one recommendation and extrapolate from that, but to look at the report as a whole. It is most definitely a package of recommendations. I think the dearest wish of all committee members would be that the recommendations are mulled over carefully and over some time, so that the response to them is well thought out and structured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am fond of saying that if there are problems with the recommendations I will be really pleased to hear about them. But, if people&mdash;particularly the public at large&mdash;feel that these recommendations are worthwhile, I really feel that they need to exercise a bit of people power to ensure that the government picks up the recommendations, that we see an early cabinet submission and, indeed, that we see the legislation implemented as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to finish on this note: I am not aware of any committee member who did not think that the child support scheme was a good scheme, particularly in concept. I am not aware that any committee member brought a particular bias to committee deliberations. I am not aware that anyone can say about this report that a committee member, or the committee, favoured non-custodial parents, or favoured custodial parents. What the committee was all about was wanting to strengthen this scheme, to see it become more effective, more efficient and capable of sympathetically dealing with the trauma of separation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we have done a decent bit of work in the child support scheme. Our second reference is into the funding administration of the Family Court. We will be dealing with that as quickly as we can; hopefully, we will complete it by the middle of next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those that are involved in the trauma of separation and break-up&mdash;or in examining their entrails, as the committee was&mdash;I must say that it is a pity that we do not have a positive reference. So much government action, so much government interest and so many government dollars go into the damage end of relationships. No-one in the Committee, I am sure, pretends that we can wave a magic wand and make separations disappear or go away. I certainly do not pretend that I or the committee possess such power. But I do say we have got the proportions all wrong. It is an absolute tragedy that the committee does not have a reference to look at the way in which we may provide positive support to families, or to those people in long-term relationships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Marriages and relationships are dynamic things; they change over time. The demands of each partner change over time. They need to be constantly worked at. There are highs and lows, pressures and crises, and&mdash;I regret to say&mdash;there is not a lot of structure in place to provide some assistance or some counselling. I sincerely believe that the dollars going into saving or attempting to repair relationships are going to yield many dollars worth of value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not every relationship will be saved; not every marriage will be saved. But we are not making any effort about too many of them. That is the tragedy. It is my particular dilemma, in the International Year of the Family, that this committee&mdash;the work of which in the last parliament was well received, and the pioneering work of which on the child support scheme will be acknowledged as a benchmark report&mdash;does not have the opportunity, via a reference, to pick up this important sector and to try to complete its pioneering work in this family law area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee probably would not have all the answers or all the clues. But I am sure that we could come up with some very worthwhile suggestions and recommendations that ordinary people&mdash;ordinary family members, who feel that they have nowhere to turn&mdash;would be able to benefit from. I commend the report, and I look forward to the contribution of my esteemed colleague from Queensland, the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell), who is also a member of the committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak on the report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues because it has been a serious responsibility to participate in such a far-reaching inquiry. I thought it was very positive that as a joint committee with representatives of all parties in the parliament the considerable debate within the committee was very often not along party lines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During very intense discussion on many aspects of the scheme members of the committee became very aware of the complexity of the arrangement. We were not looking at just the child support formula; we had to look at the issue of child support in relation to the Family Law Act and the Department of Social Security arrangements, so that at all times we were aware that this was a very difficult inquiry. We are very much indebted to the secretariat, which provided a huge amount of analysis and work. Departments also responded to our requests, even when that took some little time. The modelling from the Department of Social Security,</PARA>
<PARA>for example, was most useful. The committee's recommendations need to be seen as part of a package of reforms, so I hope that the government will not just pick up on a couple of items in our recommendations, as unfortunately it has in initial media releases. The package of reforms brings in interrelationships between the Family Law Act, property settlements and the availability of existing government support and income support for families. No members of the committee have walked away from the core issue of this very important legislation: that both parents have responsibility to maintain and support their children, irrespective of what happens in their relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Chair of the committee, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), has said, it would be wrong to say that people came in with a particular mandate. It is true that as elected representatives and senators we have many constituents coming to our offices complaining about various aspects of this scheme. It is true that in our public hearings we had many non-custodial parents who were motivated to come along and express their serious concern. We sought to balance those concerns with the concerns of custodial parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At all times we attempted to maintain our responsibilities to the parliament and we were aware that prior to the Child Support Agency and the arrangements that are presently in place taxpayers of this country were effectively the de facto parents of many children whose parents' relationships had broken down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1987 when I was working professionally in a mining town I had a number of high income earners on $60,000 to $80,000 a year who were paying possibly less than $20 a week, the maximum income that a single parent could receive before it affected his or her pension. This was obviously unjust, placed a significant burden on other taxpayers and led to an increasing number of sole parents falling well below the poverty line. There is no doubt that the child support legislation has required parents to assume their responsibilities. Indeed, there has been a major change in social attitudes in terms of acknowledging that responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In most cases, non-custodial parents who appeared before the committee acknowledged and admitted their responsibility. Their concern was in relation to the burden that the current formula placed on them. One of the recommendations that we have made is an attempt in our modification of the formula to provide a slight degree of equity and justice between custodial and non-custodial parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although modelling from the Department of Social Security indicated that non-custodial parents were always better off, it was very hard to relate that to the evidence in submissions, through our hotline, and in public evidence, where non-custodial parents said that they were not able to afford to maintain themselves after they had fulfilled their child support obligations and that they were often forced to live with their parents or be supported by partners or friends. That is not a situation that is conducive to ex-marital harmony&mdash;if we can put it that way&mdash;and to the development of positive parenting relationships following the breakdown of marriage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the issues that I was always concerned about in my professional work was to indicate clearly to parents that, irrespective of what happened to their relationship, the one relationship that was never going to change was that they were parents to their children. They had to meet those responsibilities and develop a continuing, positive relationship with their children following the breakdown of the marriage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the burdens and stresses associated with the amount of child support non-custodial parents have been paying and the relationship with the Child Support Agency have had a negative effect on those adjustments, which I think all members of this House would acknowledge are very difficult. One of the great challenges for the Child Support Agency when it was set up was that its workers were not used to dealing with traumatised individuals in this particular way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened, and what caused a great deal of hostility on the part of non-custodial parents, was that after having dealt with the early trauma of the breakdown, and often making arrangements, transferring funds, agreeing to cover bankcard debts, giving the custodial parent maybe the car or the house, and having a number of costs in terms of early resettlement, they would then receive an unreadable letter from the Child Support Agency which would indicate their liability and often a considerable debt because of the delay in processing the application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Non-custodial parents would then react in a very hostile manner. They would try to contact the agency and either would not be able to get through or, when they did get through, would be told, `This is your problem. We are here to collect money for custodial parents.' The perception that the Child Support Agency was down on non-custodial parents gained wide currency. Certainly, the reforms that we are suggesting in terms of the way the agency handles its business and some of the reforms that have already been put in place by the Australian Taxation Office will assist that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we did feel, as a committee, that there needed to be changes to aspects of the formula. One of the contentious issues&mdash;and it was referred to by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) yesterday in his answer in the House&mdash;is the cap on the high income earners. It was originally recommended by the consultative group that that be set at twice average weekly earnings. One of the reasons it appears to have been changed before the legislation came into effect was the cost to parents of going back to court to seek a review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In evidence to our committee, the Department of Social Security noted, and I quote from page 338 of the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By way of context DSS notes that of Stage 2 cases registered with the CSA at 24 February 1994, there are 472 NCPs with taxable income over $70,000 where the custodian has income in the range of $0-$7,000.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Department of Social Security, in its letter to the committee dated 12 May, designated the number of non-custodial parents as being 472. Although it may appear that in reducing the cap we are actually giving high income earners a free go, it has become a severe disincentive. In fact, it becomes a transfer of assets to the non-custodial ex-partner. In many cases, those high income earners are willing and able to provide income support for their children in the way of school fees, health insurance and so on. Our recommendations for flexibility will allow non-custodial parents to have more say in the way that the transfers are made. Non-custodial parents will be able to direct a proportion of their income support without the consent of the custodial parent and a high degree with the consent of the custodial parent, allowing them more involvement in the way the moneys are spent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee did not agree with the submissions from some non-custodial parents that they should have full control over the way their child support is spent. There is a group of non-custodial parents who want to continue to control and dominate their ex-partners, and we do not want to see child support payments used to control and harass custodial parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important to provide some relief at the high income end so that there is not total disincentive. The committee believes that the disregarded income level and the self-support component should be balanced. To tell non-custodial parents that we will give them the equivalent of the dole after they have worked very hard and before we take into consideration their child support responsibilities would be seen by non-custodial parents as discriminatory. Although the amount has not been raised very much, at 1.2 per cent of the pension it will give some measure of relief. At the same time, we recommend that the disregarded income for custodial parents be reduced from average weekly earnings plus the child care component. Effectively this means that the contribution by custodial parents will not be taken into account until they achieve an income of approximately $34,000 to $37,000. That range covers very few custodial parents. We feel that it is more effective to bring the level down to the pension cut-off point, and then to ease down to 50c in the dollar the amount by which the child support withdrawal is calculated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This may appear to be a disincentive to custodial parents, but there are many opportunities for supporting parents to achieve assistance through the Department of Social Security; the JET scheme is an effective example. At the same time, in intact families the situation is that many mothers are in the work force. We want to encourage single parents and custodial parents into the work force, and we believe that by providing equity there is a degree of justice on both sides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the package needs to be seen as a package of reforms. I suspect we will please very few people out there in the community but we would hope that both the government and the community will look at the package as a reform package that goes a deal of the way to redressing some of the concerns that the community obviously has and put before this committee during its hearings and on the hotline. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few brief remarks in support of the comments that have been made by the Chairman of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), and the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) in her remarks about this report. In many respects this is an amazing report. Here is a report of a joint parliamentary committee to which 6,197 submissions were received. That is a record number of submissions in the history of the Commonwealth of Australia. According to information provided by Telecom when a telephone hotline was set up, at least 150,000 attempts were made to contact the committee by people who had a particular interest in the child support scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report is about an operation of government which has been the subject, in terms of the size of the agency, of more complaints to the Commonwealth Ombudsman than any other agency in the Commonwealth of Australia. Almost every member of this parliament at one stage or another over the last few years has made reference to or raised complaints about, either publicly in the chamber or privately with the minister concerned on behalf of constituents, the way in which the Child Support Agency has operated since its inception. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have a report of a parliamentary committee which has been the subject of considerable public discussion, public debate and public input. On that basis alone, I would have thought that it was a report which the responsible ministers of government would have said, on the basis of anecdotal experience, is something that we ought to take careful consideration of. To that one can add a further dimension, and that is that the joint select committee comprises members of both the Senate and the House of Representatives and embodies a range of opinions, political and otherwise. It does not simply reflect the division in this place between the Labor and the non-Labor side of politics. It reflects an ideological spectrum even within those divisions of Labor and non-Labor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not going to name where people sit because we all have our own impressions or perceptions on the ideological spectrum, but it is a committee which includes Senator Carr, the honourable member for Chifley, the honourable member for Capricornia, the member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) and Senator Neal from the Labor party. It includes Senator Spindler from the Democrats and the member for Tangney (Mr Williams), Senator Brownhill, me and Senator Reid, the deputy chairman of the committee. I would have thought anyone who is a student of Australian politics, even in a most basic way, would realise that that covers just about the entire ideological spectrum which is represented in the houses of parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report runs to some 687 pages. Other than in relation to a couple of matters raised by one senator in a dissenting report, it is a unanimous report of this committee. It represents the entire political spectrum of thought, ideals and aspirations in Australia. I refer to the dissenting report because I want to quote what Senator Neal said to put it in context. She starts off by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I must begin this report by stating quite clearly that, even though there are some issues in the Joint Committee report that I cannot agree with, I believe that the majority of the matters raised and the recommendations set out within that report will be of great benefit to the Child Support Scheme and to those whose lives are affected by the operation of the Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>In her concluding paragraph, Senator Neal says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Notwithstanding my disagreement on these matters&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>three matters which she sets out in her short dissenting report&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I again state my support for the balance of the recommendations of the Joint Committee report.</PARA>
<PARA>So here we have a report from a committee which covers the political spectrum of people from the Senate and the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth parliament which is unanimous in all but three matters which are raised by Senator Neal. Senator Neal states twice in her dissenting report that she has total support for the majority of the recommendations. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having this background of the Child Support Agency which has been complained about vigorously and quite loudly by many constituents and complained about on their behalf by many members of parliament, and having a report which was 18 months in the drafting, one would have expected that this was an amazing situation which would have led to some sort of response from the government. It could have said, for example, `We note the work that has been undertaken by the committee. There are a lot of serious matters that need resolution and further thought and consideration and that will be given in due course.' As members of the committee, we would have hoped that a rider would have been added saying that that would have been done as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we get in response? We get something within 24 hours of the report being released. I have been working on this report with my colleagues for 18 months. I could not have read this report and understood it in 24 hours. We have read and re-read and drafted and redrafted and found fine nuances in particular aspects or in aspects of the complexity of the law. We went over the complications of the matters over and over again and we talked about and discussed and reworded to come up with this report after 18 months of reading submissions and listening to many people around the country; yet we have this amazing situation of a response from two members of the government in relation to this&mdash;and I suspect they are out of kilter, even with most of their colleagues&mdash;within less than 24 hours, about 12 hours. They are basically writing off a whole chunk of the report and saying that this is something which we are simply not going to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this really points to the problem that the people who made submissions to this report are going to have to deal with. It has been pointed out quite clearly by my colleagues on the other side that this is a package of recommendations. There is not one member of the joint select committee who will not say that this was a package of recommendations, because quite clearly it is. They are recommendations which must be seen in the light of being a package and being integrated with each other. We cannot simply pluck one out and say, `I don't like that so I am not going to deal with that but I might deal with something else.' It is like a stack of cards or a house of cards; if one is pulled out, others fall down. As a consequence, on that basis the whole report would be a total waste of time. Given that there is this broad support from the committee which was charged with the responsibility of listening to the concerns of the community about the Child Support Agency, I have to say that this is a totally amazing response&mdash;12 hours later to be writing off parts of this. I invite; I urge; I implore the ministers concerned to go back and have a look at it again rather than give this knee-jerk reaction that we have got at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the speech I made when the chair tabled this report, I criticised the Department of Social Security. I think this is part of the problem. I want to take that criticism a bit further today. What I said was that the evasiveness of the Department of Social Security in much of its evidence to the committee was such that, had that evidence been given in a court of law, a judge would be constrained to direct the jury to consider whether or not that evidence was biased and self-serving. Now I did not say that without some support in the report itself. I want to refer briefly to certain passages of the report where that statement is clearly backed up by what is in the report. Paragraph 2.28, for example, on page 18 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Joint Committee considers that the findings from CSEAG's evaluation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>CSEAG is the evaluation advisory committee&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">of each stage of the Scheme may be open to question on the basis that they were reviewing the implementation of their own recommendations. Furthermore, the research and administrative support for both the Consultative Group and CSEAG was provided by the Department of Social Security who had a significant role in the Scheme's development and who were far from disinterested in the outcome.</PARA>
<PARA>If we turn over to chapter 22, again we find there are a series of paragraphs which deal with this particular issue. I go to chapter 22, paragraph 22.1, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Joint Committee has stated its concern in respect of the impartiality of past evaluations of the Child Support Scheme in previous Chapters of its report. In particular, given that the membership of the main body responsible for the evaluation of the performance of the Scheme, the Child Support Evaluation Advisory Group (CSEAG), was exclusively drawn from membership of the Consultative Group whose report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Child Support, Formula for Australia</EMPHASIS> (1988), was critical in the establishment of formula assessment under Stage 2 of the Scheme, the Joint Committee was immediately concerned over the impartiality of CSEAG's findings. Upon examination of CSEAG's evaluation reports, these concerns unhappily proved to be well founded. The Joint Committee discovered that the only major survey which evaluated the impact of the Scheme virtually overlooked the financial situation of non custodial parents and subsequent families. Furthermore, CSEAG's analysis in respect of key components of the child support formula such as the custodial parent disregarded income level was grossly inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We go on to say that the chapter sets out some views in relation to future evaluations. I wish to read a couple of other paragraphs from chapter 22, because they reinforce what I have said, and what I believe is the problem as it has been illustrated in terms of the response that has been made by the ministers to date. In paragraph 22.5 of the report we say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any future evaluation of the child support Scheme must be seen to be truly independent and outside the influence of the departments with policy responsibility for the Scheme, as well as any other parties who have played a significant role in the establishment of the Scheme or in any past evaluation of it. In this way any future evaluations of the Scheme will be publicly seen to be truly independent thereby ensuring public confidence in the results of these evaluations and the Scheme is generally enhanced.</PARA>
<PARA>And in the following paragraph, 22.6, we say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Joint Committee notes the Department of Social Security (DSS) dominates the policy aspects of the Scheme whilst the Australian Institute of Family Studies (AIFS) has been the major body assisting with the evaluations of the Scheme. Neither DSS or the AIFS could be considered to be at `arms length' to the Scheme and the Joint Committee considers that any future evaluation should be conducted at arms length from both organisations.</PARA>
<PARA>Then we go on to suggest a way in which that could be done. Finally, to reinforce the point, in paragraph 22.13 we say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Joint Committee notes that the modelling of the impact of the Child Support Scheme is monopolised by DSS. As highlighted in Chapter 4, DSS has a direct financial interest in the Scheme and consequently is far from disinterested in the outcomes produced by its modelling of the impact of the Scheme. This potential conflict of interest is exacerbated by the fact that the clients of DSS under the Scheme are sole parent pensioners who represent over 90 per cent of custodial parents under the Scheme. Consequently, the Joint Committee considers that the public confidence in the Scheme can be best served by DSS commissioning an independent party to conduct all future modelling of the impact of the Scheme on the relative disposable incomes of both parents.</PARA>
<PARA>So, Mr Deputy Speaker, the evidence in the report is quite clear, and the recommendations which are endorsed by all members of the joint select committee are quite clear from reading these paragraphs of the report. The problem here is that we have a scheme which was basically devised by, and implemented within, a policy section of the Department of Social Security; that reviews and evaluations of the scheme up until the one by the joint select committee were largely conducted or influenced by that same policy section of the Department of Social Security; and that now we have that same policy section of the Department of Social Security presumably giving the ministers advice about the way in which they should react to this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This comes back to what I think is a fundamental misunderstanding about the problems which arise in relation to the Child Support Agency, because it seems to me that there has been an attempt to set up two groups of parents against each other as if there were a conflict that they were at war with each other about. The two groups of parents are custodial parents and non-custodial parents. Other members of the committee have spoken about the tragedy and the emotional trauma of marriage breakdown and divorce, and what we need to try and do to deal with that. I do not have time to speak about that today, except to endorse those remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a nonsense to suggest that these two groups of parents are somehow in conflict with each other and that the way we enhance the position of one group is by somehow putting aside the rights and position of the other. Overwhelmingly, the complaint of non-custodial parents was that in many circumstances their particular financial arrangements were not being taken into account. We have mountains of evidence about that so it is a nonsense to simply dismiss it out of hand. A group of custodial parents said that it was simply impossible to get payments from some of their former spouses. Those two groups are not in conflict with each other; they are two separate sets of problems. This response, which reeks of saying that there is a conflict, is one which is simply not credible. I urge the ministers to withdraw their remarks and consider the matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;People sometimes question the outcomes of international conferences, especially huge conferences such as the United Nations International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo from 5 September to 13 September this year: are they huge talkfests or do meaningful achievements come from them? I suppose, in all honesty, it is a combination of both. There are endless speeches of varying quality and there is a certain amount of political point scoring or governments pushing their own particular line, but there are also some achievements and some meaningful outcomes&mdash;not always immediate, but meaningful nevertheless.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A world population in excess of five billion, growing by about 90 million each year, has been of increasing concern to many people for some years. What did come out of Cairo&mdash;I think it is true to say this&mdash;is that population growth is now viewed as a matter of global concern. I also feel that many people are now looking at population in a wider context, in that it can no longer be seen as a problem which can be tackled in isolation from social and economic conditions. Population must be seen as part of an overall global, economic and environmental problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also much discussion about abortion and I might say that the Catholic Church played a most unhelpful role. No-one at Cairo, or anywhere, was advocating abortion as a means of family planning. It was being said that where abortion is conducted it must be carried out in a proper medical and hygienic manner. Indeed, for some time it seemed that the Vatican was advocating backstreet abortions. Perhaps the negative stand of the Catholic Church on family planning will not change until there are a few women in the hierarchy of the Catholic Church. Ageing men, wandering around in drag, are hardly competent to pontificate on how women should control their fertility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course one of the issues that caused most concern, indeed fright to many delegates, was the issue of empowering women. Many of the male delegates were prepared to agree to the mainstream views of the conference until it came to the question of the empowerment of women. This was too much for many of them but to me the issue seems quite straightforward: until we empower women and take away barriers such as illiteracy and economic dependency the world will make no progress on the population question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One is aware of cultural differences and it is not acceptable for the West, or Australia, to put value judgments on other parts of the world. This is where I take issue with many of my colleagues, even in this House. There is a tendency for us, as politicians, to pontificate on the national or international scheme to impose our moral judgments on others. There is absolutely nothing to indicate that politicians are in any position to impose their value judgments, or their morality, on any other section of the community and we should resist the temptation to do this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Cairo, there was much discussion concerning respect for religious, ethical and cultural considerations. This, for me, caused a great difficulty because, while respecting religious, ethical and cultural considerations, nevertheless, if we are going to make any progress, these are the very considerations that, in many respects, have to be challenged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many people, it is a cultural matter that women have no rights and are not treated equal to men. For many Roman Catholics and others, the whole question of birth control weighs heavily on their religious considerations. It is important that many of these long held cultural considerations be, at least, challenged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Less than 100 years ago, it was a cultural tradition that women in China had their feet bound. It took many people much effort to challenge this cultural tradition and have it changed. The same could apply to female circumcision. For some, this is a cultural tradition and it is argued that those outside the society in which the practice occurs have no right to challenge that tradition. The same argument is put up, and indeed was put up in Cairo, about the role of women, people saying that outsiders from the particular cultural tradition had no right to challenge it. This to me is a nonsense argument and, until some of these religious, ethical and cultural considerations are challenged, all the talk about population is meaningless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It can be said that abortion is a mistake and that, in an ideal world where there is proper education and information about family planning, it would not be resorted to. This is why I found it staggering that some people, including the Prime Minister of Pakistan, argued against sex education. It must be acknowledged that unsafe abortion and its consequences are a major public health concern which governments must address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Post-Cairo, there is widespread recognition that, to be successful, population programs need to integrate development and family planning objectives and to include strategies for addressing this social and economic disadvantage so often associated with high levels of population growth. I was very pleased to participate in what was known as `Parliamentarian's Day', which was held in the chamber of the National Assembly of Egypt. On this occasion, my friend and colleague the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) made what I thought was one of the best contributions of the day. In his speech, he highlighted the concern to achieve social justice for all humanity. He also stressed the universal basis of social justice. Without going into the complex philosophical argument, it can be summed up simply. All the main religions of the world, all the main moral philosophies and all the major traditions of democratic policies have one underlying premise: all human beings are of equal moral worth. The basic premise of equality is the foundation of the key religions of today's modern world, including Christianity, Islam, Judaism and Buddhism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I was not part of the official delegation to the Cairo conference itself, my participation in Cairo was to do with my membership of the Asian Forum of Parliamentarians on Population and Development. In Cairo, there were meetings, discussions and plans to make politicians more aware of the population issue, including the IPU meeting of politicians called `World Population Day'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that the program of action from Cairo was endorsed. Although some countries have entered reservations, nevertheless, member nations are committed to regularly assess their progress towards implementation of the program of action and to report on a periodic basis. Many of the goals set out within the program are ones to which Australia has already given high priority and the targets are more than met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other areas, Australia meets standards at a national level but needs to continue to address the needs of particular groups, such as indigenous peoples, people in rural and remote areas and people from non-English speaking backgrounds. Australia needs to position itself early in ensuring that it meets, or more than meets, the objectives of the program of action. A detailed examination of the program of action has, therefore, been initiated and further statements on the results of these reviews are expected to be made early next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Population is an issue for each of us. Perhaps because we as a country are not overpopulated, the issue does not generate as much debate in Australia or among Australian politicians as it should. If population in Australia is not a problem&mdash;although some suggest it already is&mdash;it certainly is for many of our near neighbours, for example PNG and countries such as Tuvalu and Kiribati. If reports are correct, global warming and the possible increase in sea level will cause a real problem for those countries. Countries such as the Cook Islands will not remain the paradises they are if the population issue is not dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, population is an issue that affects us all. But it is not a single issue and cannot be viewed in isolation from social, economic and environmental issues. I regard the Cairo conference as important and was pleased to have the opportunity to be in that city of some 14 million persons, along with representatives from some 180 nations, to discuss with people issues as diverse as sustainable development and women's reproductive rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate those associated with the Australian delegation. Let us each ensure that in years to come the Cairo conference is regarded not as a giant talkfest but as a turning point regarding population and sustainable development. </PARA>
