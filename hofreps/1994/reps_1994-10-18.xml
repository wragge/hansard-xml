<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That given</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)the intense public concern regarding the Minister for Industrial Relations and Transport's handling of civil aviation matters, particularly those relating to air safety;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)the Minister's incompetent handling of the industrial relations portfolio as exemplified by his apparently imminent capitulation to the mining unions over the abolition of the Coal Industry Tribunal;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)continuing concerns regarding the Minister's role in the Sydney Harbour Tunnel project which has thrust huge additional burdens on the New South Wales taxpayers; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5)the general aura of incompetence, evasion and a willingness to blame others now surrounding the Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This House requires the attendance of the Minister for Industrial Relations and Transport at question time this afternoon to answer questions relating to his portfolio responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA>If ever a minister was swinging by the narrow thread of prime ministerial loyalty and nothing else, it is the Minister for Transport and Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton). He hangs onto his position today for one very simple reason: he is a court favourite of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). He has a longstanding association with the Prime Minister going back to the days of that infamous preselection ballot for the seat of Blaxland in 1969, when&mdash;not on the basis of my allegations as a member of the Liberal Party, but on the basis of the findings of the then national President of the ALP, the now Deputy Premier of Queensland, Tom Burns&mdash;that ballot was rorted to secure the election of the now Prime Minister of Australia. The person who was more directly involved in that process than anybody else was the Prime Minister's old soul mate Laurie Brereton, who subsequently became the member for Heffron in the New South Wales parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, this minister is under a cloud in relation to every aspect of his portfolio responsibilities. The disarray into which air safety has fallen in Australia is nothing short of a national disgrace. Every day there are new revelations of incompetence, new indications that this minister has lost an administrative control and an administrative grip over his portfolio. If we move into the area of industrial relations, we see that in the last couple of weeks two ministerial colleagues of the Minister for Industrial Relations have said that he wants to be shifted out of the industrial relations portfolio. I do not want the minister shifted out of the industrial relations portfolio. I want him shifted out of all of his portfolios because he has completely failed the test of ministerial accountability and ministerial responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday we had the absolutely pathetic performance of the minister trying to lay the blame onto his bureaucrats. There are many Australians who are now asking: when will this bureaucratic blood-letting stop by the minister putting his own head on the chopping block? The only way that public confidence can be restored in areas of air safety and the conduct of industrial relations will be for the minister to be made accountable for his actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With those things in mind and because of the great public concern about the minister's responsibilities, this morning I wrote to the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) asking that the minister turn up in question time this afternoon. But with the arrogance typical of this government and the contempt for parliament typical of this government, the Leader of the House replied in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I see no requirement for the roster to be altered today in the manner you have proposed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is notwithstanding the fact that, when this ministerial roster was first raised, the now High Commissioner to London, Neal Blewett, came to see me about it as Manager of Opposition Business and said, `Look, John, you ought to understand that if we do introduce a roster and some controversy blows up regarding a minister, you'll be able to require that minister's attendance in the parliament to answer questions.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You know who stymied that&mdash;yours truly; numero uno&mdash;the Prime Minister of Australia. He was the person who stymied that, in the same way as he stymied you, sir, when you wanted to stop the rorting of the rules for rebroadcasting of proceedings in this parliament. Remember when you wanted to introduce a scintilla of democracy into the reporting of what goes on here? Who was the thug that told the minister at the table to come into this parliament to upset your recommendation and to humiliate the Speaker of this parliament? It was none other than the Prime Minister. It was you, sir, who tried to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is in the same sort of genre. If ever anybody ought to be there at the dispatch box answering questions asked of him by the representatives of the people of Australia, it is Laurie Brereton. He is doing nothing other than cowardly skulking behind the convenience of the question time roster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This question time roster is nothing more than a ruse to protect mug ministers. If ever that has been demonstrated it is being demonstrated today. Not only is this minister seen to be incompetent in the management of his portfolio responsibilities in relation to civil aviation and industrial relations but also there remains the total scandal of his having deliberately talked down the value of a national asset, namely the Australian National Line. Not only did he talk down the value of that asset but also there is a grave belief, entertained by many people in the Australian community, that he did so in order to give a decent deal to his mates in the maritime union. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say to the honourable member for Gippsland that many people believe that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But above all, there remains the never to be removed stench of the minister's performance as a member of the New South Wales parliament&mdash;his inglorious contribution to New South Wales politics, starting with the infamous Botany Council affair, which has never been erased from the memory of many people involved in New South Wales politics. It was finally ended by the intervention of the then Attorney-General of New South Wales, the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker), when he did something in relation to those particular proceedings that&mdash;let me put it kindly; let me put it mildly&mdash;is not normally done by the first law officer of a state, let alone the first law officer of the Commonwealth. Many people wondered how it was that Frank Walker got a ministerial guernsey in the Keating government given that he was in the Left and Keating and Brereton were in the Right. Some people might well wonder whether that was the reason&mdash;somebody said a little bit of prerogative pay-off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the harbour tunnel. We were told yesterday by an independent Auditor-General's report in New South Wales&mdash;and how the Labor Party hates Auditor-General's reports; Ros Kelly will tell you all about that&mdash;that a project that Laurie Brereton told the public of New South Wales was going to cost $600 million is going to cost $4,000 million. That project is extraordinarily generous to the joint venturers, Kumagai and Transfield&mdash;unbelievably generous to both of those companies. One wonders how it is that any minister could recommend to a cabinet such an unbelievably generous contract to two joint venturers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The public of New South Wales is paying through the neck not only in toll charges to use the harbour tunnel but also in forgone interest. Yesterday it was indicated that one of the generous gifts of the minister in relation to the Sydney Harbour Tunnel was an undertaking that if certain tax deductions were not allowed by the Commissioner of Taxation the New South Wales public&mdash;the poor, long-suffering New South Wales public&mdash;would have to foot the bill for the extra $20 million to $70 million, courtesy of this wonderfully munificent minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a lot of things that Laurie Brereton has to answer for. We want to know on this side of the House why it is that he is not going to be in the parliament this afternoon. If ministerial accountability means anything, it means that Laurie Brereton ought to be at the dispatch box at 3 o'clock this afternoon to answer all of the questions that we on this side of the House have to ask. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This minister has failed all of his portfolio responsibilities. He has sought to evade and deceive the parliament. He has sought to blame his bureaucrats. He has sought cowardly refuge in blaming others. He is happy to take the money and the white car, but he will not take the responsibility. When a minister demonstrates that kind of unacceptable standard, it is time the minister fronted up and faced his critics. If he is not prepared to do that, he ought no longer to enjoy the confidence of this parliament. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, I will take you back to the day that you were elected to the high office of Speaker of the House of Representatives. On that occasion, I think there was a sigh of relief that Leaping Leo had finally taken a back seat. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He is well known for that title. There was a sigh of relief and a bipartisan acceptance of your elevation to high office. On this side, we expressed our support for your election as Speaker in the hope that parliamentary standards would be raised and that the parliament would be so conducted that we would have the opportunity to do the right thing, as we are obliged to do as members of the opposition; that is, to ask searching questions and to put the government to account.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the record shows, after supporting the reform of our parliamentary institution, we ended up not with reformed and better parliamentary procedures but with a worse set of procedures. They are so much worse that, at a time when the heat is rising around a particular minister, these processes are being used to protect the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had ministers on the other side who have been touted as the up-and-coming stars and the clever and competent ministers of Labor. The last fellow that we had whose reputation was built like that, when it all came to pass, could not even run a sandwich shop. Now we have another one of the so-called geniuses of the Labor Party, another one of those political products of the New South Wales Right. When you start to go through the management of his portfolio, there is hardly a thing that this minister has got right. This minister is Incompetence, spelt with a capital `I'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He even suggests it in his own words. It is an incredible fact that in the paper this morning there was a revelation from the minister that he has been telling people that he himself has doubted his own capacity to run his own department. He is in charge of aviation safety in this country. We have thousands of people flying every day. He is backgrounding journalists that Paul has given him so much work to do that he cannot do his job properly. He ought to go for that reason alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an incredible fact that this minister is not going to be here today and that the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) is going to get up and tell us why he should not be here to answer basic questions. The minister ought to answer that question. He has said that he has got nothing to hide. Why is he not coming in at question time to answer a few basic questions? If he has got nothing to hide or, as he said on radio this morning, `I have got nothing to fear', why does he not front up today to answer a few basic questions about his management of his portfolio?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the terms of reference, why does he not tell us why it is that the government will not extend the terms of reference beyond Seaview? For heaven's sakes, there is more than enough to justify a widening of the terms of reference. Then there is the coal tribunal issue. Why does he not come in and face a few questions today as to why he is going to back off to the trade unionists? On what basis is this minister going to back away from a proposition that he put into the parliament in legislative form only a few days ago?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, in terms of this deal he did when he was a minister in New South Wales, you would think the taxpayers of New South Wales were entitled to know whether or not this minister attempted to dupe the Australian Taxation Office and attempted to avoid the scrutiny of the Loan Council. You would think he had some obligation, would you not, Mr Speaker, to front up today and answer a few basic questions. This is a disgrace&mdash;an absolute disgrace!

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, particularly from the first of the two speakers, we got taken on a tour through the nightmares of a longstanding opposition member from New South Wales&mdash;every conceivable conspiracy that he could dredge up from his past experience, his past view, of dealing with his opponents in the New South Wales branch was danced and paraded before all of us. When he was dealing with the responses of the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) to the situation of ANL, he even got to the point of saying that, somehow or other, his entire approach was a product of a conspiracy between him and the maritime unions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a conspiracy, I must say, which has been completely lost on the maritime unions! According to the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), the maritime unions managed to go through a very substantial piece of industrial unrest so much did they hate this alleged conspiracy in which they had got themselves involved. And we can take the same pinch of salt that he doused that particular conspiracy with and apply it to all the rest of the conspiracies that he alleged have taken place in regard to Mr Brereton's relationships with other people in the New South Wales branch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising: the Liberal Party in New South Wales has nothing else to live on but conspiracies. The Liberal Party contribution in New South Wales to the overall position of the Liberal Party in Australia was eight seats out of 52 at the last election. So much for the capacity of the Liberal Party, at least federally, to have some sort of impact on the public thinking in New South Wales. There is obviously in the mind of the member for Bennelong a truly giant conspiracy which has come to involve not only Mr Brereton but the entire voting population of New South Wales as well to keep him out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition also came in and said that what we have here in a roster system, as we have at question time, is a system to protect incompetent ministers&mdash;that is the sole purpose of a roster. This is a situation which desperately needs explanation in the House of Commons, the mother of all parliaments, because repeated governments in the United Kingdom have been involved in a massive 300-year conspiracy! And not just governments of any particular political party&mdash;but one after another, every conceivable political party, including political parties that have long since disappeared from the ballot paper as far as the British are concerned. What happens in the United Kingdom is that, if you happen to be a cabinet minister, you appear for 15 minutes once a fortnight to be subject to questioning on your department. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, it is an empty vessel problem you are confronting here. If I make any noise in this House, it goes bong, bong, bong off the sides of the empty heads opposite, so you must expect a bit of noise reverberating in this direction. After all, opposition members have a lot of explaining to do. They need to write a paper for the British House of Commons to explain to it that its entire question time system is a product of a desire to conceal the activities of ministers in the pursuit of their parliamentary and ministerial duties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, despite what the honourable member and the seconder of his motion have had to say, Laurie Brereton is actually a very easy minister to defend in this place. He is a minister who gets things going. Just look at the New South Wales government now. It is bogged down on a whole plethora of transport infrastructure proposals absolutely essential to maintaining, sustaining and advancing a decent transportation system, particularly in the Sydney metropolitan area. It cannot arrive at a conclusion. It is always the way with the Liberal Party. It is complaining that Laurie Brereton has put a delay on the coal tribunal. Who was in government for about 40 years in this place when the coal tribunal was up there singing, dancing, carrying on, waving flags and doing what it liked? Who was in government? Your good little selves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, yet again, as it was with the tunnel and Darling Harbour and as it is with trying to deal with the problems associated with a separate jurisdiction within the arbitration commission not being particularly justified, it is the minister who actually gets off his butt and gets things done&mdash;as opposed to opposition members who sat on their butts for the entirety of the time they were given the trust of the public&mdash;who, nevertheless, is subject to criticism from them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the ANL. The ANL has been losing money virtually since its inception, apart from a small period of profitability 20 or 30 years ago and the odd year or two since then. But Laurie came into office with about two or three months to deal with the situation. He got down and dealt with it. He is a minister who acts and acts effectively, as opposed to the drivel opposite who wander around the place like a Greek chorus. The opposition, after 11 or 12 years in that position, has become a parliamentary Greek chorus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you have ever watched one of those Greek plays, you will have noticed a bunch of claquers who appear behind a person to award applause if they happen to like a particular person but, if they do not like him or if they do not like the views he is putting forward, they do not actually argue about it. They just say, `Oh, no. Oh, no.' That is what opposition backbenchers have been reduced to whenever any active minister on this side of the House stands up to defend himself. They are a Greek chorus in this place, a constant moan of `Oh no. Come here and answer a few questions for us. Oh, no.' This is the ranting, prattling, grizzling of the totally politically impotent. Like members of the Greek chorus in Greek plays receive no reward, neither should opposition members receive a reward for what they are doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then opposition members get stuck into the minister on the subject of the CAA. They have to modify their positions in relation to the CAA because all of the reforms introduced into the CAA have been introduced to the Greek chorus. While the government has put in place those reforms, the Greek chorus has been saying, `Not enough. Go faster. Still too many bureaucrats. Get rid of them. Trust the industry.' That has been the Greek chorus chant from the opposition over the last three or four years: `You impose too many burdens on the industry. Let people take care of themselves. Deregulate totally. Allow them to stand up and do as they see fit. You are costing the country, the taxpayer and the industry too much by putting in place too tight a surveillance of these operations.' Opposition members who follow these issues know that is true. They know that is the argument they have been making. We have a few inquiries in place at the moment to determine whether or not this is true, but it now seems possible that more substantial independent regulation&mdash;not less&mdash;is required of the civil aviation industry. If that is the case, then it is a course of action which until this point in time has not been advocated by a single member opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the opposition has manifestly failed to do in all its criticisms of the minister in relation to the CAA is point substantially to one instance where, when a complaint has been raised with the minister, he has not properly dealt with it in terms of the framework which he has been given. The only exception&mdash;in fact, it is no exception because he requested it&mdash;was to get from the opposition spokesman some indication on that. The opposition spokesman said, `I won't give it to you, and I won't give it to your department. I will give it to a parliamentary inquiry, and they will consider it. You don't need to.' So what they are supposed to do about that when they get presented with it, God knows. One thing they cannot do with it is actually use it as a substantive basis for investigating an operator in the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subject to that, the logical position of the opposition is that it assumes that ministers ought to get out there and do the operational checks, the flight standards checks and the rest of it. What a load of nonsense! What a load of rubbish! You will get an opportunity to have a chat to Laurie at question time tomorrow. You can hold your horses until then. There is no justification for the motion to suspend standing orders. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Act Repeal Bill, which is before the House, will repeal the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Act 1980. The uranium export levy was introduced in 1980 to fund environmental monitoring and research activities associated with uranium mining in the Alligator Rivers Region of the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These activities are carried out by the Commonwealth government's Office of the Supervising Scientist, which was established by the Commonwealth in 1978 following the Fox inquiry into uranium mining. The role of the Office of the Supervising Scientist was envisaged to provide guarantees to the Australian people that the environment in the Alligator Rivers Region would not be adversely affected by uranium mining. Research has been carried out on the impact of mining on the environment in that region for 15 years by the Alligator Rivers Region Research Institute. Uranium mining operations have been under way for some 13 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Due to the government's supposed three mines uranium policy, only one mine operates in the region. It is important to again reiterate that the three mines policy is a sham in that there are only two mines&mdash;Olympic Dam in South Australia and Ranger&mdash;which are still operating. The Ranger mine, as so many members would know, is located east of the township of Jabiru in a project area of some 80 square kilometres in size. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is the last legislative action in a package of measures the government claims will streamline and refocus the Commonwealth's involvement in the Alligator Rivers Region of the Northern Territory. The previous measures included: the incorporation of the Office of the Supervising Scientist into the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency to reduce administrative duplication and achieve economies of scale; refined mechanisms for consulting key stakeholders; the conferring on the minister the authority to seek advice from the Supervising Scientist on environmental matters outside of the Alligator Rivers Region; the enabling of the Alligator Rivers Region Research Institute to undertake research on matters outside the region on a commercial basis; and the establishment of an independent review of the research now needed to meet the Commonwealth's environment protection objectives in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Questions about the effectiveness and appropriateness of the Office of the Supervising Scientist date back to the Taylor review of 1989, commissioned by the then Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. The Taylor review argued that the structure, function and distribution of expertise within the Office of the Supervising Scientist should be critically reviewed. The jury is still out on whether or not the government's package of measures will be effective in curing some of the inherent weaknesses of the Office of the Supervising Scientist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year, when the rest of the measures I previously mentioned were agreed to by the parliament, the Northern Territory government queried the role of the Office of the Supervising Scientist. Its opinion was that the Office of the Supervising Scientist is too large and has an excessive number of staff. The substance behind these criticisms of the Northern Territory government is that uranium mining in the Northern Territory is also subject to regulation by the Department of Mines and Energy of the Northern Territory. The need for Commonwealth oversight is questionable, particularly when the other operating uranium mine at Roxby Downs in South Australia is not subject to a similar duplication of government oversight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Office of the Supervising Scientist exists principally because the Ranger uranium mine exists. Given this crucial link, the views of the operator, Energy Resources of Australia, ERA, are important in any review of the effectiveness of the Office of the Supervising Scientist. ERA has consistently pointed out that, as owner and operator of the mine, it has first-hand knowledge and a comprehensive understanding of how to protect the environment in which it is working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The merit of this claim clearly rests on ERA's 14-year history in operating Ranger without any detriment to the environment outside the mine site. This clean bill of health has been confirmed by both the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory governments. ERA funds research into weed control, fire management, feral animal control, and fish and emu breeding for Aborigines. The company conducts open days and publicly releases the results of its environmental monitoring and research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ERA is now fielding inquiries from prospective customers around the globe wanting access to ERA's expertise in environmental services. These skills include water analysis and management in a monsoonal climate and innovative techniques for rehabilitation of vegetation. Furthermore, in 1993, the company won the prestigious Australian Minerals and Energy Environmental Foundation Award for environmental excellence and the Northern Territory Landcare Award for research and innovative technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With such a strong commitment to environmental issues by ERA, it is not surprising that the relationship between ERA and the Commonwealth government has matured to encompass considerable cooperation. Joint audits of environmental performance are now carried out, and a cooperative research program with the Commonwealth is under way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This cooperation is also evident in the terms of the bill before the House. The government now recognises the inequity of the export levy paid by ERA alone to fund the Office of the Supervising Scientist. The levy was intended to capture funds for environmental research from a number of mines in the region. However, the government prevented any other mines from opening. As a result, the levy now falls solely on the Ranger mine operated by ERA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Community benefits unrelated to uranium mining also arise from the Office of the Supervising Scientist, for which ERA is paying. To end this inequitable situation, the government has reached agreement with ERA that the levy be scrapped if ERA contributes $1 1/2 million annually, indexed by inflation and subject to review after two years. Clearly, there is considerable scope for future cooperation to occur between the Commonwealth and ERA when this arrangement is reviewed in two years time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was with great disappointment that many Australians witnessed the happenings of the Labor Party National Conference in Hobart a fortnight ago. For a time there, albeit a fleeting moment, it seemed that commonsense would prevail and the Labor Party would abolish its restrictive three&mdash;but in reality two&mdash;mines policy. We know that a number of mines could come on stream almost immediately or in the near future, including the Koongarra mine in the Northern Territory, which the traditional Aboriginal landowners support. We know that North Ranger, 15 kilometres north of the existing Ranger mine, is also a candidate for immediate opening. In Western Australia there is the Kintyre and Yeelirrie mines, all of which could become commercial ventures in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worst aspect of the whole uranium debate as it engulfed the Labor Party was the spurious arguments put up against the lifting of the three-mine policy. We already know that there are no environmental or occupational and safety grounds for opposing the opening of new mines. Both the Ranger mine and the Roxby Downs mine have an exemplary record in this regard, as has been acknowledged by environment and resource ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In their desperation, the opponents of an expansion of the uranium industry in Australia clung to economic arguments. There was an argument that there was already an oversupply of uranium in the world and to the extent that there might be an undersupply&mdash;and they are prepared to concede that there might be an undersupply&mdash;it could be met by expanding supply from Roxby Downs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure honourable members that, if I were a shareholder in a uranium company, I know whose market intelligence I would prefer to rely on&mdash;the companies, rather than any politicians or public activists. The government's own principal economic forecasting agency, ABARE, released a report in February showing that the uranium market will strengthen by the late 1990s. The government needed to abolish its restrictions on uranium mining so as to take advantage of growing demand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABARE report said that the spot price for uranium contracts would double over the rest of the decade, rising from around $US10 per pound at the moment to $US21 per pound by 1998. The report found that inventories held by overseas utilities are running down rapidly and the consumption of uranium oxide has been running at twice the rate of production. Obviously, this would provide Australia's low cost producers with the best chance yet to grab a bigger share of an increasingly lucrative export market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will not even allow a new mine to come on stream to meet its own three-mine quota. We are handing hundreds of millions of export dollars to the Canadians, who command 30 per cent of the world's exports but only 10 per cent of the uranium reserves. Between 1982 and 1992 the Canadians earned almost $8 billion from uranium exports, but Australia earned less than half of that. Australia, with 30 per cent of the world's uranium reserves and proven world class deposits, is handing the game entirely over to Canada. The deterioration in the current account means that Australia has to take up any opportunity for increased exports. There is no logical basis for continuing with Labor's three-mine uranium policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In August, Access Economics delivered a report on uranium prospects which destroyed once and for all any economic justification for the restrictive three-mine uranium policy. When one reads that Access Economics report, one sees that there is not a shred of credibility for any economic argument against uranium mining. The independent report exposed the three-mine policy as an economic absurdity. The report forecasts that uranium exports would reach $1 billion annually by the year 2004 if mining were unrestricted. Exports of this order would be five times the present value, and achieved in only a decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the three mines policy continues, the report found, Canada's share of the market will increase to 40 per cent by the year 2004, while Australia's share dwindles to under 20 per cent. The report concludes that net benefits to Australia would be up to $1.6 billion by the year 2010 if restrictions on mining were removed. Canada, it hardly needs to be said, will gladly take the $1.6 billion if the Labor Party continues to deny Australia the opportunity to earn this extra income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was an opportunity at the Labor Party's September conference to lift the restrictions so that mines could quickly lock in contracts and be ready to export when demand rises in the next few years. In the face of the ABARE report and the Access Economics report, the government cannot persevere any longer with its patently false arguments for a three-mine uranium policy. Australia's economic future must take precedence over Labor's factional politics. That is all that the conference in Hobart showed us: it convinced the Labor Party to retain the three-mine policy. It is purely factional warfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) himself invested a great deal of his authority and standing for a change in the three-mine policy but quickly abandoned it when he found, after testing the water, that he was likely to lose. But there is no doubt at all that, if the right wing faction had stayed as one, then with the Centre Left a change in the policy would have been effected against the opposition of the left wing. But the right wing itself was hopelessly divided largely because of the thuggery of the Australian Workers Union, who introduced into the debate&mdash;and which guided their decision&mdash;their warfare with CRA on another entirely unrelated industrial issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Steve Harrison, who is the leader of that powerful right wing and previously pro-uranium Australian Workers Union, was reported in August as pushing for a change to the right wing's previous support for uranium as retaliation for the mining giant CRA's industrial relations record. So the AWU wrecked the national interest over a single industrial issue. When one examines that industrial issue, what the AWU fears is freedom of choice: employers at the Comalco company's Bell Bay site in Tasmania and at Hamersley Iron in the Pilbara have offered their employees a choice&mdash;a choice to be employed on staff conditions or to remain on award conditions. There is no exclusion of union membership at all. This is simply a union refusing to accept the decision of its own rank and file, people who freely make up their minds as to what their terms and conditions of employment will be and, correspondingly, whether or not they will continue in the union. So the three-mine policy was held hostage to the ambitions of the AWU, to punish CRA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no logic to the Labor Party's decision on the three-mine policy. On what grounds could the Labor Party continue the three-mine policy and damage the national interest in the way it has? Canadian exports of uranium oxide have lived off the back of the ALP's policy for 10 years. With the projected upturn in the uranium market just around the corner, the union, with coverage over Australia's major mines, was hell-bent on delivering still more jobs to Canada. The AWU should be ashamed of itself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Act Repeal Bill 1994, I would like to say that the trouble with such bills is that so often we get a regurgitation of the minister's second reading speech, a diatribe from the parliamentary <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> or, as in the case of the previous speaker in this debate, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), total irrelevance. He spent most of his time attacking the Australian Labor Party's uranium policy, which I happen to believe is incredibly stupid but it certainly has nothing to do with this bill. So, Mr Deputy Speaker, I expect your indulgence when I stray from this bill, as I intend to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am perplexed when reading the bill to see that the reason for removing the levy on ERA&mdash;which started at 11c a kilogram and rose to $1.30 a kilogram&mdash;was that it was inequitable. It clearly is. This will no longer be the case but the company will make a comparable contribution. If it is argued that the levy made the company unviable vis-a-vis other mines, such as Roxby Downs&mdash;and clearly that was the case&mdash;it seems to me that the situation is not improved by expecting the company to make up the difference in a direct grant to the government. That just does not add up. I guess this is what the church would call a mystery. I would certainly like to be enlightened as to how a company substantially benefits from the new arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that ERA has been very credible in its environmental work. So has every other major Australian mining company. Australian mining companies are amongst the leaders&mdash;not just in Australia, but in the world&mdash;in environmental matters and revegetation. We ought to look at the situation. The Office of the Supervising Scientist started because of widespread community concern about the effect of uranium mining in the Alligator Rivers valley. These concerns had very little to do with science and an awful lot to do with emotion. There has been no problem there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is basically a chemical one. There is no doubt that uranium, which occurs very commonly in the soil&mdash;it is a very frequently occurring mineral in nature&mdash;locks up through ionic bonding with clay and simply does not go anywhere. That has been the experience in the Alligator Rivers and it is also the experience in the United States where for many years now at Oakridge laboratories the Americans have been burying in clay low to medium grade atomic waste. They have found that it has bonded totally and has gone nowhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The environmentalists will argue that it could be leached out. It could, but it would require very strong acid to do so&mdash;certainly not the sorts of acids that occur in nature or are ever likely to occur in nature. We never hear the environmentalists or greenies say that salt lakes, which are caused by ionic bonding&mdash;and most of them were caused long before white man came to this nation&mdash;could disappear. They will not disappear because the ionic bonding between the sodium ions and the clay is very strong. Yet we hear the environmentalists raising these unrealistic doubts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, in Australia today, we have seen so often the emotion and the science fiction overriding the hard science, the rationality and the logic. This occurs not only in factors such as this where we are dealing with hard science but also in other areas. I put this down, in part, to the very young age of members of the press gallery and, obviously, to the lack of general education in that institution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that concerns me about the Office of the Supervising Scientist is that it is now being incorporated into the Commonwealth's environmental section, headed up by Mr Barry Carbon. When he headed up the Environment Protection Authority in Western Australia, a body unique in Australia because it inappropriately has enormous power, he was both the chairman and the chief executive officer, a position which I find to be curious, to say the least, and one which I believe should never be promoted or allowed. It is true that he does not have quite the same power in the Commonwealth system but, given the nature of the man, we have to be concerned that we are not going to see a zealousness in the pursuit of empire building that will also subvert scientific evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has to be concerned about the federal environment department. I refer particularly to the environmental strategies directorate. I will quote from what is, I suppose, the duty statement of this directorate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Directorate comprises seven elements of the Environmental Strategies Sub-program. The Directorate's role is to advise on, develop and secure the integrated implementation of policies and programs for protection and conservation of the environment. It is particularly concerned with cross-cutting, longer term environmental issues and with issues of high priority and concern to a number of portfolio agencies. Its work is undertaken through an analysis and coordination group and through a strategic policy development group. Through the former group, it deals with issues such as trade and environment; the development of implementation, marketing and review mechanisms for domestic environment initiatives including Agenda 21, NSESD&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>whatever that means&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and IGAE; natural resource accounting; the development of economic instruments; coordination of international relationships in the environment; and liaison with NGO's industry, State and local governments. Through the latter group, it deals with administration of the World Heritage Convention; implementation of the Biodiversity Convention; implementation of the Climate Change Convention and the National Greenhouse Response Strategy&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and so on. These are very important issues, many of which are turning out to be simply hocus-pocus. I do not think anyone who has a logical, rational look at greenhouse, or the greenhouse scare that was raised, could say other than that this was a gigantic hoax perpetrated on the world basically in the pursuit of more research funds for a very disreputable cause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worrying thing here is that the executive director of this very powerful department is none other than Phillip Toyne. Phillip Toyne's history is a curious one. It started off in Aboriginal affairs. When he had maximised his exploitation of the Aboriginal industry, he moved in as head of the Conservation Foundation. As head of the Conservation Foundation, he was never prepared to look at what is probably the second most important environmental factor in Australia today: city pollution and the effect of increased population growth and immigration. He discarded it because, in his view, it was not politically correct. We now see him heading this very important directorate. One can only ask: what are his qualifications for such an appointment? Given his appalling track record, it is a very dangerous appointment. I can only be very thankful that the minister has the last say and that the authority is not a law unto itself, as it is in Western Australia under the Environment Protection Authority legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning once more to this legislation, which I am prepared to do occasionally, the bill is a very commonsense, ordinary piece of legislation. It is the sort of legislation I cannot imagine being opposed by the opposition, and the legislation is probably overdue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say a few things about the contribution of the honourable member for Gippsland. What he said about the Labor Party's uranium policy is absolutely true: it is a nonsense policy. There is no doubt about that. What he failed to say, however, is that during the years the Fraser government was in power it never changed the policy. Not only did it not change the policy but it did not even allow existing mines to sell additional quotas from their resources, and it was left to an incoming Labor government to make that very sensible change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a little nauseating having members of the opposition coming in here to pontificate on this matter when the Fraser government had an absolute mandate. It had not only a majority in this place but a majority in the Senate. It had the world at its feet, an absolute mandate and absolute power, and it did nothing. The Fraser government had an opportunity to change that policy at a time when it should have been changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that, because of the enormous invaluable work done by Julian Grill at the conference, the opportunity has not been irrevocably lost. The policy has been sent off to a committee, from which we can recover the opportunity to change it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy is flawed, it is politically expedient and it is costing this country hundreds of millions of dollars a year. It is costing us jobs, including jobs for Aboriginals, and it denies Australia a greater say in the world nuclear energy scene. If the policy that is held by this Labor government were held by any other party, that party would be roundly condemned in the media every day. It would be the subject of ridicule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that a lot has been written about this policy, but it has had more to do with the machinations of Labor Party lobbying than ridiculing the party itself. As we read this bill, it is very instructive to reflect on how the government came to its present position. The Labor Party platform of 1957 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We urge, nevertheless, that nuclear research to hasten the application of atomic power for industrial purposes be encouraged in the development of Australia. Further, we demand the protection and safeguarding of Australia by the retention here of basic raw materials and the necessary manufacturing and industrial processing rights so as to ensure this country's self-sufficiency in time of emergency or conflict.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a remarkable position when we look at the one held today. In both its 1969 and 1971 platforms, the Labor Party urged an early initiative for the building of nuclear power stations in this country. In 1974 the then minister was Mr Connor&mdash;the person who had prevented Australia's export of uranium overseas back in the days when we were receiving a very high price for uranium, somewhere in the order of $US40 a pound. His platform, which was the government's platform, was fulfilling the ambition of having a 100 per cent Australian government owned uranium enrichment plant, a central government owned uranium mill in the Northern Territory and a government part ownership in uranium mining companies. There we have it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we turn to November 1976, it is very interesting to see that the genesis of the present three-mine policy was with the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when he held the portfolio of resources and energy. He, in conjunction with former Senator Button, drew up a program that provided for existing contracts for uranium mining to be honoured providing that no new mining developments were permitted to take place. It is not dissimilar to the situation we have today with Ranger and Olympic Dam. So that logic started back then with the present Prime Minister. Indeed, at the ALP conference in July 1977, the present Prime Minister proposed that the 1976 caucus decision should stand and that there should be a two-year moratorium on uranium mining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mine that we are debating today, the Ranger uranium mine, was opened in November 1981. The following year, again at the ALP national conference, the party reaffirmed its policy not to allow any new uranium mines, which meant that Nabarlek and Ranger could continue to be mined. In other words, they had a two-mine policy in those days and wanted to phase out Australia's involvement in the uranium industry overall. But, in October 1982, Mr Bannon, with an election coming up, announced that Roxby Downs was to go ahead. So, in November 1983, federal cabinet approved the mining of Roxby Downs with a caucus vote of 55 to 46, but again there was a clause to prevent the development of any other uranium mine. So we went from a two-mine policy to a three-mine policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In July 1984 the ALP held its national conference and clearly delineated the three mines policy, incorporating Nabarlek, Ranger and Roxby Downs, with any new mines prohibited. Two years later at the ALP national conference the uranium policy was not changed. However, just after that conference the ALP decided to resume sales of uranium to France to pull in some budget revenue. The government approved ERA, the present operator of the Ranger mine, supplying France with uranium over a 14-year period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In June 1988 the ALP held its annual conference, but nothing much had changed. In November that year Olympic Dam was opened. It was not long after that that spot prices for uranium fell from $US43 a pound to around $US10 a pound. As a result, Australia had missed several hundreds of millions&mdash;if not several billions&mdash;of dollars of export revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Shortly after that, former Senator Richardson, Bob Hogg, the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) and the former member for Werriwa, Mr Kerin, started to make very derogatory comments indicating that the three mines policy was an absolute nonsense. Nevertheless, on 3 April 1991 the then federal Treasurer, the present Prime Minister, while speaking at Port Pirie in South Australia, stated that Australia's three mines policy was well balanced. It is very hard to understand how a sane and rational man could come to such a conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, the Jabiluka Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory was lamenting the fact that it was prevented from reaping millions in benefits from royalties from the opening of new mines. At the ALP national conference in June that year uranium policy came up for debate and the three mines policy remained in place. We find ourselves in a totally ridiculous situation today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ranger uranium mine, operated by Energy Resources of Australia, is central to this bill. Ranger has provided the Australian people with $5.5 billion in export income. The mine is located in the catchment area of the South Alligator River. Olympic Dam mine in South Australia is operated by Western Mining. Nabarlek has been closed for some time because its economic supplies are exhausted. However, if the three mines policy&mdash;now the two mines policy&mdash;could be shafted, as it should be, we could open up other mines and capture a tremendous amount of export income for Australia. </PARA>

That is something which the government should bear in mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look at the recent comments of Access Economics.

We should be in the position today that Canada finds itself in. If we banish the three-mine policy, we could be supplying 30 per cent of the world's uranium by the year 2004, according to Access Economics. Other countries are filling our shortfall.

We are talking about an increase in revenue for this country of at least $450 million and the creation of hundreds of jobs that will benefit regional Australia and Aboriginal people, and the Prime Minister comes out and says it is `not really worth doing'.

The Queensland right wing, which is dominated by the Australian Workers Union, was against it at the ALP National Conference this year because it has this special deal with CRA to have exclusive coverage of mining sites. Because CRA wants to implement the government industrial relations policy and negotiate individual contracts with individual workers to the benefit of the mining industry and the workers as a whole, the AWU, which is supposed to be right wing, also voted against it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government were doing this because the world would be a safer place as a result, we could perhaps tolerate the situation. But one of the alternatives is that we burn more coal. If we do that, we get more sulfur dioxide being belched into the atmosphere. Strangely enough, we even get more radioactivity put out into the atmosphere as a by-product of coal burning. There is also an issue which the government might think is a small matter: the health of the coal miners themselves, particularly the underground miners who, over the centuries, have suffered from dreadful diseases such as black lung disease. The mines they work in are more prone to cave-ins and explosions, et cetera, which must be a terrible mental pressure to work under. </PARA>

If we look at the sales of uranium in the world since November 1976, when this Labor Party policy first came in, we will see that they have almost doubled. So Australia's policy on uranium mining has had absolutely no effect whatsoever. All we have done is squander jobs, money and the welfare of Aborigines.

There is only the Athabasca Basin in Canada that compares in richness with that uranium deposit anywhere in the world. What would 600,000 tonnes of uranium be worth if we could mine it and sell it today? I am told that it would be&mdash;depending on price&mdash;between $18,000 million and $36,000 million.

Overall, 57 per cent of people polled said that the environment was more important than economic growth and should be protected, whereas only 33 per cent said that the economy was more important than the environment.

It has changed the name of Jabiluka to Ranger 2. This has been done to confuse the general public in thinking that Ranger and Ranger 2 are the same mine.

While I had a sabbatical for three years&mdash;I lost my seat in parliament&mdash;I worked with Greenpeace for a short time as a lobbyist. I worked on retaining the ALP's policy on uranium mining.

Friends of the Earth opposed uranium mining because, it said, the price would go down in the future. It said this back in the 1980s and was ridiculed by North Broken Hill, ERA and the rest of them. Friends of the Earth said that the price of uranium could fall to as low as $US15 per pound and it was ridiculed by the uranium industry. The actual current price is $7.50 per pound.

There are lots of insects around this area because of the water and when the birds go after the insects they pick up the radioactive tailings on their feet, which would then be transferred straight to their nests. Who knows what the cumulative effect of this might be? I have actually taken photographs of animal tracks through this slurry tailings dam and I can see where dingos and various other animals have walked through it.

Japan, South Korea and Russia still have some under way. Canada has quite a few nuclear plants. It has been mining uranium. The uranium mines there are working at about 50 per cent capacity. In Australia, Ranger at Kakadu has been working at 50 per cent capacity; however, it fills about 30 per cent of its sales from contracts bought from the former USSR.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once a power station reaches the end of its operational life (typically 30 years or more), it is shut down and eventually dismantled. In the case of nuclear power stations, this latter stage is complicated by the radioactivity of the structures that remain after the uranium fuel has been removed. This radioactivity arises either because of contamination from the spent fuel or from the bombardment of the reactor walls, pipes etc. by neutrons. These subatomic particles, which sustain the heat-generating chain reaction in the uranium, may also collide with stable atoms in the surrounding structures converting them to unstable&mdash;radioactive&mdash;atoms.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what is happening in these nuclear reactors. This is what they talk about. Decommissioning of Magnox and AGR reactors was summarised as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once the fuel has gone, we will spend something of the order of #15 million tidying up the site and ensuring that the buildings are weatherproof.

We will build around the residual plant an engineered structure which is highly weatherproof and highly intruder resistant, and once the plant is inside that structure we will wait for the natural radioactivity decay to reduce the activity. At this stage you could send workers into those reactors to work and cut the thing up by hand.</PARA>
<PARA>The `deferred safe store' strategy would result in the final stage of decommissioning being delayed&mdash;this is the important point&mdash;by 135 years.

I again remind honourable members that this bill deals with the repeal of the uranium export duty. The duty will be replaced by an annual contribution by Energy Resources of Australia Ltd of $1 1/2 million towards research into the environmental effects of uranium mining in the Alligator Rivers region of the Northern Territory. We as a government believe that the replacement of the duty by an annual contribution by Energy Resources of Australia will result in a streamlined, more focused, cost-effective Commonwealth involvement in the Alligator Rivers region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill was passed with minor amendments in the Senate with bipartisan support on 31 August this year. To recapitulate what I said earlier in my second reading speech, I shall talk about the history of the uranium export duty. In 1980, the Fraser Liberal government introduced an export duty on uranium exported from the Alligator Rivers region to collect an industry contribution towards the special costs incurred by the Commonwealth in implementing arrangements. This was to ensure that no adverse environmental impacts arose from uranium mining operations in the region. At the time, it was thought that there would eventually be several mines operating in the region, and there was no direct link between the duty collected and the costs of the Office of the Supervising Scientist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The duty was originally set at 11c per kilogram and has risen progressively since that time to its present level of $1.30 per kilogram, as the government has sought full recovery of the cost of running the important office of the Office of the Supervising Scientist. As part of a package of measures to deal with this issue, the government decided to apply an appropriate mechanism for collecting an industry contribution. We have taken into account that there have been difficulties in collecting a precise amount in any year, leading to uncertainty for both Ranger and the Commonwealth. We also took the view that the duty was inequitable. Ranger's competitor, Olympic Dam, was not required to pay such a duty, nor was any other mine operating in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We further recognised that there was a wider community benefit from the activities of the Office of the Supervising Scientist to protect the environment in the region, and that Ranger should not be required to bear the full cost of those activities. The government also seeks to attribute to Ranger a level of contribution which reflects as closely as possible the costs associated with monitoring the environmental impact of its particular operations. As I said, this bill is receiving bipartisan support. The Democrats have supported the bill. The only opposition in the Senate came from the Western Australian Greens. This bill should be lauded, and I commend it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of these bills is to provide for amendments to a number of acts and passage of the Trade Marks Bill 1994 to enable Australia to accept the World Trade Organisation agreement by 1 January 1995. The World Trade Organisation agreement is the outcome of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. The agreement will provide a stimulus to the world economy, as well as a framework for the continuing conduct of international trade on a non-discriminatory and sustainable economic basis.

Of special interest to Australia are commitments on beef and sheep meat, dairy, grains, including rice, sugar, horticulture, coal, steel, pharmaceuticals, beer, medical equipment and non-ferrous metals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD has estimated that for agricultural and industrial products alone the Uruguay Round outcomes will result in an increase in global economic activity of up to $A418 billion by the year 2002.

Assessments by the Industry Commission suggest that there may be as much as a $5 billion increase in exports and a $A3.7 billion increase in Australian gross domestic product. These estimates include:</PARA>

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Agriculture</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>In the Uruguay Round, Australia took on the daunting task of bringing agriculture more fully into the international trading regime. Reform of the global agricultural system was, and still is, a top priority for Australia. It is an indication of the determination and solidarity of Australia and the Cairns Group&mdash;which Australia founded and chairs&mdash;that the round negotiations included a comprehensive mandate on agriculture, which led to a genuinely trade liberalising outcome. The negotiations have broken new ground by extending fully the rules and disciplines of the GATT to trade in agriculture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefits will flow from reform commitments on a formula basis to world agricultural trade in three major areas: market access, domestic support and export subsidies.

Over the next six years, there will be a major reduction in the level of trade distorting export subsidies. They are to be cut by 36 per cent in value and by 21 per cent in volume. Domestic support will be cut by 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement on the application of sanitary and phytosanitary measures&mdash;the SPS agreement&mdash;will also assist Australian exporters in ensuring that such measures are only maintained to the extent necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health, and are scientifically justifiable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Neither the SPS agreement nor the agreement on technical barriers to trade, the revised standards code, will alter Australia's ability to maintain more stringent measures than provided for in international standards if this is appropriate to our requirements.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With our Cairns Group members, we will need to work to ensure that the round commitments are implemented fully and promptly.

<PARA>The purpose of this bill is to amend the Dairy Produce Act 1986 by terminating market support payments to the Australian dairy industry for exports beyond 30 June 1995. The current dairy market support payments, which were introduced in the 1986 dairy plan, are classified as an export subsidy under the Uruguay Round agreement. Australia is committed to reduce export subsidies over the period 1995-96 to 2000-01 by 36 per cent in expenditure terms and by 21 per cent in volume from the base period of 1986-90. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the current market support payments are not constructed in a manner which enables the volume of supported exports to be reduced, a revised approach is necessary. The government and the dairy industry have agreed to a two-stage approach. The first stage comprises the amendments of this bill to terminate market support payments for the Australian dairy industry for exports beyond 30 June 1995, thereby satisfying Australia's commitments on subsidies by removing the export subsidy. In the event of the WTO agreement not coming into force until after 1 July 1995, provision is made for the termination of the market support payment scheme to be delayed until the first day of the next financial year after the financial year when the agreement enters into force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second stage will involve the introduction of legislation in the autumn sittings next year, amending the Dairy Produce Act 1986 to enable the implementation of a new domestic market support mechanism to apply from 1 July 1995 until 30 June 2000.

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Tariff reductions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second major category of Uruguay Round outcomes is tariff reductions. The Uruguay Round achieved the biggest market access tariff reductions package ever in GATT negotiations. Overall, tariffs facing Australia's exports will be cut on average by around 50 per cent on a trade weighted basis. More than 86 per cent of Australia's exports will now enjoy predictable market access through bound tariff commitments by most of our major trading partners. The average bound tariff rate facing Australian exports of industrial products will be less than two per cent on a trade weighted basis while nearly 50 per cent of Australia's exports will enjoy duty-free access to significant markets. </PARA>

While more than 95 per cent of Australia's tariffs will be bound, in general these commitments will be at levels above the current applied tariff rates or the rate which will apply when the current program of tariff reductions has been fully implemented. Based on Industry Commission analysis, the export gains for industrial products will be about $3 billion per annum when the majority of the cuts are implemented by 1 January 1999. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a few motor vehicle parts, some technical adjustments will be made to bring certain tariff lines into conformity with our GATT obligations. These products&mdash;which include clutches and gaskets, air conditioning components, electric motors and electrical components&mdash;are part of a larger group of products that were recently restored to the motor vehicle plan. As a consequence, the tariffs were temporarily raised to 15 per cent, consistent with the industry rate for this sector. The tariffs on the 12 lines affected will be phased down to the bound rates negotiated in the round. In all cases the final tariff level will remain at or above rates which have applied in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a small number of agricultural products, some modest additional tariff cuts will also be required beyond the government's tariff reduction program.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The differential in taxes between fruit juice which has 25 per cent or more Australian content and other juices is not consistent with this principle. However, Australia has been able to retain this tax arrangement because of the `grandfather' clause allowing countries joining the GATT to apply the multilateral rules to the fullest extent not inconsistent with their own legislation existing when they joined.

Non-alcoholic carbonated beverages must consist wholly of juices from fruit or vegetables grown in Australia, New Zealand or Papua New Guinea for the concessional rate to apply.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I indicate to the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) at the outset that the coalition will be supporting the legislation. However, the opposition reserves its right to pursue some amendments to the Customs Legislation (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill, the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill and the Dairy Produce (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill and also reserves its right to pursue certain procedures in relation to this legislation to enable careful consideration in the Senate, particularly in light of what the government has done, or not done, with regard to some of the industries which are dealt with by this very important legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that it is time for plain speaking in respect of trade. I begin by clearly stating that there is no such thing as an international level playing field, but it is how we address the problems that arise from that that becomes critical. It has taken some seven years for the Uruguay Round to be finalised. One could be forgiven for thinking that this important process of global trade liberalisation was a matter to be resolved between the USA and Europe&mdash;the fact that this is how it emerged was the reason, in part, that it has taken so long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Stated simply, the United States and more so the European Community put their subsidised vested interests ahead of the interests of the global community. Let me say that I take no heart from that in terms of future outcomes for world trade activity, but I will return to that in a moment. The delays that dogged the bringing of the round to a conclusion potentially had far-reaching implications for the world trade situation. For instance, we need look no further than the NAFTA arrangements brought into being as a hedge against the failure of the round and for other purposes. Be under no illusion that NAFTA, an agreement between Mexico, the United States and Canada, would have operated as a closed trading bloc if the round had failed. I do not need to draw pictures of the impact that that would have had on world trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the European free trade agreement would also have raised the drawbridge against the intrusion of trade from elsewhere. In other words, the failure of the Uruguay Round would have encouraged the emergence of dangerous and discriminatory trade blocs. Even now, on 18 October, the potential for a discriminatory trade bloc in our immediate region cannot be written off, notwithstanding the advent of GATT. I refer to the report of the APEC Eminent Persons Group in this regard. Notwithstanding the rhetoric of the report that expresses contrary objectives, the fact is that it does not rule out completely some form of trade discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently reread an article in a 1988 copy of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Asian Defence Journal</EMPHASIS>. It quotes a report written by the Nomura Institute which, although a thesis, presented a chilling prediction of what might have been with regard to trade. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pax Americana is on the wane. The world is dividing into four economic blocks of almost equal strength. They are the United States, the European Community, the [former] Soviet bloc countries, and the West Pacific Basin countries with the pivot being Japan.</PARA>
<PARA>The Nomura Institute hoped that this new era would usher in growing interdependence among these blocs. The fear is that the new era could usher in conflict, rather than cooperation, between these blocs. The year 1988 was a long way from the year 1993, when the final phase of the Uruguay Round was completed. However, the longer that round and those negotiations dragged on, the longer the bickering and the failure to agree became a persistent feature of the round negotiations. I actually came to wonder whether that particular thesis might have had some currency. I am pleased that, at the end of the day, it did not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some 122 trading nations gathered at Marrakesh in April 1994 and signed off on the Uruguay Round. That does not mean that they have signed away Australia's sovereignty and Australia's ability to take sovereign action with regard to its industries and its trading purpose but it does mean that they have taken a step forward in the interests of the Australian economy and its future direction, the standard of living of workers, and industry generally&mdash;be it manufacturing industry or primary industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people would say that the work has only just begun, and I must say that I am one of those people. In other words, we have a long way to go before the task of reforming world trade is completed. One issue that needs to be resolved is the admission of China, Taiwan and Vietnam to GATT. The coalition believes that the admission of the two Chinas to the GATT is not only important but also essential. China, prospectively the world's largest economy, simply cannot be left out of the equation, and the current opposition to China's admission from the United States is out of step with majority sentiment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue that needs to be addressed is the potential for backsliding on deals that have already been made. In my view, the fact that it has taken seven years to bring the round to finalisation is indicative of just how sensitive some of the issues involved have become. Because an element of horse-trading was clearly involved&mdash;an element of pressure was applied in order to bring some of the less willing around&mdash;it seems to me that the opportunity is now there for those countries that compromised to renege on the commitments they made when intent is translated to reality. In other words, we need to watch this space very closely indeed to see that the commitments given by the nations who signed off on the Uruguay Round are adhered to and honoured.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank the honourable member for Calare and a number of other members of this House who, over many years, have contributed to the development of Creative Nation, which was delivered today by the Prime Minister. I think that the opposition's antics today on this and other issues demonstrate its lack of vision in a number of areas. If the opposition leader had had his way and all of the $250 million was spent on the National Museum in Canberra, there would not have been substantial funds available for an investment in Australia's future&mdash;an investment in ensuring that we do have the creative infrastructure for this much hyped information superhighway. I think it is very important to take the steps that we are taking today to ensure that Australia is well positioned for the jobs, the investment and the export earnings that will flow from the use of these new technologies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But most importantly of all it is ironic that, at the very time this convergence in telecommunications, broadcasting and computing makes it easier for us to talk to and communicate information and text with each other in our own country, it also becomes much easier for people in other countries to dump their products on us. There is a real danger that that homogenised mass international culture can dominate us to a greater extent than is the case at the moment, despite the fact that we have local content rules on television and that we have industry policies that seek to ensure we have a viable computing industry here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government believes that we can bring together the best of our creators in film, television and other areas with the best of our computer programmers and ensure that Australia is at the leading edge of the development of this new industry. We are doing that by putting substantial funds into the establishment of an organisation called the Australia Multimedia Enterprise. Australia Multimedia Enterprise will seek to ensure that we stimulate investment from the private sector in some of these areas&mdash;not just in CD-ROMs, as one of the commentators in the gallery put it earlier today, and not just in the hardware of the discs. If we can invest funds in the development of new Australian software which at the moment is put on CD-ROM, then in the not too distant future it might be on-line on PCs and a few years after that be available in an interactive capacity on broadband networks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people are saying, `The communications technology is changing so rapidly we should wait.' Some people, like those on the opposition benches, are saying, `We're not quite ready yet to work out what's the best way to invest money in this industry.' They want to put all their money into the museum in Canberra. The people who are arguing that we should wait until we know what is going to happen in communications are the sorts of people who would have said that Colonel Parker should have told Elvis Presley to wait until CDs came out before he recorded anything on vinyl. The software that can be established now and put on CD-ROM today&mdash;whether it be the collection of the National Gallery, the collection from the National Museum or a new interactive CD such as that produced by the Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies&mdash;can be used to give school children and other Australians a chance to access these national collections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also ensuring that we are putting funds into multimedia development centres, which will be very ably administered by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, to ensure that we have the right training in place for the use of this new technology. In addition to that, we will be putting funds into the Australian Film, Television and Radio School so that the industry itself can ensure that its current staff can develop the skills to use this new technology. This will enable Australia to be at the cutting edge, leading the way in this and other areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, there will be a stark difference between this side of the House and those in the opposition as to what is happening on this new technology. They are talking about what they might do some time in the future. They put out the Cultural Frontier a couple of weeks ago. How many dollars of expenditure did it promise? Zero. How many motherhood statements did it contain? A lot more than the dollars they promised to spend. Even the name of it&mdash;the Cultural Frontier&mdash;sounded like some American outpost in Disneyland. We should contrast the concrete promises that the government has put forward today&mdash;the fact that we will be spending substantial sums of money in the next four years&mdash;with the opposition's empty motherhood rhetoric and zero attempts to provide any real funds to the Australian artistic community.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XS4">Dr LAWRENCE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is important for members of the House and the community generally to be aware of this very important week. Sadly, there is an overlap to some extent because we have mental health week at the same time as carers week. But some of the same matters are relevant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Carers week, I am pleased to say, has been supported by Commonwealth funding and is clearly supported by the opposition. I see the opposition spokesman and the Leader of the National Party wearing badges which suggest that they also support this week. I think we all need to recognise the very significant contribution that carers make, often without recompense. They have been described as unsung heroes by the media and heroines, for that matter, because many of them in fact are women who provide a valuable contribution to the community. They do deserve our support&mdash;both financial and moral.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been acknowledged that the federal government has recognised the importance of carers in budgetary terms. I remind members of the House and members of the community that we do support them, both directly and indirectly at the moment, through a range of community programs&mdash;many of which, I would acknowledge, need expansion. We are engaging in consultation at the moment with carers under the banner of the International Year of the Family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But at the moment, we are providing home and community care programs, disability services, the Commonwealth respite for carers programs and the domiciliary nursing care benefit. As well, of course, members should be aware that the carers pension is also available through the Social Security system, because one of the major problems is obviously income support. The commitment to carers we have made is very clear in the 1992 budget: over four years we are to provide $93 million directly for carers support&mdash;and that includes the carers support kit, which I hope members will bring to the attention of their constituents; an expansion of respite care services through the Commonwealth respite and carers program; and, of course, there has also been an increase in and an indexation of the domiciliary nursing care benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the level of chatter on the opposition benches suggests that members are not interested in this matter, I think they should be because their constituents are very interested in these matters. I am very pleased to announce that, in the case of New South Wales, today I approved an additional $1.7 million to support the carers of frail older people and younger people with disabilities. That $1.7 million is part of some $41 million which has been allocated nationally under the respite for carers program. One of the things that consultations have very clearly shown is that respite care and respite needs are amongst the highest priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think, in this carers week, we all need to acknowledge not only the very significant work that is done by carers but also the need for governments and oppositions to take their problems seriously and to ensure that their constituents understand the support that is available to them. One of the things that is very clear is that sometimes carers operate without support that is available, and they do not take advantage of what is provided for them. So all members of this House have a responsibility to assist them in that respect.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Shortland for his question. Yes, I am aware of those claims, and  specifically of a letter in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 28 September. I am also aware that some interest was raised in this matter in the last sitting period by the member for O'Connor on a related issue of Vietnam servicemen's back pay and what they may be owed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that some former ADF members may not have received their entitlement to war service leave was brought to light recently following a routine pay inquiry from an ex-ADF member. Since that time, of course, there have been a number of inquiries from Vietnam veterans regarding war service leave. Each case is being examined as quickly as possible, remembering that those records date back some 20 years and, unfortunately, are handwritten, manual records.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, some of those who may not have received their entitlement could, unfortunately, include those who died in Vietnam. On this issue, I am pleased to inform the honourable member and other members in the House that last week I ordered my department to begin checking the records of the 501 Australian personnel who died in Vietnam to ascertain whether they received their entitlements to war service leave. In the case of those who did not receive their entitlements, I have instructed the department to locate the next of kin or relatives of those personnel who died and to ensure that any amounts owing to them are paid. On the wider issue, I take the opportunity to urge returned Vietnam veterans who think they did not receive their war service leave entitlement to contact the Defence Force pay accounting centre and have those claims processed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, Vietnam was a very difficult conflict, not the least because of the very divisive nature of that war amongst Australians here at home. While relatively very small amounts of money may be in question here to individuals involved, I believe&mdash;and I am sure the opposition spokesman and the member for Shortland and others who have commented on this matter would agree&mdash;that this is the very least that we can do for those people who gave their lives or risked giving their lives in an Australian uniform.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Gilmore for his question. I know of his longstanding interest in forestry issues. The national forest policy statement, as members would know, is the cornerstone of Australia's forest industry development.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and I think the opposition will be pleased with these results because it has decided that it actually loves Medicare these days. It joins nine out of 10 Australians, I am pleased to say, in that love affair. Recent research undertaken by the Health Insurance Commission, which it carries out on an annual basis, showed that nine out of 10 Australians support Medicare. That is some couple of percentage points ahead of last year's result. I think it is very important to indicate that in 1984, not long after the introduction of the current Medicare system, support for Medicare generally&mdash;and this is where the opposition has been stuck in its policy&mdash;was around 54 per cent. That has risen steadily every year not only amongst consumers but also amongst practitioners. Support for direct billing is now at 89 per cent.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most people claim satisfaction too with the performance of the Health Insurance Commission.

Here he is now, at the end of question time, when if he had wanted to he could have come into the House and explained the matter himself; he could have taken the questions which related to his portfolio that were directed to other ministers and he could have given us some information.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was not a long lunch that the Minister for Transport was engaged in. I think the Minister for Transport sat in his office, hiding behind his desk, watching the questions in the chamber. When he saw that the coast was clear, when there would be no chance of his being asked a question and having to account for himself, he came into the House. And here he is. So why, I ask, was he not available to answer questions earlier in the day? It makes a mockery of the excuses and arguments put by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the House that ministers cannot come to the House every day of the week because they are too busy dealing with government matters. Here the minister was given an opportunity to answer questions and he denied it. He did not come, but now he is in the House when the coast is clear.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps, as my colleague has pointed out, he was trying on a new pair of ski boots. Let me just see how clear the coast is for the Minister for Transport. Today the news that is capturing the attention of the country is the gross incompetence of this minister that has allowed the Australian aviation system to collapse into chaos. His incompetence and maladministration allowed that to happen. That is the nub of the argument. That is what the newspapers and the television and radio stations around Australia are reporting today. They are all talking about the  Minister  for Transport, about  his incompetence and maladministration, and about the chronic state of aviation safety around this country.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) pointed out yesterday, all the minister ever does is read the newspaper. The Minister for Transport said in the House yesterday that he only ever asked questions of the CAA chief executive officer because he had read things in the paper that had caused him concern. So the minister obviously does read the newspaper. If he did, then he would have given himself one big shock because of what Geoff Kitney wrote in today's paper. He wrote:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Brereton was ringing around to make sure that reporters covering the story understood he was going to leave no stone unturned in investigating the crash and its implications for air safety.</PARA>
<PARA>Geoff Kitney went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He conceded that the reporters who had been writing for many months that there was something terribly wrong with the administration of air safety in Australia had been right and that he had paid insufficient attention to their reporting.</PARA>
<PARA>He had paid insufficient attention to their reporting about the problems of air safety in Australia. The words of the minister have condemned him. In the words of the minister, he is guilty of the charges of maladministration and incompetence; yet yesterday he was telling us quite the opposite. Yesterday he said, `I have done everything that I could in order to ensure that the concerns that have been raised in the public arena over the last few months were being pursued to the best of my ability.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the process, he tried to blame me for not taking up some of the opportunities he claimed were presented to me by the CAA to provide details about claims I had made in a speech in the House in May this year. I will make this brief point, because it is one of the defences the minister has been leaning on in the last 24 hours: the claims I made in the House were followed by a letter from George Macionis&mdash;the then Director of Aviation Safety; he has since been sacked by the minister&mdash;asking me to respond to the claims I had made about corruption, not about the claims I had made about Seaview, Monarch, Winrye Aviation or Yanda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If honourable members had been listening, yesterday in the House they would have heard the minister trying to put a different twist on that. I did not respond because, as the minister would know, to do so would have invited those people in the CAA to sue me&mdash;as has happened to Con Sciacca and Gordon Scholes in this place over time. If the CAA's Director of Aviation Safety had written to me and asked me for details to back up the claims that I had made about those airlines, I could have quickly responded to him and said, `All you have to do is go to your own files because the details that verify the claims I have made have come from your own files. Don't bother me with things that waste my time because you've got those details there.' Those details were leaked to me from the CAA filing system, which verified those claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also need to recognise that the minister said, `I took these claims that the honourable member for Hume made to the CAA to have them checked out.' Did he? Yes, he did. He passed them on to the CAA. But what happened to them? The minister did not get a response from the CAA until 8 or 9 October&mdash;a couple of weeks after the Seaview crash. The minister put those claims in to the CAA for assessment in May, but he did not get a response until October. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this minister were on top of his job, he would not have waited till October for a verification and a checkout of those claims made by me. Within a couple of weeks of those claims he would have asked, `Where is that report on those claims made by the honourable member for Hume? Why haven't I got a response?' But he did not chase that up. The reason is that he was not interested; he was sitting on his hands not doing his job. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He was very busy. As his colleague the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) pointed out in the press in the last few days, `The minister has been too busy. We all feel sorry for him. We all think it must be very difficult for him to run those two important portfolios.' Difficult or not, he is not handling either portfolio particularly well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the minister was on the job trying to ensure that aviation safety was being pursued to the nth degree, he would have chased up the CAA to find out what had happened about the claims I made. He did not. The reason he did not is borne out in the words he gave to journalists in the press gallery following the Seaview Air crash, reported in an article written today by Geoff Kitney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to look at other aspects of the minister's administration of his portfolio with respect to aviation safety. Just yesterday, the minister announced that there would be a judicial inquiry into the CAA. What judicial inquiry will we have? Will it look at the broad context of the problems that surround the operation of the Civil Aviation Authority? We would all think that would be the logical thing to do. It sounded great at the time&mdash;the minister saying, `We have a problem with the CAA. I am the minister. I am on top of the job. I am going to fix this up. We are going to have a judicial inquiry.' But as we know with the New South Wales Labor Right, we have to look at the fine print. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fine print says, `We are not going to have an inquiry into the broad sweep of the CAA. It is going to be a very narrow, focused inquiry into the relationship between the CAA and Seaview Air.' So it is not going to be the broad sweeping inquiry that we need to restore Australia's faith in the Civil Aviation Authority. It is not going to be the broad sweeping inquiry we need to get to the root cause of the problems within the Civil Aviation Authority. It will be a very narrow, focused inquiry reporting back in January next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, this is not going to reveal all of the problems. If the Sir Laurence Street judicial inquiry is to have credibility and if it is to get to the root causes of the problems, it needs to be as broad as possible and to be given the opportunity to get down to the details. Yet the minister has ensured that it cannot. As a consequence of the way the Minister for Transport has set up this inquiry, nobody is going to be able to have confidence in its findings. It is certainly not going to restore people's lost faith in the Civil Aviation Authority and air safety in Australia. If this minister were on top of his job, we would have seen some more action from him in the last few days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday we had the reply of the Chief Executive Officer of the CAA, Mr Doug Roser. It is an extraordinary reply. If this minister were doing his best, he would have done to Doug Roser what he did to George Macionis. He would have got rid of him, because it is quite plain that Mr Roser has not been doing properly the task that he has responsibility for. I ask the minister why it is that, after receiving a response such as the one he got from the chief executive officer, that man&mdash;who has been proven to have failed in his responsibility&mdash;is still in charge of the CAA at this time? I ask these questions because if you look at the problems, you need answers&mdash;and the answers are not forthcoming from the Minister for Transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to this House that there is, without any doubt, ample evidence to point out to the people of Australia and to the members of the parliament of Australia that the Minister for Transport has been negligent in his duties and that he has not worked diligently to ensure that aviation safety in this country is being maintained to the highest level. If he had, he would have acted a lot earlier. If the Minister for Transport had listened to and acted responsibly in relation to the concerns expressed by me, and the concerns expressed by the former chief pilot of Seaview Air about the problems with that company, he would have got to the causes of the problems months ago. Indeed, if the minister had acted earlier we probably would not need a judicial inquiry today. We would probably have a different board. We would probably have a different chief executive officer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sum consequence of the minister's negligence will mean that we are going to have a different Minister for Transport. There is only one thing that stands between the current Minister for Transport and the back bench&mdash;one person called Paul Keating, the Prime Minister of Australia. Do you know why? Because the Minister for Transport is a member of the Prime Minister's royal family. We all know that if you are one of the princes of the royal family, you can go out there and do as you want without any care or responsibility&mdash;knowing full well that, no matter how incompetent or negligent you are, you are going to be protected by your mate the Prime Minister. We saw it work for months and months with the member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) when she was the minister for the environment, fielding questions about the sports rorts affair. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest to the House and to the Minister for Transport, sitting opposite me now, that the same fate as the member for Canberra incurred will be incurred by him.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Your final call was for a parliamentary inquiry, and you cannot deny that you have been given that and that you are a member of it. That is the principal means of pursuing these matters. Of course, it has been supplemented by other measures, such as the police investigation and the judicial inquiry announced yesterday.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> These are, after all, the reforms that you wanted. These are the reforms that you have welcomed at every turn.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government responded immediately to the BASI report into Monarch with the detailed structural changes that I announced on 20 July: more resources so that the whole of the public interest is picked up in public funding; more inspection staff; new and comprehensive mandatory insurance arrangements, lifting the limit from $180,000 to $500,000; and that parliamentary investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We went further last week by establishing a separate aviation authority, which is another widely supported reform. At every step, we have referred people who have raised evidence of specific allegations to the appropriate authorities. I repeat that the parliamentary inquiry remains there for you to go to, and the judicial inquiry and the police inquiries supplement the parliamentary inquiry. If you have any material, for God's sake, come and put it forward. We have acted comprehensively in respect of everything that has been put before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that we have tackled the structural issue of aviation safety by deciding in the cabinet this week to establish a safety body independent of the Civil Aviation Authority. We have moved away from affordable safety and we have committed ourselves to some $29 million. I have to say that that is in stark contrast to your approach in Fightback where you said that you were going to move to a total user-pays approach, that you were going to take $20 million from the Civil Aviation Authority and that you were going to ensure that the aviation industry had to pay for every element of aviation safety, including search and rescue work. That is your Fightback policy, and in The Things That Matter you have never so much as thought about revising it. So we are in there at $29 million, up from $22 million, and your policy is still no cost recovery contribution from the Commonwealth at all; pick it all up from the industry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As he scurries out of the chamber, can I say that, of all the statements that he made in the last quarter of an hour, only one had any real substance. He said, `I have never shirked a difficult job in my life.' I would like to take him up on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would have thought that, when the minister first came into that portfolio after the last election, he would have wanted to make an impression on the Civil Aviation Authority which at that time was in bad shape. You might remember the Macphee inquiry into the contracts for the new radar systems in Australia; the fact that the chief executive officer and his assistant in that project had been fired by the government; that the CAA was in a state of near shock with morale amongst its employees having never been as low for at least 20-odd years&mdash;having never been as low since the time Charlie Jones took over as transport minister under the Whitlam administration. I would have thought that a new minister to that portfolio would have gone through his responsibilities; analysed the state of the CAA; and examined the membership of the board of that organisation and the competency of the chief executive officer and all the senior executives. But, in fact, nothing happened and nothing has happened since. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We go back to May when, after that particularly memorable debate in this place regarding the Monarch crash and the warnings that were given then to the government as to the state of commuter aviation in Australia, we were told that all sorts of things were going to happen&mdash;but, of course, they never did. As my colleague rightly pointed out a little earlier today, this minister had every opportunity to follow through those complaints and, by virtue of his position, an obligation to follow them up to ensure that the people of Australia had a safe aviation system which they could trust&mdash;and he failed that particular obligation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This minister is all words. Harking back over this last week to some of the statements the minister has made in this place, I give one example. I asked a question on Wednesday of last week regarding the status of the medical certificate of the pilot of that ill-fated aircraft which was on its way to Lord Howe Island. I asked whether that certificate was, in fact, out of date; it would appear it was. I asked for the status of the insurance and compensation claims of the victims of that particular crash. The minister said, well, he had heard these stories about it; he had heard that there might be some complication in providing insurance and compensation, and he would get back to the House as soon as possible&mdash;get back to me, in fact, in the House as soon as possible. I have not heard from him. There is nothing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> to say that he has done a thing about it. He just let that one go through to the keeper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the obligation of the Commonwealth and of this minister in terms of the compensation to the families of those people who perished in that particular crash? What is going to happen? The rule book says that, if you do not fly an aircraft within the requirements of the Australian Civil Aviation Authority, there is no insurance available; there is no compensation available. So who do the victims' families sue? Do they go Seaview, do they go the government, or do they just miss out altogether? This minister has failed to come into this place and actually state what will happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you go back over these past few weeks, you see that everything this minister touches becomes an absolute debacle. Whether it be ANL, the industrial relations policy or, importantly, other parts of his portfolio, this minister is a disaster and deserves to go. We hear the trumpeting from the other side about his enormous success in getting the privatisation of airports through the ALP conference. Two months ago he was running around the place bleating how the government was going to sell off individual airports. What did we get? From outright sale of the airports, we dropped back to a lease arrangement over 99 years. This is probably acceptable under the circumstances but, at the end of the day, this minister completely stuffed it up. What did we get? We got a lease arrangement over 50 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do you really think that that move by this minister will allow the proper development of Australian airports? Do you really think that we will get maximum investment into our airport infrastructure while this bloke is in charge? Do you really think, with the advances that are being made in aviation technology, that 20 or 30 years down the track, when this technology comes to pass, those who are tied up with the airports under this crazy lease arrangement will put any more money into it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Have a look at what this minister is doing to the Federal Airports Corporation at the moment. Once again, we have another instrumentality alongside the CAA, the Federal Airports Corporation, that is in a state of flux, the morale of its employees is shot to pieces, and within just a couple of days four of its most senior management people have walked out because there is no future in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The manager of commercial development&mdash;gone. The national aero-debtors controller has gone. The chief systems analyst has gone. The manager of corporate information has gone. They had no confidence in the future of the Federal Airports Corporation, the chief executive officer of which is now flying around Australia talking to the other staff saying, `Please fellas, hang on; don't go, we can't afford to lose your expertise.' I think that Mr Swingler probably realises from the way this minister is carrying on about this issue that he has got another Civil Aviation Authority problem on his hands within the FAC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happens with the FAC in terms of its financing? It is only a matter of a few weeks ago when it was going out into the market talking about loans of $100 million. That has been put on the backburner because it knows that, under the present circumstances, it is not going to be able to raise that sort of finance. So it is now doing its financial arrangements on a month to month basis. That is not the way to run an operation like that. </PARA>

We have had all the trumpeting about Badgerys Creek and the requirement that it is going to put onto the FAC in terms of fundraising, and the absolute requirement of having Badgerys Creek in place by the year 2000 for the games. Do you really think that the FAC, under these circumstances, has the capacity to go out there in the marketplace and raise this sort of money? Of course it does not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that the minister is looking after at the moment, which is allied to the CAA, is the TAAATS system&mdash;the Australian advanced air traffic system. Nobody knows what is happening there. The contract has been relet. There are people running around, allegedly trying to devise this system, but there is no reporting to this place. If you asked the minister what the TAAATS system was, he probably would not know. But we are told by him that he is completely on top of this arrangement and that we really have nothing to worry about. I think we do have something to worry about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point I would like to raise in terms of his competence is his competence to answer questions in this place. On 6 June this year, I asked him a question about the kerosene pond at Kingsford Smith airport. I would have thought that because the Kingsford Smith airport is bang in the middle of his electorate of Kingsford-Smith, this matter would have been of some concern. I asked him whether or not there was responsibility&mdash;a statutory obligation, in fact&mdash;to protect the environment from the effect of aircraft operations. I asked him what level of contamination of kerosene there was underneath Sydney airport; whether any action was being taken and, if so, what action at what cost; and what dangers were posed by the pollution of the pond to residents of the electoral division of Kingsford-Smith. Have we got an answer? None whatsoever. The reality is that he knows that I know what the answer is to that. It is an absolute disgrace. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although you would not appreciate it from the contribution made by members opposite, the subject matter of the MPI today refers to concern over the government's alleged maladministration of transport matters in the aviation industry and refers to a crisis of confidence. Most of that is being put home to the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton). Let me deal with the allegations and assertions of maladministration first, and I will come to the crisis of confidence second.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If members opposite are to suggest that the minister has somehow fallen foul of maladministration, they need to build the case. There has been no forensic examination on the part of those opposite, because a forensic examination of the facts will show that their assertions are baseless and do not stand up to any reasonable analysis whatsoever. The member for Hume (Mr Sharp) in particular has the gall to come into this House and make the assertions that he did. I will refer to some of the conduct on his part shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me look at the defence of the Minister for Transport before I come to the facts and the chronology. That defence was given appropriately yesterday in question time when the minister said, as quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have nothing to fear in this matter whatsoever because at every point, at every turn, when information has come into my hands I have acted promptly, speedily and effectively to refer it to the appropriate authorities. If anyone has withheld information or failed to act on matters within their knowledge, it is certainly not me.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the key point. Whenever information has come to the hands of the minister, he has responded quickly, effectively and appropriately. He repeated this in a different form on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> last night where, in response to a question from Paul Lyneham, he had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . my handling of the Civil Aviation Authority is subject to scrutiny every day. It has been for all the time I've had responsibility for it but I'm able to point out that every time serious information has been put before us or any matters of concern, they've been referred to the appropriate authorities for investigation. That will continue to be the case.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us have a look at the starting point for this matter. The starting point that those opposite assert is the speech made by the member for Hume in May this year. Let us look at the chronology and let us look at the facts. On 3 May the member for Hume makes a speech in the parliament. On 4 May, the following day, he repeats some of those allegations and assertions on radio. The next day, 5 May, he receives a letter from the CAA asking him to provide details of those matters. The letter from the CAA to the member for Hume has this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You indicated in the AM programme that you can substantiate everything you have claimed and that you have "got all the documentation that can back these claims up" plus "interviews with people directly involved".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your early response would be appreciated.</PARA>
<PARA>On 6 June, some 31 clear days later, there is a reply from the member for Hume, the shadow minister for transport, to the CAA, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter requesting copies of material to which I referred in the Parliament during debates involving the subject of the Monarch Air crash . . . and other issues concerning the CAA.</PARA>
<PARA>It further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have already had discussions with the Minister for Transport and have detailed to him my concerns. I communicated to him my wish for a Parliamentary inquiry into the issues that have arisen, including those regarding the Civil Aviation Authority. My discussions with the Minister are continuing and under those circumstances&mdash;and especially in view of the fact that the Civil Aviation Authority is the subject of complaints by my informants in the first place&mdash;I do not regard it appropriate that I should accede to your request.</PARA>
<PARA>What is he saying? He is saying, `I am not going to respond to any request from any authority for information; I am happy with the conversation that I am having with the Minister for Transport.' In response to that letter, the CAA wrote to the member for Hume on 17 June suggesting that, if he was worried about confidentiality, then information could be put to BASI, through the air safety CAIR system, where confidentiality would be at a premium. The member for Hume replied on 4 July, some 16 clear days later. In response to that letter from the CAA he states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the Monarch crash I have taken a close interest in that event and in the process have of course developed a close interest in and knowledge of the Civil Aviation Authority itself.</PARA>
<PARA>He later goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My concern regarding the issue and my motivation are driven by a genuine desire to see a safer aviation industry for the travelling public.</PARA>
<PARA>The next relevant fact in the sequence of these events is on 20 July when the minister, in response to the BASI report on the Monarch Air crash, announces a series of measures to improve safety matters. They were detailed by the minister, at the first opportunity after the Seaview Air crash on 2 October, in this House on 10 October. The minister referred to some of them. They range through about eight measures, culminating with the parliamentary inquiry. What was the response of the shadow minister to that? On 20 July, the same day, he whacked out a press release saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">John Sharp, Federal Member for Hume and Shadow Minister for Transport, has welcomed Transport Minister Laurie Brereton's announcement of a major shake-up of the Civil Aviation Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Sharp said that the measures announced by Mr Brereton were in accord with those Mr Sharp had called for in his speeches to Parliament on 3 May and 9 June 1994. In particular, he welcomed the establishment of the House of Representatives inquiry. Mr Sharp said that the Minister's response to the BASI Report is confirmation that the CAA cannot be left to put its own house in order but must be subject to vigorous reform.</PARA>
<PARA>So on 20 July, the member for Hume is entirely happy. The minister has done everything that he wanted him to. On 21 July, the following day, the shadow minister calls to see the minister at his office in Sydney. The minister kept a file note, which he has tabled in the House and which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On Thursday 21st July 1994 John Sharp shadow minister for transport called at my office in Phillip Street at approximately 12.15 pm. He indicated that the purpose of his visit was to congratulate me on the government's response to the BASI report on the Monarch Air crash.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the course of a visit which lasted about ten minutes he remarked that he intended to seek membership of the House of Representatives standing committee on transport and be involved in the forthcoming inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He also indicated in passing that he had some serious information regarding impropriety against high level officials in the CAA . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I indicated to Mr Sharp that if he had any real evidence of impropriety and he brought it to my notice, I would arrange for it to be immediately investigated by the appropriate authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He did not respond to my offer other than to say he would think about his options and perhaps raise it in the parliamentary committee process.</PARA>
<PARA>So on 21 July, the member for Hume was entirely happy with the process that the minister had put in train in terms of the parliamentary inquiry, and he welcomed warmly the measures of improvements that the minister had announced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next incident in this sequence of events was the Seaview Air crash on 2 October. What has transpired since 2 October? A range of measures has been implemented by the Minister for Transport. There have been personnel changes at the CAA, Seaview has been grounded, the cabinet has announced its decision for a separate safety authority or directorate, and a federal police investigation and a judicial inquiry have been instigated. We have seen all these measures, in addition to the parliamentary inquiry and the warm welcome the other measures received from the member for Hume. In the space of 14 days the minister, as he suggested in the House this week, has responded effectively, quickly and appropriately to every matter that has been put to him in the course of the series of events since the crash on 2 October. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why the sudden change of heart? The minister put his finger on it: those opposite think they can now score some grubby political points. I said I would make a point about the conduct of the shadow minister, the member for Hume. It took the shadow minister 48 clear days to let the CAA know that he would not provide it with any information, and it has taken the minister 14 days to ensure that every step in the process has been carried out. We have gone, appropriately and effectively, from an investigation of the crash to a judicial inquiry. Why do we now have this grubby politicking in this House? We have seen the sleaze merchants of the opposition in the Senate, and they now descend to personal abuse in this House. Their allegations of maladministration by the minister have been debunked effectively by a reasonable analysis of the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the crisis in confidence the MPI refers to? We know that the real crisis of confidence is in those opposite. The Newspoll in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 11 October showed that the Leader of the Opposition's satisfaction rating was 22; dissatisfied, 63&mdash;so he has a negative rating of 41. There is the crisis of confidence! The poll also showed the results for preferred Prime Minister: Keating, 51; Downer, 23. The Prime Minister is ahead 28 points. There is the crisis of confidence!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> stated `The Liberals: apocalypse when?' A headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> of 8 October, in the great memorial edition, was, `Menzies' people'. It was a special edition and had a picture of little Alexander Downer tipping the birthday cake off the table while the former leader, Dr Hewson, with his cup of bitterness, sat at the table. That is where the crisis of confidence is. The member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) raised an MPI on this same subject last week. He gets an honourable mention as well. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS>, one of the member for Bennelong's colleagues, Chris Puplick, a former Liberal senator, said in reference to him:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But his ideas were tossed like a dead cat on the table, causing people to panic and scream&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>The contribution of those opposite today does not cause us to panic and scream, unlike the member for Bennelong. There is no basis to this MPI. There is no basis to the assertion that the minister has done anything other than to conduct himself with complete propriety and appropriate ministerial conduct. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I make no apology for keeping the Chief Government Whip or the speakers on their toes and explaining to those present in the chamber exactly what the government is about. I have had the opportunity to read the lengthy daily program on the matter. The opposition is not opposed to the measures taken by the chief whip. The House is in fact considering eight pieces of legislation concurrently in relation to the Uruguay Round GATT outcome. It is a cognate debate agreed to by the coalition. As I said at the outset, we are supportive of this legislation but will be moving second reading amendments to the anti-dumping and dairy specific measures. We will also be reserving our right in respect of aspects of some of this legislation as it is dealt with in the due processes of the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the question time interruption, I was saying that there is no such thing as a level playing field and that there were clearly a number of nations which were less than willing to sign off on the Uruguay Round. Against this background, we cannot be complacent. I do not think that we can sit back and say that is that as far as the round is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Current global estimates for agriculture are very optimistic on the trading front, and clearly there will be benefits for Australia across a range of initiatives arising from the Uruguay Round. I welcome the decision by Japan to remove the bans on the import of rice. I vividly recall carrying Riverina rice to Japan on two separate occasions to make the point that their statutory embargo was one which Australia found extremely unacceptable in all the circumstances. So Japan has agreed to a tariffication proposal with regard to the import of Australian rice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also welcome the cooperation of His Excellency the Japanese Ambassador, here in Australia in relation to these matters, and point out that we want to see that process extended through to resolve the final protocols whereby Australian rice can be sold as processed value added rice and not just added into the overall imports into Japan and blended with other local rice and rice from other parts of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian rice is a top quality product. It is a product grown in part in my electorate, processed in the electorate of the member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) and also in the electorate of the member for Riverina (Mr Hicks). It is one of the true success stories of value adding. It is an industry that has been value adding for many years, and is now enjoying the extra benefit flowing from access to the Japanese market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also welcome a similar decision made by South Korea. I understand that these were difficult decisions for the Japanese and South Korean governments to make; nevertheless, they were decisions that had to be made given the advantages those two countries receive from international trade access by their exporters. This represents real progress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The removal of Canadian bans on our beef exports is also a welcome step. We are also looking at improved export opportunities in the areas of grain, coal, dairy products, manufactured food and the like. For the first time Australian cheese will be exported&mdash;I suspect it will come from milk from the cows in the electorates of Murray and Farrer which will then be processed by a number of very progressive co-ops and companies, although one of those companies has too large a board of directors. Eventually, for the first time, Australian cheese product will be sold directly to South Korea&mdash;again as part of the positive outcome of the Uruguay Round. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as opening up opportunities for Australian exporters, the round will also open up more jobs and, by doing so, contribute to Australia's overall wealth. But at the same time, I think there are grounds for caution. I welcome Senator McMullan's decision that the Cairns Group will continue to have a role to play in monitoring the progress of trade liberalisation in the agricultural sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the final outcome of the round was the provision that allows Europe and the United States to continue with existing subsidy arrangements on grain stockpiles. In other words, the EEP will continue for US wheat exports until the stockpile has been used. What we were not told was what the volume of the US and the European stockpiles is. Stockpiles notwithstanding, we are now aware that the US is looking to replace the EEP, and the sooner it does that the better. But I am also conscious that next year we will see a new farm bill before the US Congress and it remains to be seen what the final outcome of that will be. The US is also looking to replace the dairy export incentive program with market development programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In essence, the EEP is unacceptable to Australia. I and my colleagues in the National Party, and indeed members on both side of the House, have argued that case for a long time. Equally unacceptable are the plans of the European Union to stagger its commitment to agricultural reform, rather than on 1 January 1995 bringing forward all of its commitments and getting serious about the reductions in tariffs which are embraced by the Uruguay Round. We have no guarantees that either the US or the EC will implement all of their commitments flowing from the agreement and commencing from 1 January 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During a recent visit to Australia, Peter Sutherland warned of the effect that the failure of the US or Europe to implement their GATT agreements would have on other countries. Those ramifications are enormous. It must be of some concern that, of the 122 countries that are signatories to the round, only a handful have passed or are in the process of passing and implementing the GATT legislation. Not only is that of concern to me, but I note that the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) has expressed concerns that the implementing legislation in the US and Europe might be delayed beyond 1 January. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an extraordinarily tight legislative schedule given the fact that the US House of Representatives in its entirety and one-third of the US Senate is up for election in the first week of November&mdash;in just three weeks time. Where does this leave Australia? What happens if Senator Hollings in the US decides that the legislation is not right or if the composition of the US Congress, following the November elections, is not as sympathetic to GATT as the present congressional composition, if indeed it can be said that there is a willingness by the US to remove protectionist barriers that have been a blight on its trading relations for many decades. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The US has given undertakings that the implementing legislation will be passed before the January deadline, but what guarantees are there that this will actually happen. Of course, there are none and none can be given, given the circumstances facing the US Congress, which is currently in recess until the lame duck session which has been commissioned for late November. Likewise, what guarantees have we got that legislation is proceeding through European parliaments? Again none. Whilst the US is grappling with possible outcomes over a hung committee and elections, the Europeans have not yet decided who has the authority to proceed with the implementation and further negotiation of trade policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue is one akin to motherhood. Everybody acknowledges that it is a good thing to move down the path of fair trade liberalisation, but the tardiness of acquiescence suggests that there are serious reservations which will damage world trade and take away from the spirit and actuality of the Uruguay agreement. We in Australia recognise that the days of closed economies are well and truly over. Australia needs  exports to grow. Our domestic economy is small in comparison to those of the surrounding region, Europe and elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The prospect that we can go back to Fortress Australia with 150 and 200 per cent tariff walls is not in our interests. That needs to be stated from time to time as one of the parties in the Senate seeks to drum up the protectionist argument in extremis once again. We have no choice but to cut our path on the unlevel international playing field, but to do that sensibly, effectively and with some very smart trading strategies which are required to bring this about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For too long there has been a stigma attaching to a former leader of the National Party and former member for Murray, John McEwen, on this question of protection. It needs to be said that John McEwen took the first two big steps along the trade liberalisation path in the 1950s and 1960s. Firstly, in 1957, against bitter opposition from the RSL, he pushed ahead with a fundamental trade treaty between Australia and Japan. That has done much to underpin the economic growth of Australia ever since. Secondly, he moved from the quota system, which was so dominant in the 1950s and 1960s, to a tariffication system. Most honourable members would realise that that was the correct step to take in those circumstances. It is unfair and unjust to say that John McEwen was of the school which favoured total Fortress Australia protection. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He tariffied many quotas, which was a liberalising move. As the member for Murray adds, he was also responsible for some of the very early trade initiatives between Australia and New Zealand which were then carried on in a more direct sense by Doug Anthony, another former leader of the National Party. Doug Anthony introduced the closer economic relations proposals which the current government, to its credit, has maintained and added to. This has led to a form of seamless CER between our two countries. I fully support that initiative because it benefits both Australia and New Zealand. It took particular courage to introduce those proposals given the cost it represented to the dairy industry, especially in south-east Australia, in the initial phases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The record of the National Party and indeed the previous coalition governments ought to be more fairly examined by those who want to go into the history of our trade policy and development, because there is much that this side of the House can be and should be proud of. As part of that vision, I add that we cannot stand still. The sooner we sort out some of the remaining lines of difficulty that exist between Australia and New Zealand the better. For example, there is no reason why, with the inevitable further progression of the seamless CER, there cannot be domestic to domestic aviation flights operating from Canberra to Christchurch, Canberra to Wellington and Canberra to Auckland. That would provide an added airfreight capacity. It would also enhance the linking of our two great tourist industries. That is a logical step. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I advocate seamless CER. I advocate as a priority, as we address this important trade legislation, that seamless CER provide domestic to domestic aviation at the level of point of entry scrutiny which would fall between the requirements of international inbound flights versus domestic only. I think the problems which are there can be ironed out in a systematic way which will not in any way compromise our Customs, New Zealand's Customs or other requirements but which will provide a streamlined seamless approach on that one matter of aviation, quite apart from other matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that in the whole approach to GATT some businesses will experience a degree of discomfort. Some industries, such as the tobacco, citrus and dairy industries, are up the sharp end, if you like. They necessitate additional responses from the federal government as part of its approach. In saying that, I do not subscribe to the proposition that GATT is bad. The coalition is not opposed to this legislation, but I foreshadow that, at the appropriate stage in both houses, the amendments which I referred to earlier will be moved by my colleagues with specific responsibilities relating to the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are yet to hear the detail of the government's response to the citrus industry developments and its plans to allow it to handle them. This legislation is a net negative in a very sharp way as a result of the application of the GATT decision on sales tax applying to the citrus industry. I know the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), the member for Riverina, the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) and others have been very much on the front foot in representing the special circumstances faced by the citrus industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of meetings this week and the debate to happen later today on the Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill, there are three cornerstones for which we will go into fight for the citrus industry: firstly, a better system of labelling than is proposed by this government to protect the integrity of `made in Australia' in line with requests lodged by the citrus industry; secondly, a sensible provision which will be detailed by others in this debate with regard to taxation arrangements and the citrus industry; and, thirdly, to look at every aspect, in light of the government's response to the citrus industry, of the options that might then pertain to the Senate's consideration of this aspect of the cognate bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that this legislation, in a narrowcast sense, confers a slight gain on the tobacco industry. But it is also true that elsewhere it has been recommended that the mixing legislation and system pertaining to the tobacco industry be dramatically altered. The tariff structure is about to be dramatically altered. The tobacco industry is facing a very difficult time as around the world and here in Australia attitudes to health and customs are such that tobacco consumption is falling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst ever tobacco is legal in Australia&mdash;and it is a legal commodity&mdash;then I believe the Australian tobacco growers have a right to a fair go in their production of Australian tobacco leaf, providing Australian tobacco industry jobs. It is in this context that we await the government's further response on the tobacco industry&mdash;the detailed package which is still in the pipeline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of concerns that this legislation will let go, although with a deferred timetable in case agreement is not reached elsewhere, a scheme which assists the Australian dairy industry. It does not involve taxpayers' funds, but it is planned to sunset it out in the year 2000. I say in clear-cut terms that we are concerned that we are entering, through this legislation, the first stage without seeing exactly what the government's replacement legislation will be. The Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney), in introducing this legislation, and Minister McMullan elsewhere have guaranteed that in the autumn sitting we will see replacement legislation with special dairy industry arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am still concerned about that assurance because, for one, the New Zealand Minister for Agriculture and Forestry, John Fallon, has been in this country making very clear New Zealand's concerns about some of the options and proposals being looked at between now and the year 2000 as replacement measures following the passage of this legislation. For another, there seems to be some real debate as to what is the best way to go and what, at the end of the day, will be GATT-legal. I do know that, underpinning this approach to the legislation, there is a need to change the culture on bilateral negotiations and the administration of some of this legislation, particularly anti-dumping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have in the past given too much away in our bilateral negotiations, in situations where we did not have to be purer than pure, where we did not have to be right up the sharp end, and some in the negotiations between some of our key trading partners. I very much regret that a succession of ministers in quick shuffle under the Labor government has allowed a bureaucratic circumstance to arise where too much has been conceded too soon as part of that whole negotiating process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is essential that the Australian government, its negotiators and bureaucrats with responsibility for those negotiations take sensibly tough stands. I repeat that there is no such thing as a level playing field and there is no reason why Australia should jeopardise Australian jobs and make concessions ahead of the game. At the end of the day, we support the Uruguay Round, we support the eventual outcome, and we want to see the colour of the money of the other 121 countries participating. Too often we have taken the first step along this rocky road over the last few years, particularly in respect of the citrus industry, while other countries have been very slow off the mark, thus leaving Australia exposed in that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As one of my colleagues correctly remarked today, it was not perhaps so much the exactitude of the anti-dumping legislation which has caused problems but the culture of the administrators of anti-dumping in this country which has allowed for a great tightening up of the ability of Australian companies to successfully mount anti-dumping measures where they are being dumped against. I do not believe that anti-dumping measures should be a form of backdoor protection, but I do believe that anti-dumping legislation should be administered fairly, efficiently and effectively. Too often, the culture has been to concede the point to the country which was dumping on Australia in respect of the particular industry involved. Not often enough did we systematically examine all aspects of it before reaching that conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are a sovereign nation. It is a damn tough trading world out there. There is little going for Australia with its long freight distances, albeit with its tremendous natural resources. In those circumstances we need to maximise the odds where we properly can without cutting across the detail and thrust of GATT in the broad and the Uruguay Round specific outcome. It is for these reasons that I indicate the coalition's support for the eight bills before the House, with some reservations to be pursued in the Senate and elsewhere in the form of amendments to three of the bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to comment on one of the bills that is part of the package of cognate bills before the House at present&mdash;the Trade Marks Bill 1994. While the opposition is not opposing the bill, there are a couple of points which ought to be made that have been raised with me by people who practice in this area. Because of that, I have been moved to make these few comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point to make in respect of the Trade Marks Bill 1994, being debated as part of this legislative package, is that in 1989 the then Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), authorised the Registrar of Trade Marks to set up a working party to review existing trade marks legislation. That working party was chaired by the Registrar of Trade Marks and initially included two officers from the Trade Marks Office, two persons nominated by the Law Council, and two persons nominated by the Institute of Patent Attorneys of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In July 1991, that working party produced a discussion paper, which was released by the then Minister for Science and Technology. The minister invited public comment by 31 December 1991. A number of submissions were received and those submissions were considered by the working party, which reported to the minister in July 1992. The working party's report proposed the repeal of the Trade Marks Act 1955 and its replacement with a new act, incorporating several major changes. Although there was consensus within the working party on the majority of its recommendations, there were a small number of important issues on which the views of the Trade Marks Office representatives differed from those of the private sector representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a media release announcing the publication of the working party's report, the minister invited comments from interested parties up to 31 January 1993. However, on 22 September 1992, more than four months before the proposed end date for submissions, the minister issued a further release stating that the government would not await public comment but would proceed to draw new legislation forthwith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister indicated that the new legislation would follow the recommendations of the working party except in the areas where there had been disagreement between the representatives of the Trade Marks Office and the private sector representatives. In those areas the legislation would follow the recommendations of the Trade Marks Office representatives&mdash;the minority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year, the minister released an exposure draft of the proposed Trade Marks Bill. On the cover of the exposure draft it was said that the bill was in draft form and was not finally settled and that `one of the purposes in releasing it is to test it for errors and omissions'. The working party had no involvement in drafting the bill and, although the members of the working party received a copy of the legislation prior to its release, there was no time to correct even the most obvious errors. I am advised that there exists a number of drafting errors in the bill which may lead to consequences of a nature unintended by the working party. Moreover, I believe, concern has been expressed about the proposal to amalgamate the present parts A and B of the trade mark register into a single register and about the proposal to cease recording associated trade marks on the register. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that neither of these changes are required in order for Australia to comply with the obligations under the TRIPS agreement of the World Trade Organisation. While the changes may result in some simplification of existing trade marks arrangements, I am aware that there is concern in some sections that the quality of Australian registrations may be adversely affected by the changes. Consequently, the prospect of a trade mark registration being upheld in court may be diminished. This in turn would reduce the value of trade mark registration to the proprietor since the cost of enforcement would be substantially increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 27 July, the current Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, Senator Schacht, issued a statement stating that the government now intended to enact the Trade Marks Bill 1994 in its current form and not await comments on the exposure draft. Although the minister has said that the decision to enact the current Trade Marks Bill does not detract from the importance of the process of consultation involved with the release of the exposure draft, I am concerned that, once the bill has been enacted in its current form, it is most unlikely that any new changes of substance will be contemplated by the government. While the minister has publicly committed himself to introducing a new amending bill taking into account the outcomes of the public consultation process early in the autumn 1995 sittings, I would not be optimistic that this serious commitment would be met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the opposition supports the current bill and endorses the implementation of the arrangements that comply with our international obligations relating to the establishment of the World Trade Organisation, I urge the minister to be genuine in his sentiment to take account of the views of the interested parties. </PARA>

As I do so, I say that I am disappointed not only at the lack of participation from government members but also at, particularly, the absence of government members on the speakers' list for what I would have considered a very important piece of legislation affecting a number of aspects of Australian life, particularly Australian rural life. Without in any sense reflecting on the ability of a deputy speaker to participate in this debate on behalf of the government, I am more than a little alarmed that Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins is the only person listed to speak in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before participating any further in the debate, I declare that I have a vested interest in the outcome of the debate. I am now, albeit in a small way, a citrus grower. Clearly, much of what happens with this legislation directly affects the Australian citrus industry. I am certain that there are members of the Australian Labor Party in this House who, while they may not be citrus growers, represent a substantial number of citrus growers, particularly in New South Wales. I recognise that it is difficult for the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) to participate in the debate. He represents a number of growers and I know he is conscious of their concerns. I would have expected to hear from the honourable member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) about the concerns citrus growers in her electorate will be raising. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the interjection. I am not claiming that this has been a particularly unique debate, but I am saying that the opposition as a team has shown remarkable harmony and sense of purpose for which I would have thought the government would have been grateful&mdash;I am not suggesting that the parliamentary secretary is not grateful&mdash;given the short-term mileage that could have been made out of misrepresenting the GATT arrangement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that opposition members of both the Liberal and National parties know that, if they were in government, they would be having to pursue a course much the same as the government is pursuing in relation to the GATT reforms of the Uruguay Round, if we were to be responsibly governing for the nation. That is not to say that we in opposition believe that all that has happened in the Uruguay Round has been ideal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the National Party has already indicated a number of the concerns the opposition has had about trade-offs that have been made on behalf of Australian industries. We have felt that trade-offs have been made much too rapidly. This evening I represent an industry which feels that a number of trade-offs have been made much too rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate, the whole concept of a level playing field is treated with scorn and derision, in spite of the best efforts of the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) and me to point out to people the advantages of the so-called level playing field. No-one in the government, as far as I know, and no-one in the opposition pretends that we will ever have such a thing as a level playing field, but the reality is that, thanks to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the Uruguay Round, and the inclusion of agriculture in that round, the playing field is now likely to be more level than it was. One needs only to look at the sorts of changes that have occurred in, for example, the citrus industry to appreciate the level of levelling that has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will illustrate what the result of the Uruguay Round does for my orange growers as they attempt to get into export markets. For example, in the area of placing whole fruit in cartons and trying to get into Japan, we now have a situation of non-tariff barriers being expressed under the Uruguay Round as tariff barriers. The obligation the Japanese have accepted is to lower their tariff barriers by 40 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The obligation the Koreans have accepted is to lower their tariff barriers by 49 per cent for imported oranges. The long-term obligation the Singaporeans have accepted is to lower their tariff barriers by 63 per cent. That is good news for exporters of whole fruit into those markets. While the figures are not as dramatic, it is good news for exporters of whole fruit into almost all of the markets of our competitors who are signatories to the GATT round. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate, the popular perception is that, as Australians, we have given too much away. While the figures I have given to the parliament are available on a chart, the figures that are running in the media in my electorate point out to Australian citrus growers that, under the GATT round, the protection rate they can expect in the future will be five per cent, while the United States will continue with a protection rate of 40 per cent and Brazil with a protection rate of 35 per cent. The fact that Brazil has decreased its protection rate from 105 per cent to 35 per cent is largely ignored. Australian growers are painfully aware that their level of protection will sit on five per cent while that of Brazilian growers will be 35 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My own view, and the view of the opposition, has been that GATT has a great deal to commend it and deserves to be defended. But the perception in the community is that there are still people, particularly in labour intensive industries, who see GATT as failing to deliver precisely what they sought to deliver. The citrus industry sees itself as being a sacrificial lamb and thinks it is being dismissed in favour of other industries that, in its view and in the eyes of the government, can afford to be ignored because the major players&mdash;the beef, dairy and grains industries&mdash;are seen to be winners under the GATT arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The citrus industry feels that too much has been given away. As we deal with this citrus industry package today, I think the government has a responsibility to offer the citrus industry some sort of reassurance that it wants the industry to remain. The government should recognise, as it did with the sugar industry, the difficulty the citrus industry faces under the GATT agreement and the opportunity it has to be a contributor to Australian exports if it is given the chance to restructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to popular opinion, the Australian citrus  industry is an efficient primary producer. I know the industry well. Australian citrus growers, growing whole fruit in a largely mediterranean climate with the benefit of irrigation, produce a product of which the nation can be proud and at a price that can take on the rest of the world. The citrus industry does not seek protection for whole fruit. While it does not like the tariff barriers it still has to face in Korea, Japan, Singapore and other major export markets, it has been prepared to take them on because it is efficient by world standards. Putting delectable whole fruit in cartons and making it available to the rest of the world has been a success story for the citrus industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty of the citrus industry has arisen only in the area of producing juice fruit. The problem it faces, in common with all other citrus producing countries around the world, is that the Brazilians dominate the world juice market. I do not want to be uncharitable about Brazilian fruit, but I am told that it is relatively unattractive. It is grown effectively in tropical conditions with very little rainfall. It is not meant to be an attractive fruit to eat because there is no whole fruit market for it. The Brazilians specialise in the production of frozen orange juice concentrate. They do it better than anybody else in the world on a scale the rest of the world has scarcely dreamed possible. We cannot hope to compete with the Brazilians. The Australian citrus industry has to focus its attention away from producing juice to producing more whole fruit for export or local markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple reality is that over the last two decades the Australian citrus industry&mdash;in response to local consumer demand&mdash;has had what I will call a juice mentality. Twenty years ago, even the thought of having orange juice sitting in the fridge door was almost unknown. Today, orange juice in the fridge door is as common as milk in the fridge door. In response to consumer demand, the Australian citrus growers have tended to grow more and more fruit for juice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The grim reality is that the Brazilians have taken on Australian, Californian and Floridan growers and have outplayed them at their own game. Now, as GATT forces the barriers down, the opportunity for Australian citrus growers to compete becomes more difficult than ever. That is not to say that we should be dismissive of the Australian juice industry. But, as we encourage growers to produce more whole fruit for export markets, we have to be prepared to recognise that accumulating a good export packout&mdash;putting quality oranges into boxes for export and for the local market&mdash;inevitably means that there will be an overrun of fruit that will be destined for the juice market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The responsibility we face as a parliament, in encouraging the citrus industry to once again pick up the export challenge, which it is increasingly doing, is to ensure that the juice overrun still has a viable home, because the falling barriers under GATT have meant that Brazilian juice is more freely available, so it is more difficult for Australian growers to compete. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian industry has not been without its innovative practitioners. Some time ago, they got into the production of 100 per cent juice product and encouraged Australians to be the consumers of it. What happened? As Australian consumers became increasingly selective, they said, `We prefer 100 per cent juice product made from Australian oranges.' And over the last two years, the proportion of Australian oranges&mdash;instead of Brazilian or some other source of frozen orange juice concentrate&mdash;being used to make up the 100 per cent product has gone from 20 per cent to 60 per cent. It ought to be further encouraged because it gives Australian producers a great opportunity to find a home for that juice fruit. The labelling legislation, which is shortly to be dealt with, is a further opportunity for Australians to deliberately say, `Yes, I will take that product because the label indicates to me that it is Australian.' That consumer preference is, of course, always GATT-friendly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before the House, frankly, does not do anything to solve the Australian citrus industry problems; all it does is exacerbate them. But the opposition is not intending to frustrate the passage of this legislation at this point. To do so would only add further to the industry's confusion. Frankly, we need to use the Senate as a lever to ensure that the government recognises the obligations it ought to have to assist the citrus industry, either in the form of a sales tax package or through some restructuring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirty years ago, the Australian citrus industry was involved in an arrangement which ensured that, if a processor used 25 per cent Australian product in his fruit juice drink, he would be taxed at 11 per cent instead of 21 per cent. Because the obligation was to use Australian, Papua New Guinean, Fijian or New Zealand products, it was GATT-unfriendly. The legislation before the House simply removes the words `Australian', `Papua New Guinean', `Fijian', and `New Zealand' and inserts the words `any country' in order to be GATT-legal. So, through the passage of this legislation, it will be possible for processors effectively to take fruit juice from any country and, as long as they use 25 per cent of it in their fruit juice drink, they will be taxed at 11 per cent instead of the beverage rate of 21 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry has suggested that it would be a good idea for the government to introduce a package wherein all fruit juice of 100 per cent product, regardless of origin, has a zero tax rate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sherry's recommendation was that fruit juice should be treated as whole milk is treated. He believes that a 100 per cent fruit juice product should be seen as a food, just as white milk is seen as a food. Senator Sherry suggested that there should not be any difference between whether you squeezed it out of an orange or an udder&mdash;it ought to be tax free. The government faces the challenge of making that sort of tax amendment in order to ensure that the industry is encouraged to stay in the 100 per cent juice market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on the opposition expect some realistic compensation package to be handed down to the citrus industry. I am not critical of the fact that Senator Collins has not made that package available yet. There may well be good reason for the delay but, clearly, opposition members find themselves in a difficult position. We do not know whether we can support the government because we do not know whether what it is proposing for the citrus industry will be adequate to meet the needs of the industry as it endeavours once again to develop an export focused rather than a juicefocused structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I point out to the House that one of the extraordinary difficulties the citrus industry faces is that it has what are called long lead times. If you plant a citrus tree this month&mdash;which, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would recommend if you are anticipating any planting&mdash;you can expect to wait 10 years before it will be in economic production. That is quite a sobering thought if you are about to invest in a citrus orchard. If we are serious about encouraging growers out of the popular Valencia juice variety and into Murcot mandarins, early navels, late navels or some other even more popular marketing variety, we need to ensure that we recognise the cost that growers will bear in that restructuring exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are long lead times in the citrus industry. Right now, the government&mdash;not unreasonably&mdash;has introduced an arrangement where grape growers are deliberately encouraged to plant grapes because the planting cost of grapevines is a tax deduction. But the same tax deduction does not apply for horticulturists planting trees. So the message that the government is sending&mdash;I believe, unwittingly&mdash;to irrigation farmers across Australia is: get into the grape industry. I would be a shade wary. I think that the grape industry has a great future, but it would be grossly irresponsible for the government to continue to send a message to all irrigation operators that they should grow grapes instead of growing some form of tree fruit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The challenge the government faces is to recognise the same right of tax provisions for the citrus industry as it does for the grape industry. The challenge the opposition faces is to determine whether or not it can responsibly support the government's proposals when it does not know what those proposals will be. We are waiting for an indication from the government of the sort of compensation package&mdash;whether in the form of sales tax, juice promotion, export promotion or rationalisation of packing sheds, or as part of the labelling legislation&mdash;it proposes for this key horticultural industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian citrus industry, efficient as it is&mdash;able to put whole fruit in cartons and compete with the rest of the world, as it does&mdash;cannot take on the Brazilian giants alone. Total Australian production is little over one per cent of the total world production. Frankly, the challenge the government faces is to keep in place this key horticultural industry with enormous export potential with exactly the same enthusiasm it has shown for the sugar industry and, as the Leader of the National Party said, as it will be called to show as it rationalises the tobacco industry. The opposition, with a number of concerns, is supportive of this legislation, but the government must complete its package of reforms for the citrus industry before it can expect the opposition to show support for this legislation in the other chamber. </PARA>

In doing so, I want to pick up some of the remarks of the honourable member for Wakefield, who has criticised the attitude of the Australian Democrats and others from both chambers who have taken, as he correctly described, the populist view of protectionism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I first arrived here, I perhaps found those notions rather attractive. On the surface, and after only a simplistic analysis, they are attractive. But, after analysis and in the context of representing people in my electorate who have been, I think I can say, savagely affected by tariff reductions in relation to their gaining employment and remaining in employment, I have to say that I now have an understanding of the importance of the types of measures that the final round of GATT arrived at and that this legislation tries to put in place. Often loosely it is said that we are attempting to achieve free trade, but that perhaps misses the point. All producers&mdash;whether it be the citrus producers, whom the honourable member for Wakefield spoke about, or the wheat and rice producers, whom the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) spoke about&mdash;want the ability to trade fairly throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Having come to those conclusions, one of the important things we need to remember is that many of the actions we have taken to this point have perhaps been on a unilateral basis. There has been the inherent risk in taking those actions ourselves and being seen to support that form of fair trade, pure trade without others in the global community doing likewise. To check whether the conclusion I arrived at was ideologically sound, honourable members would understand that a reference I went to was the book of the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) and John Quiggin, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Work for All</EMPHASIS>. I am happy to now quote from that book. On page 180, the honourable member and Mr Quiggin say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . completion of the GATT Uruguay round should put an end to the creeping protectionism which is spreading across the industrialised world, and leads to progressive opening up of major markets. Restrictions on the flow of goods through tariff and non-tariff barriers cost developing countries, for example, about as much as the total amount of development assistance they receive each year&mdash;about US$50 billion. It seems likely that a steady global reduction in protection will increase global employment.</PARA>
<PARA>I think we would all agree that that is the outcome we hope would be achieved through the cooperative involvement of all the parties involved in the Uruguay Round. I hope that many manufacturers who might see the advantages that they have in being in Australia will take up the challenges that have been put to them by this government in developing export markets and in developing import replacement sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not often reach for the analyses of bodies such as the Industry Commission or ABARE to support any arguments, but the analysis that the Industry Commission has made of the effect of the final outcome of the Uruguay Round indicates that there is great potential for Australia as a nation to improve its trading position. The Leader of the National Party mentioned his concerns about the tardiness with which some of the major trading nations might be implementing the necessary legislation that is involved here that we are implementing. I agree that we need to see honest efforts by all the signatories, especially the major trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate has highlighted not only some of the agricultural products that have been mentioned but also some of the products in the service sector. These include the types of changes that we are seeing, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. This should be seen on the basis of one in, all in. I hope we see the type of cooperation which will have a dramatic effect for Australia not only as a trading nation but also globally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to speak particularly about the Patents (World Trade Organization) Amendments Bill. I read the press release of the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht) late last month, and the particular item that caught my attention was those measures that affected the pharmaceutical industry. I think the pharmaceutical industry is one of the great success stories of Australia. It is one of the great success stories of the government's involvement in a form of sectoral policy. I am not ashamed to say that I wholeheartedly originally supported, and still support, the factor F scheme, which has had a dramatic effect and has been very important. I see the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) nodding his head. I think his part of the urban fringe of Melbourne might be a beneficiary of the establishment of some manufacturers in that area. Somehow we have to encourage some of the players to get out to the suburbs on the northern fringe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing was that the Australian government had a key role to play, especially in regard to the pharmaceutical industry, not only because of industry policy but also because of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. One of the tricks for government was to be able to match up the intentions of those two schemes and get desired outcomes. One of the features of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme was that we have been able to cap the price to government of the particular items that are listed. Often the manufacturers have said that we do so unfairly. So we had to look creatively at the way that government could assist manufacturers to expand their industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of that occurs through the pricing mechanism, but part of it occurs through the realisation that, in the patenting provisions for pharmaceuticals, there is a need to look at the particular problems and difficulties that manufacturers have in placing items out in the market. They relate to being able to get the different pharmaceuticals listed. Therefore, the type of testing required to achieve a patent is only part of the story. A whole host of further testing must go on to adjudge the  buyer equivalents, the safety and the suitability of those pharmaceuticals. This, of course, takes time. At the time of the institution of factor F, it took greater time than it does at the moment because considerable efficiencies were gained out of the features that arose from the Baume inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the carrots held out to manufacturers under the 16-year life of patents was to give an additional four-year patent. Coincidentally, that now brings those arrangements to the 20-year extension that we will see arising out of the piece of legislation which is among the group of bills that we are talking about today. In that context I was pleased to see that the minister confirmed that, with patents on pharmaceuticals, we would still be discussing with industry the way in which we could achieve the effective 15-year term of patents, making allowance for those earlier years where manufacturers were unable to get product into the market because of the need for the testing to be carried out to get the pharmaceuticals listed on the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There are other features before us in relation to the patents bill. The four main features were covered by the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs in his second reading speech. There has been adequate provision to ensure that the transitional arrangements do not, in too harsh a way, penalise people that are developing a product. I think that has been covered by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Patents (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill is one of three bills that puts in place what is required of us under the so-called TRIPS agreement, the trade related aspects of intellectual property rights agreement, and covers those items in the patents, the copyright and the trade marks legislation. So there have been significant advances in the way we are looking at intellectual property rights protection. This will be important to those people in Australia who wish to trade with developing nations. There have been great difficulties in those nations because they have not, like others, protected intellectual property aspects of the development of product. I think that we will see great opportunities. Again, one of the sectors that will be greatly advantaged is pharmaceutical manufacturers because they are well placed, because of the health of their industry in Australia, to take advantage of the trading opportunities that arise as the aspects are progressively put in place in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The other issue that I want to raise is that, arising out of these discussions, we will see the starting up of the World Trade Organisation. I want to touch on some aspects that might be looked at by the World Trade Organisation. One issue is the various labour standards that we see throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst it is very tricky to talk about the freeing up and the lifting of protectionist measures in trade, I think we still have a responsibility to look at the standards, especially those under which goods are manufactured. Other standards we should look at besides labour standards are environmental standards that abound in different countries. These are costs to manufacture, but more importantly they are costs that we as a developed nation should have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week in an adjournment debate I took the opportunity to raise these issues, particularly the issue of child labour. I do not want to provoke the honourable member for La Trobe, but something that the ACTU has taken up is the question of child labour. One of the propositions that was put was that under the umbrella of GATT we should be looking at some of the social responsibilities of countries. I am not saying that taking social responsibilities under the umbrella of GATT, especially in the area of child labour, is the only thing we should be doing, but it is one of the avenues that we should perhaps be looking at. The other way, and something that the ILO has adopted, is to sit down with government, manufacturers and others to look at strategies to get around the need for children to make an economic contribution to families, which some say arises as a result of poverty, leading some countries not to take greater action on the question of child labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where there is goodwill, especially on the part of developed countries, to sit down and assist developing countries to try to tackle some of these social problems, there will be great advantage. Some countries have taken measures that might be interpreted as protectionist measures to try to achieve this aim. Minister McMullan has suggested that we have to be careful that we do not fall into the trap of propping up measures which, although they achieve worthwhile social outcomes, merely have a protectionist angle to them. I hope that the Australian government, through its continuing involvement with GATT and through the World Trade Organisation when it starts up hopefully very early next year, will continue to play a major role in the development of policies that get around some of the appalling labour practices and conditions that we see overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The test of these pieces of legislation will be our determination as a government to ensure that other governments do the right thing and play their role as partners in the opportunities that arise out of world trade. I think that that is what those who might have been described as opportunists will be looking for in the future. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We in Australia have certainly waited an awfully long time for the cognate bills on the world trade amendments. I am sure that many of us thought we would never see this legislation. GATT just seemed to keep on going. Out there in many of the country halls where I have attended meetings over the last 10 years, the subject of GATT was the one that always came to the minds of many farmers. They had another name for GATT. They called it the general agreement for talk and talk, because that seemed to be what was happening. It was a lot of talk and talk and not a lot of results.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last April the news which every Australian farmer and many processors and manufacturers had been waiting for finally came through. At that point we seemed to end that talk and talk and got a positive breakthrough in the GATT negotiations. I am sure all those free-thinking people certainly welcomed that announcement at that time. The real reductions in import restrictions, the new market opportunities and hope for Australian agricultural industries which had been buffeted by international tariffs, quotas and lockouts really opened up with that announcement in April of last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The resolution of GATT has the estimated potential to deliver $900 million a year to the Australian agricultural sector. It certainly offers magnificent opportunities for all industries in Australia. Only time will tell whether that estimated $900 million is delivered to our agricultural sector. It certainly gives us in Australia an opportunity, particular the efficient producers who have been given as a result of the GATT outcomes access to markets that were otherwise locked out of their reach, to build on our export potential and on the reputation of our Australian agricultural products as being clean, green and healthy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">GATT is only one dimension we have to address as a nation. We live in a global shopping village. Whilst we live in a global shopping village, other nations also live and shop in that global shopping village. We have to be prepared to go out there and compete with other exporting nations to gain a share of these markets which will be opened up as a result of GATT. A challenge offered to this government and any future government is to ensure that we get our cost of production down so that we can meet those markets and compete with those other countries. As I said, we live in a global shopping village. Whilst we shop in that global shopping village, so too do those importing countries which will be seeking products from around the world and from markets that we will be trying to gain particularly for our agricultural sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Dairy Produce (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill 1994 terminates the market support payments to the Australian dairy industry in order to comply with the GATT requirements. Currently, dairy farmers pay a levy on all milk which funds extra payment on export products. This initiative acts as an incentive to export. Rather than the producers or manufacturers competing and undercutting each other on a domestic market, through this process they have been encouraged to get out there, seek markets around the world and export. It has obviously worked extremely well because currently the dairy industry exports more than $1 billion annually in product. That is a great boost to our balance of trade figures, it is wealth that we create here in this nation, and it is jobs that are created in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme is being phased out. The proposal in the 1992 legislation was that it would be phased out by the year 2000. The legislation before the House means that the current scheme will be terminated, and a new scheme to continue the phase-out in a GATT-legal form will be introduced in the near future. We on this side of the House have a concern about that. We are terminating a current scheme with this legislation with the new GATT-legal legislation not yet being available. This has created enormous uncertainties here in Australia and in other dairy producing countries around the world&mdash;here we are, terminating legislation, yet we do not have the new legislation nor have we seen it. We on this side of the House do have concerns. Whilst we agree with the thrust of the World Trade Organisation amendment legislation, we would like to see the new legislation and the new arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been much speculation and concern about the possible inclusion of countries which export products to our domestic Australian market. It could easily be resolved by definitive action from the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dairy industry is Australia's largest food processing industry and consistently earns more than $1 billion in export income annually. The industry has opportunities to expand and its efficient members would love to expand, but they want certainty. Enormous investment in the dairy food processing industry is going on in Australia right now. Kraft Foods, for example, is investing $140 million in plant and equipment over the next three years; Bega Cooperative, which is located not far from where we are in Canberra, has allocated $12 million for capital expenditure over the next four years; and Bonlac is spending $6 million on plant rationalisation and upgrades. They are just three examples of dairy food processing companies which are investing capital in their industry. There are many more right across the country. Many more investors are placing their confidence in the Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the House are extremely surprised that the government has not encouraged&mdash;in fact, has not even considered encouraging&mdash;that confidence by its failure to bring forward that legislation. Terminating the current industry support scheme, without a GATT-legal version in place, clearly is not sending the right signals to the dairy industry, the potential investors and those other exporting nations around the world. The coalition recognises the uncertainty in the industry which this has created and will be moving an amendment. Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to move that amendment now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Nehl)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;I am afraid you cannot move it now; you can foreshadow it and at the appropriate time when going through the various bills you can move it. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YT4">Mr BRUCE SCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I foreshadow then that our amendment, as circulated in the House, will be moved in the consideration of the appropriate bill. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: "whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is gravely concerned that this legislation is being terminated ahead of the introduction of the GATT legal replacement legislation which will be needed to ensure confidence and investment is maintained in the Australian dairy industry".</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat: I am surprised that the government has failed to bring forward that legislation so that it can complement the current legislation which is before the House. If the dairy industry survives&mdash;and we know it will survive, but we would like it to survive with that confidence and we would like the government to give it that injection of confidence right now&mdash;its future is indeed bright. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">GATT will certainly open up markets in the United States, the European Union, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines and Mexico. Also, in the international market, much less subsidised produce will be competing with Australian produce. For instance, Australian cheese products will have access to an additional 3,000 tonnes on the United States market, bringing the quota to 7,000 tonnes. The Australian dairy industry has doubled its share of the world export market in the past 10 years. That is a clear example that our dairy industry is certainly prepared to go out there, find its markets and compete with the best in the world. The dairy industry is growing faster than any other major export industry in this nation. Growth prospects will be enhanced by the opportunities presented by the breakthrough and the GATT agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the horticultural industry. This industry is affected by the Sales Tax (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill. My electorate of Maranoa&mdash;which is often not thought of as a very big area of citrus industry&mdash;has, in the central highlands, the largest privately owned family orchard in the Southern Hemisphere. It has a quarter of a million trees on 800 hectares watered by that wonderful piece of infrastructure in Central Queensland, the Fairbairn Dam. The citrus season currently is seven months a year and, in that part of Queensland, it has the potential to increase to 11 months a year. During the citrus season, the orchard in Central Queensland, near Emerald, employs 160 pickers, 60 packers and has 30 permanent staff. This operation is a stirling example of the opportunities that exist for our citrus industry in world markets because that is what this investment is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1994 the entire crop of Ellendale mandarins went to Canada&mdash;the entire crop. Other varieties went to South-East Asian destinations. This operation will be keen to pursue the markets which GATT will open up. The citrus industry is one of the major parties to the Sales Tax (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill. Prior to the GATT round, a product containing 25 per cent or more by volume of Australian fruit juice had a sales tax rate of 11 per cent; with a product containing less than 25 per cent Australian fruit juice, sales tax was levied at the rate of 21 per cent. This preference for an Australian product can no longer be sustained in light of Australia's commitment to the new enlightened world trade which GATT has opened up. All juices or drinks which now contain at least 25 per cent actual juice, regardless of origin, will be taxed at 11 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, the citrus industry is disappointed at this development. That is understandable. It has certainly survived, although barely&mdash;in many cases in many parts of Australia&mdash;the threats from Brazilian frozen orange juice concentrate and is now going to lose that advantage. Brazil is the front runner for juice production in the world, which is partly due to its climatic conditions. In other words, in producing citrus, Brazil has a climatic advantage over many other countries in the world&mdash;and that is only one of its advantages. It does not need to irrigate. Also, due to its specialisation in the citrus industry, it has a fairly efficient labour force and labour costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the world stage, Australia is not significant as a citrus producer. It supplies just over one per cent of total world production. Nevertheless, the industry is significant to the Australian economy&mdash;and we should never lose sight of that fact. The industry is significant to Australia in its provision of significant regional employment opportunities, the export income it generates, the domestic market which it sustains and the jobs and wealth it creates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian citrus industry has long been troubled by Brazil. In light of the threat from Brazil of the concentrate entering our market, Australian orchardists have had great concerns. The Victorian electorate of the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) has a very important orchard, citrus and horticultural industry and I am sure he will outline in his address to the House some of the problems that the orchardists have and have had with Brazil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the changes to sales tax will be difficult for the industry, the industry certainly accepts that changes are necessary. The industry also finds that it is difficult to react swiftly to market changes. The member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) quite clearly identified that the 10-year lag between tree planting and economic production is an impediment to and a great hurdle for any citrus growers wanting to take advantage of changing varieties or to upgrade their orchards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In considering these bills the citrus industry has been concerned that the government has failed to report on its assistance package in relation to its horticultural task force report. The industry needs to hear what the government plans to do about addressing some of the problems that it is confronted with. The industry needs, for instance, structural assistance to ensure that the focus is on the competitive sectors of the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will be judged on what it offers the citrus industry. It is rather ironic that, once again, we have legislation before the House and we have had the government's horticultural task force report, but we have not seen what the government's assistance package is going to deliver to the citrus industry. Some dynamic changes are confronting the Australian agricultural sector, and the government has failed to bring forward its assistance package to complement the legislation which is today before the House. From the citrus growers' perspective, the package must contain immediate assistance for those orchardists suffering now. It must also offer long-term assistance to facilitate the evolution of an efficient and competitive industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax treatment of new planting is another area that the government must consider. The coalition strenuously urges the government to consider reworking the taxation treatment of expenditure on new horticultural plantations. The Industry Commission found that there was an anomaly in the taxation treatment of horticultural plantations relative to other industries. It really does discourage new investment and restructuring particularly, in this case, in the citrus and horticultural industry. The Industry Commission recommended that the tax treatment be revised to be more neutral between the industries. It would be in line with such neutral treatment received by United States and New Zealand counterparts who are, after all, competitors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The gains in terms of the GATT legislation, albeit small, are important. They certainly open doors around the world for our products in the future. Whilst we have got these gains to be made&mdash;efficient producers will make those gains&mdash;we also have to make sure that the government does not lose sight of the fact that much restructuring of the domestic taxation regime needs to take place in Australia. Whilst $900 million may be delivered to the agricultural sector as a result of these changes to the GATT rules, fuel tax and wholesale sales tax cost the agricultural sector in Australia $1.3 billion. So the government must not lose sight of the big picture once this legislation takes effect. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

A large number of bills have been brought together for this debate and they deal with many matters. I want to concentrate my remarks specifically on the dairy industry, which occupies a large part of my electorate of McMillan. Before doing so, I want to make a few comments about the trading system around the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The possibility of world trading systems evolving into regional trading blocs has been the subject of much speculation. The difficulties experienced in resolving the current round of GATT negotiations has led some commentators to question the prospects for an open multilateral trading system. The development of regional economic blocs in western Europe and North America through the completion of the single European market and the signing of NAFTA are the biggest examples of the move towards regional and subregional integration, which has accelerated in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other integration schemes include: the MERCOSUR treaty, aimed at economic integration of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay; the agreements reached in the framework of the Initiative for the Americas, aimed at ultimately creating a free trade area in the western hemisphere; several bilateral and subregional agreements in Latin America; the extension of the single European market through the European economic area; the integration of eastern and central European economies into western Europe; the attempts at integration in Asia and the Pacific through the upgrading of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation&mdash;APEC&mdash;and other initiatives; and the steps taken towards an integration of the country members of the Organisation of African Unity. All around the world, there are moves towards regional trading systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These regional integrations may encourage a more open world trading system via a general liberalisation of trade. For example, the economic bloc negotiated through the Australia-New Zealand closer economic relations treaty has helped reinforce pressures on both countries to open themselves to international trade. That treaty, negotiated and signed at the beginning of the 1980s, has seen the realisation of free trans-Tasman trade in Australasian goods: tariffs, quantitative restrictions and anti-dumping action have been removed from trans-Tasman trade. The removal of some of the artificial barriers to this trade has occurred at the same time as both New Zealand and Australia have been lowering tariff barriers to trade with the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the North American support for NAFTA has been concentrated amongst free traders who see it as an opportunity to encourage more open domestic economies. I have just had the pleasure of being part of a delegation of the Australian parliament that visited Mexico in the last two weeks, and I have seen first-hand its moves in the NAFTA arrangements. There are great benefits for those countries, and there are also great benefits for Australia. We should be very clear in our minds that these moves around the world have very positive impacts for our nation. We are a large trading nation. Most of our income still comes from exporting. It is my belief that the better and the freer the trade is, the better it will be for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through the Dairy Produce (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill, we are seeing a move of confidence by the dairy industry in this government. The bill amends the Dairy Produce Act 1986 by terminating market support payments to the dairy industry on 30 June 1995 or at the end of the financial year in which the World Trade Organisation agreement comes into force for Australia. This support for the industry was established under the 1986 Kerin plan and extended to the year 2000 under the 1992 Crean plan. The amendment is required to demonstrate to the Executive Council that Australia is in a position to fulfil its Uruguay Round commitments prior to signing the World Trade Organisation agreement on 1 January 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the event of the World Trade Organisation agreement not coming into force until after 1 July 1995, the bill provides for the planned termination of the market support payment scheme to be delayed until the first day of the next financial year after the financial year in which the World Trade Organisation agreement comes into force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further amendment to the Dairy Produce Act 1986 to provide a replacement support mechanism to take effect from 1 July 1995 will be introduced in the 1995 autumn sittings. I note that the National Party is expressing some concern through an amendment in relation to this. I am assured, and I represent one of the largest dairy industries in Australia, that the industry has great confidence in the negotiations that are taking place between the government and the industry. That is based on the fact that, over the last 12 years, this government has proved itself to be one of the great initiators of developing an industry, such as the dairy industry, to the benefit of not only the producers but also the consumers and Australia as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major aim of the 1986 and 1992 dairy plans was to improve the industry's competitiveness both domestically and internationally. This includes phasing out market support payments to the dairy industry by the year 2000 in a way that allows the industry to adjust at a satisfactory pace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The market support payment scheme is essentially a domestic market support scheme delivered through payments on exports of dairy products and financed by a levy on all milk. The payment encourages manufacturers to export and forces domestic consumers to pay the equivalent of world export prices plus the per unit market support payment to divert manufactured products to the domestic market. This raises the price of dairy products to domestic consumers above the export parity price creating what is termed a consumer transfer to the dairy industry. The market support payment is paid by the Australian Dairy Corporation to manufacturers on the basis of the export of dairy products. This payment and the consumer transfer are then available to be passed back to suppliers of domestic milk for manufacturing. Under the 1992 plan, the scheme is to be terminated on 30 June 2000. </PARA>

The final act, inter alia, commits signatories to reduce export subsidies on agricultural products progressively between 1995-96 and 2000-01 by 36 per cent in expenditure terms and by 21 per cent in volume from the base period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The definition of an export subsidy agreed during the Uruguay Round includes any payment for export of a product financed by a levy either on the product itself or on products derived from it. This definition encompasses the market support payments to the Australian dairy industry, provided for under the Dairy Produce Act 1986, as the payments are financed by a levy imposed on milk produced, albeit a levy financed by the dairy industry itself. The market support payments, now in place, are not constructed to handle volume constraints in meeting Australia's obligations to reduce the subsidy. Consequently, a new mechanism for delivering domestic market support needs to be devised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Executive Council approval is required before Australia can sign the World Trade Organisation agreement, and the Governor-General will need to be assured that Australia has passed legislation to give effect to its commitments before Australia becomes a signatory. It is a strongly held convention that there should be legislative backing for commitments entered into prior to Australia signing international agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is working in close cooperation with leaders of the Australian dairy industry to develop new market support arrangements which are consistent with GATT and Australia's Uruguay Round commitments. However, due to the complexities involved, negotiations on a new mechanism will not be completed in sufficient time for the passage of legislation before Australia is expected to sign the world trade agreement on 1 January 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, a two-stage approach to meeting Australia's commitments is proposed. The first stage involves amending the Dairy Produce Act 1986 in the 1994 spring sittings to assure the Governor-General that the Uruguay Round commitments can be met. The simplest way of achieving this is to bring forward the date of termination of the market support scheme from 30 June 2000 to 30 June 1995, or to the end of the financial year in which the World Trade Organisation agreement comes into force for Australia, thus clearly meeting the commitments by eliminating the scheme. The second stage is the passage of further amendments to the Dairy Produce Act 1986 in the autumn sittings of 1995 to enable the implementation of a new and transparent support mechanism which is consistent with the Uruguay Round commitments from 1 July 1995, and which would provide for levels of domestic support consistent with those agreed to in the 1992 dairy plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government appreciates that those involved in the industry may be concerned about future levels of market support in circumstances where the current payments are being terminated without alternative arrangements having been agreed to. The government has therefore advised the dairy industry that it will provide the industry with an equivalent level of domestic market support from 1 July 1995, which is as close as possible to that which would have been provided under the current support arrangements, given the difficulties of formulating alternative schemes. The dairy industry itself supports the two-stage approach and supports the effect of the bill, having been assured of continued market support as noted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the National Party wishes to move an amendment expressing its concerns. It is quite evident from negotiations that are taking place between this government and the dairy industry that the confidence of the industry is such that it is willing to work through the issues in relation to its future. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that there is a very bright future for the dairy industry. The move towards free trade within the dairy industry in the last 10 years has created circumstances whereby Australia is very well positioned in that industry to become a major provider to the world of a food that is in great demand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Victoria, the state that I represent, produces 62 per cent of the national production of dairy products. The figures for the other states of Australia&mdash;including Sydney, Brisbane and the major cities up the coast&mdash;show that the great bulk of their production is still in the market milk sectors whereas Victoria's production, as far as the market milk figures are concerned, is becoming smaller and smaller as it produces more and more milk for export. I am concerned at the moment that we do not find ourselves in a situation where there is going to be any slowing down of the structural changes that are taking place in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, I was a member of the delegation to Mexico. Mexico has an enormous demand for a milk product called infant milk powder. We have been successful through the Dairy Corporation in breaking into that market in a substantial way. Our problem in Australia today is that we do not have enough of the product. It is a speciality product. Our industry needs to invest in it. There need to be moves to make sure that we continue to invest in it and that investment depends on decision making processes within the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming from Gippsland, I have some grave concerns at the moment that the production is going up. The Victorian figures of the number of dairy farms registered and the number of stock being put through the dairy sheds show that there has not been a great drop in the number of stock but that there has been a large drop in the number of registered farms. In other words, Victoria has become a very efficient producer of the product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that we are not quite keeping up with the farmer at present. The decision makers who need to make those investment decisions appear to be in a bit of a quandary as to where they are going to go. I know that factories in Gippsland that were thought to be redundant have been reopened this year. They are producing a product that they may have some difficulty disposing of simply because it is not the product the market really requires. The Mexican market certainly will not want to buy some of the product that we are putting through some of our older factories today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Victoria's electricity is produced in Gippsland, and in my electorate in particular, which will be going into the national grid. You might ask, `What does electricity have to do with the dairy industry in this regard?' We have the opportunity in Gippsland right now to build a new superfactory&mdash;one that can produce the product that Australia needs to sell to the market that is out there. To do that a large investment is needed. If we tie that in with the restructure of the SEC and the breakdown of the power stations, we have an opportunity where the power stations themselves can go out and bid for business. Therefore, they are in a position to make better use of the steam they are producing in power stations rather than just producing electricity and letting it go up to the sky. They can put their milk factory close to a power station, something unheard of in the past because milk factories tended to be built politically where the dairy situation dictated they should be built rather than for economic reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The structural changes we have put in place are making power stations focus on economic reasons. It is strange to see the Hazelwood power station group, which has been broken up by the Kennett government, out there talking to the dairy industry right now. That group is saying, `You need to build a new factory. If you put it in La Trobe Valley, which is in the centre of Gippsland, you can bring your milk from the east and your irrigation from the west where it occurs naturally. We have the capacity to double our production in that area without any effort, but what we need is a superfactory.' For the superfactory to survive would not need to be run for a full year. It would perhaps need to be run for eight or nine months with large volumes of production. All of this is possible today. Enterprise agreements can be negotiated. The unions in my area have negotiated enterprise agreements across all spheres of production. There would be no problem negotiating an enterprise agreement were a factory to be developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second advantage of being near a power station and having access to steam and other energy sources is that the electricity and steam will be cheaper. The factory will not need boilers, which it would need if it were built away from that site. If it is built on that site, the factory will be built cheaper. At the moment, a lot of the milk factories in Gippsland are carting briquettes, which are made from coal, from the power station to their milk factories. All these added costs are unnecessary if they sit down and work out the economics of the whole operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Gippsland we have a golden opportunity with the restructuring that is going on to become the focus of the dairy industry in a very big way, particularly in relation to export markets. It is of some concern that some of this year's production from some of these factories will not be easy to sell or, if it is sold, it will not be sold at a profitable price that will provide a decent return to the whole industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I think that can be overcome if this restructuring process is put in place. In other words, as the national grid policy initiated by this government has full effect in Victoria, when we see efficiencies coming through in the power stations and we see a willingness to make better use of the available steam and energy and, at the same time, the dairy industry focuses on the market opportunities and makes correct decisions, there will be improvements in this area. In the Gippsland area at this time 40 per cent of the dairying capacity is being used to run beef. Once it is economically viable and the markets are on a solid footing those properties can return to dairying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are going through the cycle at the moment where farmers who paid for their properties in the past have gone into beef for 15 or 20 years. Those properties are now being passed over to other people who are taking the opportunity to reinvest. I would expect to see in the next 10 years a large surge in production from the Gippsland region. It is a natural region for producing milk because we do not have to irrigate and we do not have the problems of drought which can affect production. We can use this increased production to service the world markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having seen the demand that exists in places like Mexico, provided we produce the right product, the market is out there. I hope that those involved at all levels of decision making take into account the necessary parameters that are needed to make the right decisions, to build the factories in the right places and to use the right facilities for production so that we can tap those world markets and make Australia a better place not just for the dairy industry but for our own economy, and also provide a much needed product to many of the nations around the world that need what we can produce in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am a little disappointed that the World Trade Organisation amendment bills have been lumped into a cognate debate. I am sure we could benefit from a debate on each one of the bills. I thank the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham) for his contribution on behalf of the dairy industry. I know we could have several hours of debate on that industry alone. My concerns relate specifically to how the Sales Tax (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill 1994 affects the citrus industry in my electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has always been recognised that, in the desperate scramble for world trade reform, there would be winners and losers in Australia as we sought to demonstrate to the rest of the world our willingness to do the right thing. The citrus industry happens to be one of the losers. The stark reality is that we need to recognise that in a nation like Australia, which is really a small trading nation internationally, we have some very large industries that stand to gain substantially from free trade. My constituents resent the fact that they have been asked to bear the brunt of this trade reform. Apart from the dried vine fruit industry, which is also in my electorate, I do not think that there would be any other horticultural industry in Australia that has had to suffer more pain than the citrus industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always said that we need to have GATT up and running. God help Australia if we cannot make GATT work. Once we have the GATT agreements in place, we need to use the rules of the GATT to our advantage. For many industries the pace of reform has been far too fast and it has been beyond their capacity to adjust. The member for McMillan spoke about the dairy industry. There is a significant amount of dairying on the Tyntynder Flats near Swan Hill, which is in my electorate. The dairy industry is not as large as it is in Gippsland or in the electorate of the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd). Several years ago that industry went through significant structural reform. It needs to be remembered that the ambitions and prospects of prosperity for dairying have been bought with great pain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the people associated with the citrus industry in my area are a determined group. They have attempted to accept the challenges presented to them. For example, the dried vine fruit industry has suffered as a result of reductions in trade barriers and severe and substantial competition from Turkish imports. In the first two years after the reduction in tariffs, it lost over a third of the domestic sale of dried vine fruit, particularly sultanas, to Turkish imports. But the growers have worked very hard and, based on the quality of the product, they have won back a substantial part of that domestic market. That is an example of the determination of the people out there, particularly those associated with the Sunraysia region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the growers operated joint dried fruit and citrus operations. With respect to dried vine fruits, it needs to be remembered that the price for the commodity in the last five or six years has not increased but that the costs of production have. They continue to increase inexorably upwards, seemingly with no assistance from the government to reduce those costs. I think it is time for decisions to be made with respect to the citrus industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had inquiry after inquiry. Recently the Industry Commission conducted an inquiry into the horticultural industry which addressed the citrus industry. More recently than that a task force produced a report which dealt specifically with the citrus industry. We have been waiting for almost six months for a response from the government to the recommendations contained in that task force report. I was hoping that, before this legislation came into this House, we could confidently say to the beleaguered citrus growers that we had a plan to cement their future, that would give them some hope and direction. I was thinking of something similar to that which happened in the dairying industry a decade or so ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Indi (Mr Lieberman), who is in the chamber, has a tobacco industry in his electorate. Many tobacco growers are almost financially ruined; they are one of the losers of the GATT negotiations. I would ask the government to hear the expressions of concern by the coalition. Whilst we have agreed to allow the second reading of this legislation, we have expressed concerns. Previous speakers have expressed concerns about dairying. Whilst we have not formally moved an amendment to the Sales Tax (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill, I think the government needs to be aware that we share the concerns that have been consistently expressed to the government by the citrus industry itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to reinforce the comments made earlier in the House by the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) so that people around here really understand the nature of the citrus industry as it operates in the southern states, including Victoria. Over 30 years ago, citrus used for fresh juice was granted a concessional rate. Unlike Queensland, which enjoys a different climate and a different type of product and where the emphasis has been on a fresh fruit market, the emphasis in the southern states of South Australia and Victoria and the Riverina region of New South Wales has been on a fresh juice market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The success of the fresh juice market can be seen in the production figures, as consumers have adopted this as a preferred way to consume their citrus juice. A carton of orange juice in the fridge has become as familiar as a carton of milk. I have always found it curious that, whilst milk does not attract sales tax, citrus juice does. That is the major point of contention for citrus growers today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The emphasis in the citrus industry has been on the demand for fresh fruit. The industry has been concentrating on exporting fresh fruit. There has been a historical emphasis on fresh juice. Two-thirds of the volume of the crop has been directed to juice and only one-third has been made available traditionally for fresh fruit. That is because of the high demand for quality. Because of our need to compete in the US, particularly in California, there is an emphasis on quality, which means that a substantial amount of product of an inferior quality that is not acceptable finds itself on the juice market. So the industry continues to be reliant on fresh juice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This parliament has asked the citrus industry to change this practice dramatically, but I do not think the parliament appreciates the difficulties experienced by this industry which is attempting to compete with a nation like Brazil. Brazil specifically concentrates on fresh juice; it does not bother with fruit. When citrus growers in Brazil pick their fruit it is green. They are not after the fruit but the juice. The juice is concentrated, frozen and exported all over the world. No country can compete with Brazil's concentrate product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Citrus growers have been telling us of their difficulties for a number of years now, but they have not received an adequate response from the government. Right now they are particularly galled that the government responded to the needs of the Maritime Union of Australia which, when it recently held the nation to ransom with its strike right across Australia, was bleating about the fact that it could not compete with cheap labour crews from Third World countries&mdash;something that my citrus growers have been asked to do for the last four or five years. But the Maritime Union of Australia complained that it could not compete. What was it granted? It was granted tax-free status without the need for an Industry Commission report and without 12 months being set aside for a specific task force report. The government made a decision just like that in order to assist the Maritime Union of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My citrus growers resent the fact that some Australians have been given particular status without considered debate or considered input from a wide range of community bodies when they have been asked to bear pain and go without. They see their children go to school in second-hand clothing. Their children are suffering the embarrassment of missing out on excursions because there just is not enough money to go around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The citrus industry has risen to the challenges that have been put before it in the past. Its exports have increased from 20 to 60 per cent in four years. Despite the financial woes of the industry and the growers themselves, they have leapt to the challenges put before them. However, they have not been given adequate consideration by this government. It concerns me that, considering the length of time it takes to get a decision from the government, we are about to pass legislation in the House without knowing the government's plan for my beleaguered citrus growers. I think it is perfectly acceptable for us to ask the questions that we have been asking in this debate. We look forward to the government's response to the citrus task force report. We hope it is not too long before there is subsequent discussion and debate on these bills before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear a lot from the government about the importance of regional development. It seems to be the buzz word around this place. In all the regions in which citrus is produced&mdash;the strong Murray-Darling region, the Riverina, the Murrumbidgee, the Murray River through my area of Sunraysia right down to the Riverland in South Australia, the lower Darling and Menindee&mdash;we already have an industry and an infrastructure out there that is being systematically eroded in its security and its potential for prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national citrus industry profile is something that we ought to look at with a vision for even greater regional development. Although citrus is still quite small in national terms, it is becoming a significant horticultural industry. It is certainly the backbone of regions in my electorate. Some 32,800 hectares of orchards across Australia produce 803,000 tonnes of fresh fruit equivalent. It is an industry that is worth $225 million to the nation. It produces income in regional areas. There are 2,600 growers, 400 packing sheds and 11 major juice producers across the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is significant&mdash;I am quite proud of the fact&mdash;that 84 per cent of citrus is produced in river irrigation districts of the Riverland, the Murray Valley and the Riverina, which are areas associated with the electorates of the member for Riverina (Mr Hicks), the member for Wakefield and me. We all speak with a passion on behalf of beleaguered citrus growers. Western Australia and Queensland make up the balance of that figure, which is still a significant contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nation stands to benefit immensely from a viable citrus industry. I think it is indicative of the significance of this industry that the government receives $50 million revenue from sales tax on it. I think it is time, and there is a need now, for decisions to be made to secure the future of citrus growers and their families. As previous speakers have already said, we are looking to the government to make a decision about whether it will pick up the initiatives recommended by the citrus task force and whether it will produce a package to compensate for this legislation before us now, which is to remove a concessional rate on fresh juice, an advantage given to Australian producers just to satisfy the GATT and to in turn satisfy the needs of much larger industries. I think it is fair and reasonable for citrus growers to be asking for some compensatory support so that they can go on and be a major building block in terms of regional development across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude with some comment on what that package might contain. We certainly do not want another inquiry. I think it is time for decisions, as I said earlier. It is incumbent on the government to at least make some form of taxation incentive available for the planting of new trees. If we are to depart from the practice of growing a summer Valencia crop, which is essentially a juice crop, and move more towards a navel crop, giving away the fresh juice industry altogether and leaving that to the Brazilians, which seems to be the scorched earth mentality, then growers will need an incentive and encouragement to reinvest in new plantations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that concerns growers is that they have orchards that are producing. To remove a tree in favour of a better variety, growers have to face the prospect that it will be many years&mdash;five, six or seven years&mdash;before they can get back to sustainable quantity production. That is a big ask for any industry. The sad fact is that, if they are left in the deep end, they will continue producing a fresh juice crop of the value of $40 a tonne which costs them $150 a tonne to produce. That is not sustainable. Nobody in this House would run a business with such a huge differential. So I await with some anxiety the government's response to the citrus task force report. I forewarn the government that I will be determined to pursue a reasonable and decent package that gives citrus growers some sort of encouragement that there is a future for them as they continue to struggle to survive. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By coincidence, this week is citrus week. Members of the House might ask: what is the significance of citrus week? Members may not be aware that the citrus industry is one of the largest horticultural industries in Australia with a gross value of production of fruit estimated by ABARE at $278 million in 1992-93. Australia produces less than two per cent of the world output and our exports are less than one per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Citrus production occurs in all mainland states and over 80 per cent of all Australian citrus is grown in the major irrigated horticultural regions of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. Those areas are represented by the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest), the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) and the member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), all of whom have spoken on this bill. Those areas are the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area, in which I live, the Sunraysia and the mid-Murray regions of New South Wales and Victoria, and the Riverland region of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry creates a great deal of employment and is of economic importance to all of those regions. While each of the growing areas has distinctive characteristics, such as the varietal mix and the ripening period, there are two broad areas in which they can be placed. In one group are the southern producing areas of the MIA, Sunraysia and the Riverland, which have traditionally relied on the processing sector to absorb up to two-thirds of their fruit with the rest of the output sold on the fresh domestic and export market, although, I must say, those areas are trying to produce more fruit for the fresh fruit market for domestic and export use and also for the fresh fruit juice market. The other area is Queensland, which sells the majority of its fruit to domestic and export fresh outlets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is ironic that during citrus week I have to take this opportunity to point out to the House the diabolical situation in which citrus growers find themselves with many of their problems resulting from decisions of government, which over the past 11 years has been a Labor government. I would first like to give a brief history of the citrus industry going back to 1976 when the need for imported orange juice concentrate increased. The industry was placed under extreme economic pressure due to the price disparity of orange juice concentrate manufactured in very low cost countries such as Brazil and Mexico. Unfortunately, that condition applies today, particularly in relation to Brazil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1976 more adequate tariff arrangements were provided by the then federal government under the guidance of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), to ensure that the local industry was protected against this unfair competition from imported orange juice concentrate. However, under the present government's low tariff, free trade policies with inadequate reduction in on-farm and off-farm production costs, this import tariff protection has been gradually reducing. As of 1 July 1996, it will equal only five per cent of the ad valorem price of the imported product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1983 there was an IAC inquiry into orange and mandarin juice. The citrus industry supported the composite tariff principle recommended by the IAC, provided the floor price was built into the arrangement to protect the industry against any dramatic fall in world prices of orange juice concentrate. Following the government's decision to maintain the phasing down of tariff arrangements, the citrus industry made strong representations to the government to ensure the sales tax exemption applicable to fruit juices and fruit juice products containing not less than 25 per cent of Australian fruit juice was maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1984, the industry again made strong representations to ensure that the 25 per cent sales tax exemption on Australian fruit juice was maintained. In line with the closer economic relationship with New Zealand, amending legislation was passed to provide sales tax exemption for New Zealand fruit juice products. In 1985, the tariff continued to be wound down as it was also in 1986. Of course, Brazil, the world's largest orange juice producer, had a tariff advantage of five per cent because it was considered to be a developing country. This was despite the fact that Australian citrus could not compete in cost with the Brazilian product. Growers also sought a temporary increase in the tariff to help cushion the effect of the low Brazilian prices and to offset the developing country preference decision. The processing sector lodged a legitimate claim for anti-dumping duty to be imposed on imports from Brazil following the collapse in world orange juice concentrate prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be remembered that a sales tax concession on fruit juice products was first introduced in 1940 during World War II with products containing at least 25 per cent Australian fruit juice being completely exempt from sales tax. This exemption for products containing not less than 25 per cent Australian fruit juice was maintained until 1986. It was in 1986 that the Hawke Labor government, with the now Prime Minister (Mr Keating) as Treasurer, created a particular anomaly by imposing a sales tax of 10 per cent on single strength juice and did particular damage to the citrus industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is the person who attacked the coalition on its first GST package, which placed a tax on food. That seems more than a little hypocritical, does it not? The tax was not imposed on fresh milk, tea, coffee and other items. The budget papers of that year admitted that the retail price of orange juice would rise by 11.5c per litre and there would be consumer opposition to the purchase of orange juice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1987, following the return of the IAC inquiry, the government reversed the December 1986 automatic phase down on the tariff on imported orange juice concentrate. The successful application by the processors, supported by the growers, resulted in a non-injurious export floor price of $1,640 per tonne of concentrate free on board Brazil for a period of up to three years with anti-dumping duties being applicable if the price fell below that level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1988 the industry reinforced the need for special sales tax arrangements for fruit juice products. The grower-processor sector negotiated with the government to have a floor price variable tariff mechanism built into the tariff arrangements to complement any anti-dumping legislation and to prevent serious disruption to the industry in the event of a sudden sustained drop in the world price for orange juice, as occurred in 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989 the import tariff structure was changed from a combined ad valorem specific tariff basis, which encouraged high quality imports, to a straight ad valorem tariff system, where the tariff was based purely on unit values and not on quality. In 1990 tariffs were further phased down to 21 per cent ad valorem for developed countries and 16 per cent for developing countries. There was also an increased threat of the removal of the tax concession on the 25 per cent Australia-New Zealand fruit juice content, which was recommended by the IAC, and the industry continued with submissions to government opposing this proposition. So we can see how important this 25 per cent tax concession was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991 the government announced that tariffs on imported citrus juice would continue being phased down until they reached five per cent ad valorem for developing countries and zero tariff for produce from developed countries as of 1 July 1996. Following representations from the industry, the federal government formed a Commonwealth-state citrus advisory group to analyse the citrus industry and to identify constraints and propose recommendations. The government's decision to remove the 25 per cent local content requirement in the sales tax arrangement for fruit juice as from 1 July 1991 was deferred on recommendation from the citrus advisory group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992 the industry stated concern that Brazil, which was the world's major producer of citrus products at the lowest cost, was being given developing nation status by Australia as far as tariff imposition was concerned whereas the US was being given developed nation status. Around that time, the market for fresh style 100 per cent Australian juice increased rapidly, representing 15 to 20 per cent of the total chilled orange juice market. Funds from the federal government to the Australian Horticultural Council were used to promote the product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision by the federal government to freeze the developing country preference on fruit juice and other commodities at the existing level was welcomed by the industry in 1993. This meant that the import tariff rate for 1993-94 on fruit juice concentrate being imported from Brazil for that period remained at 10 per cent. The general tariff was phased down to 12 per cent ad valorem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government officially established a citrus working group as part of the Australian horticultural task force with the responsibility of formulating an industry growth strategy for the Australian citrus industry. That was strongly welcomed by the industry. The 10 per cent import tariff on Brazilian concentrated orange juice has remained in 1993-94 and will continue in 1994-95. The rate of tariff is scheduled to be reduced to eight per cent on 1 July 1995 and reach its base level of five per cent on 1 July 1996. Today the citrus industry is waiting for comment from the federal government on the recommendations of the citrus working group that I mentioned earlier. This report to government has been ready for some time but the government is taking its time to announce its reaction to the package for the industry, obviously waiting for this bill to be passed first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I recognise and agree overall with the comments of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) of the benefits of GATT&mdash;I believe that a number of Australian industries will certainly benefit, as will the citrus industry in the long term&mdash;government policy will have to take into account that the government has signed off on GATT, in relation to citrus, with Australia having a current applied tariff rate on frozen concentrated orange juice of 10 per cent and a projected rate of five per cent compared with the United States figures of 47 per cent and 40 per cent; Brazil, 105 per cent and 35 per cent; Israel, 142 per cent and 120 per cent; South Africa, 20 per cent and the projected rate remaining at 20 per cent; and Japan, 35 per cent and 25.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that, by 1 January next year the government is going to extend the preferred sales tax of 11 per cent on Australian juice that contains over 25 per cent of local product to all juices of similar strength no matter what country they initiate from. Other juices with less than 25 per cent will continue to have a 21 per cent sales tax. This Sales Tax (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill 1994, if passed, will enable this to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have outlined a history of the citrus industry to indicate that, despite the best endeavours of, particularly, the citrus growers, governments continue to make its existence even more difficult. I agree with the Australian Citrus Growers Federation that a package which does the following should be adopted by the government: allows a zero rating on all 100 per cent juice products; maintains an 11 per cent concessional sales tax rate for products with 25 per cent or more fruit content; and maintains a sales tax as at present on products with less than 25 per cent fruit content. While this would result in a loss of $40 million per annum in revenue, I believe this is the way to go if the industry is to survive and prosper&mdash;given the amount of tax that has already been collected from the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the opposition parties cannot amend legislation in a way that imposes a cost on the government. So, if the government does not adopt these requests, we as an opposition must see what else can be done to assist the industry, such as allowing deductibility for depreciation on horticultural plantations as was recommended in the IC report, but this would only be one measure that could be taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be up to the opposition in the Senate, after learning what the government's response is to the recommendations of the horticultural task force, to ensure that the citrus industry receives due recompense as a result of its falling an innocent victim to the GATT. It is fitting that this week's legislation dealing with anti-dumping and truth in labelling is being considered by the parliament. While both pieces of legislation are not earth shattering, they give some small assistance to the citrus industry. Tomorrow, the Riverina Citrus Marketing Board will be holding its annual general meeting in Griffith within the MIA. It is a pity that the government has not responded to the report of the horticultural task force. If it had, that organisation could have had clearer guidelines on which to base its support for a battle to obtain justice for the industry, given the sorry deal that has come the way of the citrus industry on past occasions and at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my real hope that the establishment of the citrus working group, as part of the horticultural task force, will not be just a shonky exercise but a serious attempt to assist the industry. I believe that the citrus industry believed that it would make a serious attempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The long overdue statements to be made by the minister next week will enlighten us on this matter. We in the coalition must be prepared to do what we can to obtain a fair and equitable result for the industry and for all those people who rely on that industry for employment. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I share many of the concerns that have been expressed. This is a major package of legislation and one which gives me concern. The package postulates a world of free trade, a world of level trade and a world of Ricardo's wonderful theory of comparative advantage. It postulates a world, frankly, which does not exist and, in my view, a world which will never exist. For example, it postulates that the United States will become a member of GATT. The simple fact is that the United States has never been a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It has never signed it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look at the American political scene at the moment, with the Congressional elections coming up, you will see that there seems to be no intention on the part of the US Congress to endorse the Uruguay Round of GATT.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will wait and see, won't we? But even if the United States finally, and belatedly, becomes a member of GATT, when will it cease its export enhancement package&mdash;EEP? When will the United States stop using wetback labour by allowing people to cross the borders? When will it stop employing people under conditions that are indicative of Third World countries, not modern industrial nations? This package postulates all of that. It assumes that Malaysia is going to remove its 70 per cent tariff on Australian imports. It postulates that Thailand is going to remove its 57 per cent tariff on Australian imports. In fact, it postulates that, suddenly, our exports are going to find easy and ready access into world marketplaces. It does not talk about non-tariff controls and it does not talk about how we stop countries from invidiously using health, quarantine and a whole host of other devices to stop our products entering their marketplaces.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there is no greater example of that than in France. The French are very good at finding ways to stop other countries' exports from entering their marketplace. For example, they can find a new system of electrical standards to be placed on video recorders. They are very good at stopping a shipload of VCRs from entering France because of new standards imposed on video recorders. Therefore, these video recorders will be held in bond for 12 months and have added storage costs before they get into their marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The French are not alone. I was in Europe last year and I met with many members of the European Parliament. I can tell this House that European parliamentarians have no intention of making it easy for our products to enter Europe. There is no intention whatsoever. Are the French, for example&mdash;with their delightful countryside and villages every five kilometres, and whose whole social structure is historically being decentralised&mdash;suddenly going to destroy their infrastructure in social terms to create large economic farm units, as we have? I doubt it very much. Indeed, one could ask: why should the French destroy their social structure which has been developed over centuries&mdash;their small holdings, inefficient though they are? The French are not going to do that, no matter what we do in this country and no matter how wonderful in economic theory terms this legislation is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are the Americans going to stop? I doubt it. The Americans will stop it only when it suits their internal political and domestic purposes. So whilst we&mdash;quite properly, in economic terms&mdash;put this package before the House, I am not convinced that the benefits will necessarily flow through to our producers, nor am I currently convinced that the rest of the world is prepared to follow our path. That concerns me greatly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look at the anti-dumping laws of Australia and the changes proposed by one piece of legislation in this package, you should have greater concern. My views on anti-dumping laws are no secret to those who have known me over the years in the House and in the caucus. As a backbencher, I have tended to specialise in Australia's anti-dumping laws. I have had many arguments with many ministers, including the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones). The new Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) is yet to experience them. These arguments have been over what I believe is an irrational approach to the way Customs controls our dumping laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I well recall two particular cases: tyres and cement. The cement case is very instructive and should be looked at by this House. It involved the importation of Korean and Japanese cement into Australia at an unarguably dumped price. The target was primarily Perth. An anti-dumping case was brought by Perth producers of cement. Our wonderful bureaucrats from Customs, saying that they were applying GATT and anti-dumping rules, found that Perth was a separate market and that the Australian domestic marketplace was not impacted upon by dumped cement coming into Perth. They held that material injury had not been demonstrated. At the time I found that to be rather ludicrous, to say the least. Australia is an enormous country in size. Very few countries are similar to us in size and in the structure of our cities and the distances between them. The suggestion that the Australian domestic market does not include Perth&mdash;3,000 kilometres across the Nullarbor&mdash;seemed to me to be a joke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does that have do with this legislation? By this legislation, we are now proposing to put percentages on what needs to be impacted upon in dumped products on the domestic marketplace. Let us take a situation that may occur. A new high technology industry starts off in this country. It is low in capital and high in skill, energy and endeavour. It has a good product and a good, long-term future. It commences its business in Perth. It puts in capital and gets equipment and machinery. It employs staff and starts to produce its product, as all new capital ventures do. Then it finds that it is competing with products dumped in the Australian marketplace by a country that does not pay the same wages and that subsidises various factors on its internal domestic marketplace. The industry says, `We will go to Australian dumping law and bring anti-dumping action against this country.' What will happen to it? Under the legislation proposed by this House, because this industry is in Perth and has not yet expanded into the domestic market of Australia, it will not have redress against dumping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that should gravely concern members. It is not much different, I might add, from the way the bureaucrats of Customs interpreted the old GATT rules. I am a lawyer and I happened to get a copy of GATT. It took me a long while because it is all over the place. I read GATT, including its anti-dumping provisions, some years ago. This is one of the reasons I became very angry when I read about the cement case. GATT clearly enabled our bureaucrats to prevent the dumped importation of cement. It clearly enabled them to stop it, but they did not. So my bigger worry about this package of legislation is, again, that the people who are going to enforce it appear to be imbued with the idea of neo-classical economic theory. They are bureaucrats. If you read Pusey's book&mdash;and I think that every member of this House should read it&mdash;you will become even more concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me, as a lawyer, that you can read anything you like into a document. You can read anything you like into GATT. It is the most loosely written legal document I have ever read. Other countries read it in a way which gives their markets some protection. Other countries find in GATT various loopholes which, I might add, are built into that document to ensure that their domestic marketplaces are treated in a fairer way than I suspect ours is going to be. As I said, I do not have faith in our bureaucrats and the way they will interpret GATT. Their history so far has been abysmal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said all of that, let me say that I am not necessarily a supporter of tariffs. I have bothered to go back and read the Vernon report of some years ago, and I believe there is no doubt that tariffs, as they were applied in this country, were not beneficial. One cannot argue against that case at all. In fact, tariffs kept Australian industry featherbedded, backward and non-technological, and provided Australian industry with no capital growth. They did nothing for us. When one looks at the result of the industry packages Senator Button put up when he was trade minister, one can see strong evidence that, when governments and industry work collectively, looking at markets for change and the reduction of tariffs, they can achieve wonders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The car industry alone is an example. Down to four, we now export cars from this country. If I had been told 20 years ago that we would be exporting cars to Japan, Germany or the United States, I would have laughed. It would have been a dream. The quality of our cars made in Australia have improved beyond comprehension. So it is unarguable that the straight tariff approach does not work, but it is arguable very strongly that government and industry together can make things work. My plea to the government, and my effort with the government, will be to look at ways in which we can use GATT as a document, look at ways we can use what the rest of the world is doing in preventing our access to the marketplace and look at ways we can make our economy productive and better without destroying that which we have in it too rapidly as a result of the rapid change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard many members talk of the citrus industry. It might surprise many to hear that, when I was a member of the Country Task Force way back in 1984, one of the groups that I got to know was the Australian citrus industry. It had problems then, and it has problems now. I do not think this will assist that industry at all. I find it sad that we are not doing anything to help a restructure so that those productive horticultural growing areas in a whole host of horticultural capacities are not being better utilised. I think very few countries would allow this to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, let us not fool ourselves that it is necessarily unfair competition from Brazil. The simple reality is that Brazil is using high-tech means of growing citrus. Its growers are in a constant rainfall area and do not need irrigation. They use mechanised means for stripping their trees. They are light years ahead of our traditional citrus farming techniques, and hence they do it cheaper and better. I do not think I could argue in this House that Brazil, in terms of citrus growing, is presenting in any way necessarily unfair competition. Rather, it seems to me, we need to look at ways we can improve our citrus growers and assist in getting a better deal for them in the 20th century in production terms. It might mean that we should be looking at ways of improving our irrigation. We are the most wasteful people in the world with water, probably because it has been too cheap for farmers, and we need to do something about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I will support these bills, I do so reluctantly. I will certainly be raising my concerns with ministers, particularly about the anti-dumping laws and the changes to them, as I have done in previous years. I understand the concerns of members of the National Party in regard to the citrus industry. It will not impact just on the citrus industry but also on other horticultural industries. But I do not think we will solve the problems simply by being negative about the need to restructure Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Change is violent sometimes, and people do suffer. Without disrespect to Australian rural producers, there is no more conservative group of people in Australia in terms of change. After all, the manufacturing industry in Victoria was taken kicking and screaming to find the new goalposts that they are now working with. </PARA>

The beneficiaries of that deal are not the union members but the shipping industry&mdash;the stevedores. The stevedoring companies are the major beneficiaries of the changes we have made to the tax laws there. It came out of a report to the government which was supported by members on the other side. I do not think we should make the sorts of silly comments that I have heard some members make about the great deal that union members got with those changes. Their wage levels, in net terms, do not change at all.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In tonight's adjournment debate, I bring to the attention of the House the situation confronting a number of my constituents as a result of the current drought. I would like to read a letter from Mr Donald Gray, from Byabarra, just west of Port Macquarie, outside of Wauchope. The letter states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Sirs</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This letter is to explain our position brought about entirely by the current drought which appears to have claimed our total income this second year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have been farming on the Mid North Coast of NSW west of Port Macquarie since 1963. Our district has been in drought for the major portion of the past four years as backed up by the quoted local rainfall figures our average annual being 1300mm</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1991&mdash;676mm</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1992&mdash;993mm</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1993&mdash;705mm</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1994&mdash;373mm to 30 September 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since 1901 the lowest recorded rainfall was in 1941&mdash;653mm. To equal the lowest rainfall on record we would need to have rainfall of 280mm over the last two and a half months of 1994. Weather forecasters do not predict any appreciable falls until 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The remainder of our cattle are now being run out on local roads as there is no agistment available and we cannot afford to buy feed for them. Prices for cattle have dropped dramatically as the drought worsens and we are endeavouring to carry our breeding stock through until the drought breaks. If there is no significant rainfall by December we will be forced to sell or dispose of our stock.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the past 15 years we have been operating Grain Harvesters and during the last 10 years the major portion of our income has come from these operations, harvesting from Roma in Queensland to the Victorian Border then back to the North Coast of NSW to seed which is exported to the USA and other parts of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last year our gross income was $160,000 of which $46,000 was paid out in wages to a total of 12 part-time employees as we moved through the eastern States. The total gross income has been spent running the operation and we have a shortfall of $40,000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our gross income for the previous year was in excess of $260,000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are members of the Australian Grain Harvesters Association and are recognised as aids to Agriculture. Our 3 machines can only harvest grains and seeds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the present system we do not qualify for any assistance from the Rural Assistance Scheme because more than 51% of our income is considered to be off farm even though it is actually earned harvesting primary production crops on other farms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are asking for assistance through the Rural Assistance Scheme and suggest loans of $60,000 at 4% repayable during second and third years after the drought breaks and reverting to commercial rates after that time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is most important that Jobsearch or the equivalent through the Social Security System be made available to our Association Members and a large number of harvest operators outside in order to keep these families and specialised operations together and be available when the drought breaks. I believe that the two assistance packages outlined above will achieve this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">According to a letter published in the Land Newspaper 6 October 1994 written by David Smith Vice Chairman New England Bank Watch Armidale the Federal Government gave The Asian Development Bank $350,000,000 at 1% with 40 years to repay. Surely when the Government can lend our money at these rates similar loans could be made available to people like ourselves and other Primary Producers who are in the position they are in through no fault of their own.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our involvement with the farming community from Queensland to Southern NSW gives us an insight into the deterioration in the financial situation of the farming community over the past 10 years and we have seen a number of these people have been forced off their properties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is imperative that the Federal Government move to stop the decline if they want a farming community at all. I personally spend an average of more than six months per year away from my family in order to try to earn an income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be appreciated if you would make this representation to Senator Collins and the Government on our behalf. At present we are the forgotten ones.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours sincerely</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Donald J Gray</PARA>
<PARA>I raise this issue tonight in the adjournment debate because small business people who are closely associated with and rely entirely on the primary production sector of this nation are also in dire straits as a result of the drought and deserve the serious attention of the government. I urge the government to give the circumstances such as those presented in this letter by Mr Don Gray further consideration to try to salvage those businesses so that they will exist to serve the farming community as we come out on the other side of this drought. </PARA>

The case that I refer to is obviously of greater importance; the headline is `Case dismissed'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Building Industry Task Force has gone to great pains to take criminal action against these unionists for doing what was no less than their duty as upstanding unionists within our community. They were in the process of trying to stop rorts and illegal behaviour on behalf of contractors at the Bombo sewage treatment plant in September 1992.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically the magistrate dismissed the charges, although technically he found the two men guilty. That speaks volumes about the way in which the Building Industry Task Force took criminal action against these people.

Mr Dalgleish, who is the head of the Building Industry Task Force, commented that the costs of prosecuting Mr Matters and Mr Hilton were under $50,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems quite amazing to me that the New South Wales government has $50,000 to spare&mdash;and that is a conservative estimate, I would suggest. Our estimate would put it somewhat higher than that, if we take into account the work that was done in the background by people not directly related to the court case&mdash;those who carried out the investigation; the spivs and the others who were sniffing around the community to find people who would stand up and declare Mr Matters and Mr Hilton criminals. They could not find those people, and there was a reason they could not find those people&mdash;both those gentlemen were supported, in the main, by the total community. For the record of the House, those men were charged with watching and besetting. As I understand it, such charges have not been taken out against unionists since 1927. I could be proven incorrect on that but, as I understand it, 1927 was the last time those criminal charges were laid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This case brings forth a major victory to the union movement. It shows the New South Wales government that it is inappropriate to take criminal action against union officials who are engaged in the duties of their union and who are, to the best intents and purposes, trying to protect the rights of their members. I have a great deal of pride in suggesting that both Neville Hilton and Paul Matters are people I respect and revere for the work they have done within our community. They have the total support of the union movement on the south coast because they have been prepared to stand up and be counted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Fahey and the New South Wales government, who will not be in office much longer, should take a real good look at what they have done. The bottom line is that these findings suggest to us that these unionists did what they could for their membership. Four of the five charges were thrown out. They were technically found guilty of the other charge but no record has been laid; and this is all for $50,000 of New South Wales taxpayers' money. When people on that side of the House start talking about wasting taxpayers' money, perhaps they should look at some of their colleagues in New South Wales. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a very serious matter this evening&mdash;the quality of water in Australia, particularly in the area of Bendigo, which I represent. Just this week, one of the reservoirs which supplies drinking water to the city of greater Bendigo was removed from the supply system due to algal contamination. Fortunately, that contamination was detected before it reached the toxic stage. I have raised this issue in the House on a previous occasion, and there has been very little government action as a result of the complaints I registered at that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government must realise that it is of vital importance to put money and effort into carrying out research into the prevalence of toxic growth in waterways and tributaries throughout Australia which are affected by this complaint. I flew into Canberra early Sunday afternoon and I was quite devastated to see the condition of some of the waterways around Canberra. There is a similar situation in Victoria because the drought has moved from the northern part of Australia down through New South Wales, and has now extended right down to the Great Dividing Range in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) is at the table taking notes on this issue. The government will be aware of this problem, and the problem will continue. The government has neglected to provide water and sewage treatment works to many rural townships throughout my area. Ultimately the outflow, or effluent, from those systems finds its way into many tributaries which eventually lead into the Murray-Darling system and pollutes watercourses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has tried to hide this problem over a number of years. The problem has continued over the past three or four years and the recent hot weather in Victoria and other parts of Australia has contributed to this problem. Algal growth is a serious matter; it is one that the government has not applied itself to, and it is one that will continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to use scare tactics or the like, but the fact that we have these problems is of concern to a number of rural communities. I know that the Coliban Water district, which is in charge of the water supply for the Bendigo area, is watching this situation very carefully. Its senior scientist, Mr Peter Fyffe, said that the algal chemical used acts quickly to kill the algae. What is required is greater research effort and greater effort by the government to ensure that rural towns and townships do have a proper water supply and proper effluent disposal. It is all very well to use the best efforts of Coliban Water to contain the chemical at the stage of contamination, but there needs to be proper research into this problem to work out exactly what is required in order to get on top of it. It is not as though this has happened just in this season; it has been ongoing for a number of years. I do not think the government has responded positively to the issues that I raised last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem has not diminished; in fact, it is escalating and it will continue to escalate, particularly while Australia is in the grip of these current drought conditions.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YU5">Mr TANNER</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Melbourne)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (7.42 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to raise a major problem which has come to a head in my electorate: the relocation of the Salvation Army Gill Memorial Home. The federal and state governments and the Salvation Army have been committed for a number of years to relocating the Gill Memorial Home. The current facility is now quite inappropriate for the care of crisis homeless people in particular. There is no question that it is an important priority for the government to be able to relocate the facility. Unfortunately, the initial choice for a new location, the old Pastoral Hotel site on Racecourse Road in Flemington in my electorate, after about three years of haggling in the planning process, ended up not being able to be proceeded with. This was because of the discovery very late in the day that it was a prohibited use under the planning scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following that, the state government, without any consultation with local residents and without any planning process at all, then provided a site in West Melbourne, the former West Melbourne Primary School, for use for the purpose. In doing so, the state minister for planning acted in such a way as to remove all rights to appeal against the rezoning that was necessary and, effectively, removed the ability of local residents to object in any way to the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is well known that any facility of this nature will attract objections from local residents, wherever it is proposed to be located. Therefore, the Salvation Army's position is an understandable one; it has waited for a number of years to be able to relocate the facility. There is strong pressure from both governments to get moving&mdash;and quite rightly so. Having been through the experience with the planning process with respect to the original site, the Salvation Army's desire to get moving is understandable. Unfortunately, the state government, by acting in the way it has, by removing the right of local residents to have their day in court, has created a highly volatile situation. There are now very substantial protests by local residents who are concerned about the potential impact the new facility may have on their quality of life. It is going to be located very close&mdash;in fact, Mr Speaker, closer than you are from me&mdash;to a substantial street of residences in the West Melbourne-North Melbourne area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is impossible to assess precisely how strong and valid the fears are without a proper planning process. The tragedy of the situation is that people have not been given the opportunity to have their arguments tested in the usual independent planning tribunal process. It concerns me that, if the proposal does go ahead in its current form, it will be very difficult for the new Gill Memorial Home to integrate into the community in the way that it should and to have the support of the local community surrounding it. However, if there were a proper planning process and that process determined that the project would proceed, in my view the local residents would accept the outcome even if they felt it was unfavourable to them because at least they would have had the opportunity to put their arguments and to have them assessed in an independent way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government does have an involvement in this issue through providing a very substantial part of the funding but, because of the structure of the arrangement, is effectively unable to make any change in the situation. The Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe) has made representations to the state minister indicating concern about the way in which the planning process has been abrogated. But, because this is occurring under the Commonwealth-state housing agreement and the inner city hostel redevelopment fund, with the money having already been paid to the Salvation Army and part of it having already been expended, there is clearly no way that the federal government can intervene to change things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that in some way the Salvation Army and the state government, with the assistance of the federal government, can come to some alternative arrangement. There is a possible alternative site nearby which most local residents, but not all, seem to be happy with: an Australia Post site. There are some complications with pursuing that option. It would be appropriate if all involved could sit down and try to work towards that as a better alternative, so that the interests of the Salvation Army, the people this facility is assisting and also the local community can be met. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already spoken recently in this House about one aspect of the drought: the wonderful generosity and compassion that have been raised and demonstrated throughout the Australian community for farmers afflicted by drought. I have already spoken about the work of the Coffs Harbour City Rotary Club in raising money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly concerned now about an issue that has been raised with me by the Woolgoolga Lions Club. That club is involved with raising money in Woolgoolga, a very pretty seaside town in the northern part of my electorate, to assist with the drought relief project. It is working in concert with the Lions Club in Timboon, an area in north-eastern Victoria with a population totalling only about 850. The Lions Club of Timboon has organised truckloads of fodder to be sent to north-west New South Wales and south-east Queensland. I understand that so far about 60 truckloads of fodder have already been delivered. The fodder has been donated; the trucks and the drivers have been volunteered; and the fuel, initially, was provided by Shell Australia&mdash;and I compliment Shell for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Timboon still has fodder available to be sent to the drought stricken areas and trucks and drivers prepared to shift it. But regrettably, because of the high cost of fuel, the oil company cannot continue to donate the fuel. The members of the Lions Club of Woolgoolga have gone out of their way to try to help. They have raised over $3,000 in five days and hope to double that within the next fortnight. Unfortunately, approximately half the money they have raised will disappear in the fuel excise levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the federal government is concerned about the drought. I want to make the strongest possible suggestion to the government: it should rebate the fuel excise levy which is, let us face it, about 35c a litre&mdash;approximately half the cost of the fuel involved in transporting the fodder. This would be a very sensible, realistic and reasonable way for the government to further assist in this matter. The New South Wales government has a fodder transport subsidy. This is an easy way for the federal government to come to the party on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Lions Club of Woolgoolga is made up of a great team of fellows who are led by their President, Allan Smith, and their Secretary, Neil Currall. They wrote to me and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Garry, we are asking your urgent assistance, to persuade Parliament, to have the fuel taxes exempted, from the fuel used, in these trucks, which are part of a most worthy cause, as we are helping the Government, to help the people in need and not to raise money for the Taxation Department.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a valid point. Last week I mentioned that Caltex provided $8,000 to fund a convoy of hay to Walcha. Shell paid the fuel bill from Victoria to Texas in Queensland. Ampol provided $2,000 for 12 tankers to deliver water around the Glen Innes area. These companies have a limit on how much they can give. But the reality is that, if the government could rebate the fuel excise levy, twice the amount of cartage could be provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point I want to make concerns some pig farmers in my electorate at Millbank on the upper Macleay. It is three or four years since there was enough rain to make their gullies run. There is no flow in the springs to feed the creeks. There is still some underground flow and water in some holes, so there is a little water. Their concern for their 1,500 pigs is the supply of feed, the supply of grain. A year ago they paid $100 a tonne for wheat. Three months ago it had gone up to $160 a tonne. Now it is $258 a tonne ex the farm gate over in the west. Grain is very hard to get. They have got a few cattle but they are not overstocked. They have to maintain their breeding stock and they put a lot of effort into it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are concerned, as so many farmers are, about where the feed is going to come from to keep their stock alive, particularly in an intensive area such as pig farming. It is not just the cost of the money, which is quite incredible the way the prices have gone up; it is the availability of the feed. We should remember that if there is no feed, there are no pigs, there is no business, there are no taxes, and there is no food for the rest of us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Most members would be aware by now that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) has launched the energy card, which will create facilities for low interest financing for the purchase of environmentally friendly, renewable energy technologies and energy efficient measures. Basically, this card will allow consumers who wish to purchase goods&mdash;such as solar hot water systems and other energy efficient and cost saving devices&mdash;to charge these items to a low interest credit card. The average household on a family budget can now afford to purchase these goods immediately and start saving money and the environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly enough, an idea similar to this was proposed in 1991 by the East Maitland branch of the CWA in the electorate of Paterson. It proposed a resolution `to approach the relevant government bodies to remove the sales tax on energy appliances that reduce the reliance upon non-replaceable fossil fuels'. The East Maitland branch of the CWA was calling upon the government to take a responsible lead in fostering better energy usage and energy saving products by making these goods more attainable to households. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now it can be seen that the two proposals are indeed similar. In fact, in many ways, they both propose the same objectives: environmental concern and care; cutting costs for people who would like to save energy and fossil fuels; reducing fossil fuel consumption; and making it easier for the average household to obtain energy saving devices and therefore reduce living costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CWA is a community based organisation that was formed in 1922. Previously, Dr Arthur, then the minister for health, called upon the community to create a social outlet for isolated women in the country. The support of this movement snowballed, and on 26 April 1922 the first CWA meeting was held at Crookwell. Since then the CWA has been the voice for the country and now, increasingly, for all women and members of the public. The organisation played important roles, from making sheepskin gloves for fighter pilots in World War II to building its own hospitals and, most importantly and basically, helping rural families and the women that formed the many branches throughout our nation. The CWA often put forward resolutions which were later taken up by various governments. It has increased community care and support for the flying doctors. Only the weekend before last, we saw the magnificent response of the whole of Australia to support the Royal Flying Doctor Service. In addition, many other services have been initiated by members of the CWA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Community groups such as the CWA play an important role in their own local community. Yet, as this example shows, it can also be seen that they often have a far greater influence than simply supporting their own community. Indeed, in this example, we have seen that it has probably caused changes to a national policy. It is not definite where the idea of the energy card originated, but community pressure does appear to have given at least one direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that community groups, such as the CWA, continue to put forward their ideas because, as honourable members have heard this evening, grassroots organisations do have their ideas acted upon. I commend the East Maitland branch of the Country Women's Association for its constructive participation in its community, and I urge it to keep it up. Well done!</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Halls Gap is not only an extremely pleasant area in which to live but also a thriving tourist destination. The inability to access television is impacting on the region's tourism capabilities. I experienced that first hand on Saturday, 1 October, the day of the AFL grand final, when I had the great honour to open the Halls Gap wildflower exhibition. After the opening, I was having a cup of coffee in the restaurant of a local motel with representatives of the Halls Gap Progress and Tourist Association when a family booked in, went down to their room, ascertained that they were unable to access the television and promptly checked out. This was at 11 o'clock in the morning, and they were the third group in one motel alone that had done so. It is not just on grand final day that this practice occurs. Apart from the obvious impact that it has on the region's tourism, it denies the rights of the permanent Halls Gap population to access television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I advised the House last week that, when we are talking about the information super highway, we must not leave behind many people in rural Australia, some of whom cannot even access something as basic as commercial television.

They are unable to access things that metropolitan Australians take for granted, such as the telecast of the Barcelona Olympic Games, which was denied them. The problems associated with this are no better indicated than in a letter to me from the Halls Gap Progress and Tourist Association dated 20 July.
