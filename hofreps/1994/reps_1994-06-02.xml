<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the following bills be referred to the Main Committee on Wednesday, 8 June 1994 and Thursday, 9 June 1994 for the second reading and consideration in detail stages:</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry, Science and Technology Legislation Amendment Bill 1994</PARA>
<PARA>These are the first bills that the House will be referring to the Main Committee. In accordance with the standing orders and the agreements we have on them, the opposition has looked at the list of bills that the government has submitted to it and has agreed that the bills are suitable for referral to the Main Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These bills will test all of us because at least one of them has some government amendments. We will test the mechanism whereby, if there is no agreement, we can bounce a bill back to the House of Representatives chamber. Some of these bills are time specific so there is also a useful mechanism there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just outline to the House a couple of things on the way the government intends to have the Main Committee work. If honourable members opposite have any suggestions, we are happy to hear them. Some weeks ago we accepted that `take note' motions would be dealt with in the Main Committee&mdash;that is, motions to take note of committee reports and papers that have already been presented to the House. We have not included any of those on the list for the next sitting week, but if members of either the government or the opposition have a particular committee report or paper that they want put on that list the government is happy to facilitate that. Of course, they will take secondary running to legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the government's intention that on each sitting Thursday at this time we will put forward a proposition that certain bills go to the Main Committee. We will negotiate a list of bills with the opposition in the days before. It is our intention that, in general, the Main Committee will meet on Wednesdays and Thursdays between the hours of 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. If there is an additional legislation load, we will extend the hours. We would not envisage the committee ever meeting on a Monday or on a Tuesday before 5 o'clock&mdash;that is, after the MPI. So on a Tuesday the Main Committee could probably sit for another 2 1/2-odd hours at the most. As we get towards the end of a session and other legislation needs to be dealt with, or if honourable members have other matters to be discussed with the `take notes', we could run it close to 3 p.m. or after the MPI on Wednesdays and Thursdays. The government believes this will relieve some of the pressure on the House for legislation and will give members a better chance to make contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter I might just mention is the way that the government intends to run a duty roster in the Main Committee. I am interested to hear whether the opposition has any comments on the matter. As members are aware, bills that go to the Main Committee will have their second reading there. So the minister or parliamentary secretary who has carriage of that bill will make the second reading speech there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government envisages that, at the beginning of the day, the duty person will either be a minister or a parliamentary secretary; it will most likely be a parliamentary secretary. At the end of legislation, either the minister will have carriage of the bill or a parliamentary secretary designated by that minister will accept amendments or give a definitive view of the government about the final outcome of that bill. Because of the pressure on ministers, particularly cabinet ministers, with chamber duty here and ministerial duty, as was foreshadowed by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) in the last sitting week, the government intends that some of the government duty will be done by people who are chairpersons of House of Representatives standing committees. </PARA>

The reason we chose those people is that they tend to be senior members of the place and have some knowledge of procedure, having dealt with those committees. We envisage that there will be a mix of those people doing it. Perhaps the opposition wants to consider whether it will use deputy chairpersons of committees if it has the same time constraints on frontbenchers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will finish there. I commend the motion to the House. This Main Committee will provide some useful work for both the parliament and members. In particular, I advise members who may wish to have any particular `take notes' put on the list that, wherever possible, we will facilitate that. So committees in particular will be able to get a little more discussion on their matters. People who have been on delegations might also be able to have more discussion on delegation reports which often in this place only get five or 10 minutes at the moment. I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I endorse the comments of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). I think the government is showing an exquisite sense of timing in introducing the Main Committee proceedings at a time when we are curtailing debate on the appropriations going into the consideration stage and then seeing the guillotine introduced next week. However, we are prepared and happy to embrace the operation of the Main Committee. We see nothing but good coming from it. It enables more controversial legislation to receive enhanced and ongoing debate in this chamber. Notwithstanding the aspirations to have non-controversial legislation go through the Main Committee, it is entirely probable, once we have settled down into the routine, that some of the debates in the Main Committee will see some controversial elements emerge. Not the least of those debates will be the debate coming up in the very short term on the South Australian banking inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the opposition, I am delighted to announce some additional appointments as a consequence of the introduction of the Main Committee. We thank the government for its initiative in making an offer to us that will enable us to address our responsibilities and orchestrate the administration of the chambers. I will become the Chief Opposition Whip. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) will become the Opposition Whip. The honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) will become the Deputy Opposition Whip. The honourable member for Riverina (Mr Hicks) will become the National Party Whip. The honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) will become the Deputy National Party Whip. The honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) will become the Assistant National Party Whip in the second chamber. The honourable member for McPherson will become the Opposition Whip for the Main Committee. We look forward with some excitement to the way the new chamber will function. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly to the points raised, accurately, by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and the Chief Opposition Whip, the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson), regarding a point I raised in correspondence with you, Mr Speaker. It was a concern and a suggestion that the Main Committee, or second chamber, could be used in place of the House of Representatives in that call back period arising from the Senate amending action late in either the autumn sittings or the spring sittings, as the case may be. I want to place on record that it is my understanding that that now cannot be the case in any way, shape or form. For the Main Committee to meet, the House of Representatives itself must also be meeting&mdash;that is, it must be in session, and it must actually be in session on the day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have one query arising from that. Because of the nature of that very last day of a sitting, when quite often we are still waiting for something to come back&mdash;and at the end of last year I recall we ended up sitting on a Saturday&mdash;does that definition mean that, on the same day, the House of Representatives could adjourn but the second committee could stay about for the rest of that day, or is it an absolute that the mace must be on the table and the House must be in actual session in terms of that interpretation of that aspect of the new standing orders that now provides for the operation of this new Main Committee and second chamber? I think it is important that that be finally and firmly clarified. We do not want to see any diminution of the proper role of the House of Representatives, especially with regard to matters controversial arising out of Senate deliberation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a couple of remarks because of my interest in the creation of the second chamber as a member of the Standing Committee on Procedure. I support and reiterate some of the concerns shared by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson). In particular, following on from the criticisms of me and the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), who were the dissenting reporters in the report that led to the creation of the second chamber, the second chamber may well demean the standard, or quality, or standing of the debate in the second chamber, and in particular the activities of the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly concerned by three features. One is the fact that there is no formality at the commencement of the Main Committee's proceedings. The second is the fact that we did not get the main committee room as the site for the Main Committee. I think that was unfortunate. What the procedure committee had in mind during its deliberations, as the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) would know, was that it would be seen as a substantial place in which members of the House of Representatives could debate bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third aspect is that we will see chairmen of standing committees leading the bills through the Main Committee. That to me is a disappointment because it suggests that already the government is conceding that its frontbench members and its parliamentary secretaries will be far too busy to be occupying themselves with the activities of the Main Committee. As we know, the intent was not to consider the debate of the legislation as somehow second class; it was merely to allow members the opportunity to debate non-contentious legislation in that second chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not entirely sure, and perhaps the honourable member for Watson can enlighten us, how the sitting hours of the Main Committee are actually going to work. I envisaged that the Main Committee would be sitting longer during the day, not just for short periods. Perhaps he could also enlighten us on whether in the future he would envisage the second chamber sitting for longer periods when the House of Representatives itself is sitting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very significant change for the procedures of the House of Representatives. The honourable member for Watson probably made a little bit of history at the dispatch box when he, in his capacity as the Chief Government Whip, made the first announcement of the bills that are to be referred to the Main Committee. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A concern that was shared by members of the committee at the time when we discussed this matter in the first instance was that the Main Committee in the House of Commons has not been an outstanding success. I have spoken to members of the House of Commons, particularly opposition members, and they think it is a failure. We ought to be concerned and vigilant to ensure that this second chamber does not become the means by which the government can demean or undermine the standing of debate in the House of Representatives, as has already occurred over its period of government. In the struggle between the executive and the parliament we have seen quite conclusively that the executive considers debate here to be utterly irrelevant. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4I4">Mr LEO McLEAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say that in a humorous manner. If there is any diminution of the role of the House of Representatives by the operation of the Main Committee, it would be not just the fault of the government but the fault of the opposition because the government has been very careful in constructing the standing orders that deal with the business that will go to this committee. The only matters that will go to the Main Committee are matters on which we reach agreement with the opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Moore might recall that one proposal put to the Standing Committee on Procedure was that the government should just decide on a list of bills. He might also recall that I was the person who said to the committee that, if this was going to work correctly, we would have to ensure that the opposition had a nearly absolute veto. We have said that we will seek the agreement of the opposition prior to putting up these lists, and I did that last week and I intend to do that in the future. So the opposition will have much more of a say in the running of that chamber than it does in this one. Rather than being a diminution of the way this chamber works, the Main Committee may set some example for this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) asked whether we will have prayers at the commencement of the Main Committee hearings. That was not provided for in the standing orders. No doubt, if he wishes to pursue that, he could discuss that with the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) or the Speaker. I do not think the government has any firm view on that one way or the other. But that is a matter that could be considered by others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason we are using 2R3 rather than the main committee room is a matter that was raised by the clerks. I think it was a sensible decision. It was one of those issues where my heart said that they were wrong but my head said that they were right. I think the main committee room might have been a better venue, but the difficulty with the main committee room is that this chamber does not have control over the main committee room. The main committee room is shared by us and the Senate. It would probably be quite wrong for us to conduct our business in a legislative form in an area that we do not have complete control over. So that is why we have moved the venue to 2R3. But 2R3 has been set up in a way that I do not think anyone could call second rate or third rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) raised a question as to whether we could use the Main Committee as a call back chamber. A simple reading of the standing orders shows that that is not possible. Even if the government found some mechanism to keep the Main Committee sitting when this chamber was not&mdash;and there is no mechanism, but even if by some trickery it managed to do it&mdash;it would do it no good. All we can conduct in the Main Committee is the second reading debate. The third reading has to be done in this chamber. So it is no good just having a second reading debate because we cannot complete our business without a third reading resolution. So there is absolutely no chance that the Main Committee could be used for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the standing orders' direction and the government's intent that the Main Committee will meet only when this chamber is in session. We will not have it sitting at times when there are matters of other significance in this chamber. This chamber is pre-eminent to this country, and the Main Committee will not be in competition with that in any way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the National Party whips. I see that the National Party, as usual, is trying to extend the envelope a little bit by having three whips for 13 or 14 members. The honourable member for Bennelong would know better than I as to how many the National Party has. The government's offer to the opposition was that we would put up a submission to the Remuneration Tribunal to fund a chief opposition whip and two other whips. I understand from the opposition that the National Party will get one and that the Liberal Party will get the other. So, in effect, we would be putting up the proposal for the positions of the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) and the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) to be improved. Someone from the National Party may be able to tell me which one of the two National Party assistant whips we want to improve, but I doubt whether we will offer to improve both of them. We may get some advice on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last matter I will address is the question raised by the honourable member for Bennelong and alluded to by the Chief Opposition Whip&mdash;that is, what those opposite think is an irony&mdash;that on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> today we have a guillotine on the appropriation bills and another budget related bill. Of course, what the honourable member for Bennelong would know, and others should know, is that there are a number of bills that must receive royal assent by 30 June and they are related to the budget bills. If those bills are to receive royal assent by 30 June, they have to be dealt with by the Senate and, if they originated in this chamber, they have to come back here before 30 June. That means that we have to get them dealt with in the next few sitting weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a pressure which has been put on us by the fact that we changed the date of the budget, not by any of the workings of this chamber or any other chamber&mdash;the fact that the budget now has bills that start not long after the budget is brought down rather than as occurred in the past when there was often about eight months between the budget being brought in and bills taking effect. Whether we like that or we do not, that is a decision that has been made and that drives the bringing in of some of these bills. So that is not a matter that I think is of any embarrassment to us in the operation of the Main Committee. It is a matter that is caused by the exigencies of having to meet those 30 June deadlines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I have covered all the issues which have been raised. I congratulate those honourable members of the opposition who will be handling these matters. It is good to see that good sense has taken over the opposition at last. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to be able to speak to Appropriation Bill (No. 1), which is one of the appropriation bills for the coming year. In doing so, I will make some remarks about both the budget and the Working Nation document that was presented earlier in May.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset it is important to note that the national account figures which came out yesterday confirm what was the strong claim of the government at the time of the presentation of the budget on 10 May: that our economy is now growing strongly and that the employment outlook is improving all the time. We have the confident prediction that we will be able to sustain the economic growth built upon low inflation and a comprehensive and deep recovery across all sections of the community. Yesterday's national account figures confirm how strong that position is for Australia and why the range of measures which were adopted in the budget provide the strategy to ensure that it is ongoing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting, when we look at both GDP and inflation, that there are various charts around this morning, one of which is in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, which highlight, in terms of OECD countries, just how strong our growth is. Last quarter's figures suggest five per cent, but even allowing for the real trend line of 4.3 per cent and inflation of 1.4 per cent, Australia is clearly right up there at the top of the league in terms of OECD countries' growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are achieving that growth sustainably with low inflation. That is particularly important because some have argued that we have a recovery going on but it is not a recovery of quality. The fact is that we have built that recovery over seven or eight quarters. Confidence is emerging all the time across all sections of the community, as we see with a variety of forecasts that are around at the moment. We can be confident, I believe, that the outlook for our growth, particularly as we integrate more strongly into the Asia region, is very positive indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is being achieved not only with the lowest inflation in 30 years and a low inflationary outlook but also with low levels of interest rates. It has been interesting to watch the debate that has gone on about interest rates. The opposition has done its level best over the past 2 1/2 years to try to talk down any prospects of economic recovery. In the last 18 months or so, there have been constant references to the fact that this was going to be a double dip recession. The former Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), repeatedly harangued us about this. Now we have a growth rate of five per cent of GDP. Clearly, those sorts of comments about a double dip recession have been proved to be absolutely nonsensical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comments have also been made about the level of the dollar. We have been told that we were forcing the pace too quickly with cuts in interest rates and so on over that period since February 1990 and that we would end up with a run on the dollar. When we look at the international outlook for Australia today, as reported in the media, we see that the world economic markets are making very positive judgments about Australia and our economic performance. I think they are displaying the confidence that the community is sharing, as the national accounts show. It is about time the opposition, instead of continually harping on the negative, as it is so inclined to do, started to recognise that a quality national recovery is emerging and that, as part of this year's budget, we have added to the foundation that was built into last year's budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this year's budget we have maintained&mdash;in fact, enhanced&mdash;the deficit reduction plan that was outlined last year. The deficit is on a downward trend. For 1994-95 it will be $11.7 billion, or 2 1/2 per cent of GDP, which is better than our predictions at budget time last year. We have also predicted that in the out years of 1996-97 we will get down to a deficit of 0.9 per cent of GDP. Again, that is an improvement on the around one per cent that was outlined by the former Treasurer last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition argues that our forecasts cannot be achieved. Last year it claimed that we were being overambitious in terms of forecasts. We know now that, instead of the deficit that we predicted at budget time last year, we have had substantial economic and jobs growth. It is clear that that process is continuing. Looking at the employment numbers over the last few months, there is absolutely no doubt that substantial growth in employment is occurring across all parts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is particularly important to note that the measures outlined in Working Nation are designed to provide the enhancement to that process to ensure that people get the opportunity to be part of the process of economic recovery. That is what the job compact arrangements and the youth training initiative are all about&mdash;ensuring that the recovery is shared by all Australians. We are concerned that we do not just have a recovery where the profit share rises substantially, as it has, and where some sections of the community benefit. We want to ensure that those people who have had an extended period out of the work force are able to get the training and skills to be able to rejoin the work force, along with other Australians, as more jobs become available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget and the Working Nation document have all of those things as their foundation. We recognise how important that skill and training component is in creating employment prospects for the community. We recognise that the government's continuing emphasis on the provision of resources, particularly for the long-term unemployed, is fundamentally important. Everybody knows that the recession has been very deep and severe. Some Australians have suffered through that process very severely indeed. We have a clear obligation to the long-term unemployed to ensure that they are embraced as part of the economic recovery. The white paper makes it particularly clear that that will be the government's No. 1 priority in 1994-95, and that is certainly an initiative I welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year's budget was historic in a number of respects. First of all, the fact that it was presented in May, before the next financial year to which it relates, represents an important change and, I think, a positive change for Australia. It will enable the whole community to be much more aware of the plan and projection for the full financial year. Hopefully, those who have an important part in making decisions about investment and priorities in ventures will be well aware of the government's priorities and public priorities over that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The general reaction to the budget this year has reflected the sense of confidence that exists in the community. The business community has been overwhelmingly positive in its reaction to the various parameters of the budget. Many prominent spokespersons for the business community have identified their confidence that the forecasts on business investment will be achieved as the recovery grows in momentum. I think we will see that occur very strongly in the next set of quarterly figures as well. Already expectations about business investment are improving substantially. We are now at a stage in the recovery where the profit share has moved up and where business will be utilising its full capacity. As that capacity utilisation reaches optimum levels, investment will start to take place in new plant and equipment and employment will be generated as a result. Those things are reflected in regions like western Sydney, which the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) and I represent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we maintain that focus on areas of manufacturing which have been performing strongly recently. In the export of manufactured goods there has been strong growth now for some 15 to 16 months. We can maintain and improve on that. The areas of strong economic activity and growing dynamism in our export opportunity and export performance will drive the new business investment that is one of the key elements built into the strategy outlined in this year's budget by the Treasurer (Mr Willis). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other key ingredients of this year's budget again reflect the fact that the government is not relying on growth alone to meet all the needs that exist in the community. Our budget is focused very much on our ongoing needs and social justice obligations. I am particularly pleased to see the initiatives we are taking in the area of mental health care, in the area of women's health&mdash;particularly in the breast cancer area&mdash;in the area of Aboriginal health and in regard to the broader Aboriginal issues of the establishment of the land fund. I notice that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) is here. I pay tribute to him and to all those who have played a part in ensuring that the reconciliation process and real justice for Aboriginal people are given the right priority, as it is with the establishment of the land fund and the range of other measures that are outlined in this year's budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also pleased to see that our industry and regional development programs are focusing on where the new opportunities will arise in the next few years, where the new chances will be to improve our industry, to increase competitiveness and to expand the manufacturing sector. There is no more fundamental aspect of that than ensuring that the small to medium sized enterprises identified by McKinsey's work are given the opportunity to get the capital and finance they need and to have long-term planning structures in place and the support of government in terms of their opportunity to access export markets and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the range of measures outlined in the industry component of Working Nation, particularly those related to access to finance, to the utilisation of the pooled development funds, to the extension of the export market development grants programs and initiatives of that sort, is fundamental to giving the small to medium sized enterprises across Australia those sorts of opportunities. McKinseys rightly identify just how crucial those types of enterprises will be to Australia's future economic performance. The jobs growth that we are predicting will be built upon those small to medium sized enterprises growing both in their domestic operations and moving out and forging anew into the markets in the Asia Pacific region, in particular. In my electorate of Parramatta we have had great success with the establishment of the export centre, which is a joint initiative on the part of Austrade, the Chamber of Manufactures of New South Wales and a host of other companies. They have joined together to form this one-stop shop for exporters from western Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has proved to be a phenomenal success. I am very pleased that this model has been picked up by the government and is going to be spread more broadly across Australia. It will embrace the opportunity for small business to gain access to both expertise and skills in order to plan their export drive and, equally, be able to utilise the opportunities that exist particularly around Asia and to link in with the Austrade officers and representatives in that region and in a cost-effective way get access to those new opportunities and new market potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are the sorts of initiatives that our industry statement has ensured will be very much enhanced. It is critical that we keep building on those types of initiatives as time goes on. I am very confident that the strategy outlined by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) will enable that to occur. In the area of regional development, there was an important initiative in the Working Nation statement relating to the fast tracking of the Badgerys Creek airport&mdash;a very important initiative for Parramatta and the western Sydney region. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6T4">Mr ELLIOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Chifley said, this is the best news for our region for years. That is quite true. The jobs multiplier effect for western Sydney of the fast tracking of the Badgerys Creek airport will be enormous. It is critical that it not be the sort of proposal that the FAC has been talking about of a 1,800-metre runway. A full internationally competitive runway facility needs to be built there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that the private sector will be very enthusiastic about investing both in Badgerys Creek and the infrastructure associated with it as a result of the government showing its commitment through the Working Nation statement and the enhancement and attractiveness of infrastructure bonds that have been included in that process. I am confident that the new airport facility at Badgerys Creek will generate many thousands of jobs as it comes on stream towards the end of this century. I am very confident that the new investment in the freight area, manufacturing and so on will be enormous in western Sydney into the next century. I warmly congratulate the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) and the government on initiating this very important project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I briefly touch on a couple of other matters contained in the budget and outline how they affect my region. In particular, I welcome the fact that there is an ongoing commitment to solving the significant flood mitigation and urban flooding problems that exist in the Parramatta River catchment. I am pleased that funding has continued for that. Homes are now being made flood free after years of concern and risk and, in some cases, inundation in floods over recent years. It is very pleasing that the government has maintained and enhanced its commitment to that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the fact that the projects funded as part of the One Nation statement are now coming to fruition. I am pleased to note that we have just opened the new tourist centre in Parramatta which was funded in large measure by the government. I am pleased that we have maintained our ongoing commitment to Parramatta Park with the restoration of the dairy cottage in that park. The government's commitment to heritage items like Parramatta Park is well demonstrated. It is a pity that we cannot get a commitment from the New South Wales government to at least match the funding contribution we are making so that Parramatta Park can have its rightful significance. This is unfortunately being denied by the New South Wales Liberal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased to support this year's budget. It is a very welcome and positive contribution to our economic recovery. I have no doubt new jobs will flow as a result of the budget measures. The national accounts highlight how strong and resilient the recovery is in Australia. I certainly welcome the fact that the government is determined to maintain during the recovery a commitment to all elements of the community and make it a recovery not for the few but for all to share in and reap the benefits of. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer (Mr Willis) is to be congratulated on this year's budget in comparison with last year's political disaster. I think his claims that the budget will maximise growth, assist unemployment, promote social justice, reduce the deficit and not introduce any taxes are certainly exaggerated. However, it must be admitted there is some truth in what he is saying. The community has generally responded with a muted acceptance of the budget. Nevertheless, I think the overall framework of the budget continues down the well-worn path of Thatcherism, Reaganism and economic rationalism. The budget reduces taxation, increases privatisation and asset selling and reduces infrastructure spending but ignores debt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well for the government to heap scorn on the feral abacuses on the coalition side and the Darwinism of the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), but the philosophical framework of this budget is really very little different except that it is couched in traditional Labor rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not matter how much one manipulates the statistics; the fact is that the difference between the incomes of the rich and poor is widening all the time. Today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> points out that Australia has the widest difference between the upper and lower incomes in the OECD. Progressive taxation systems are but a distant memory. The quality of education and the quality of health care in this country depend purely on the wealth of the individual concerned. The export of productive jobs in this country is continuing apace. Nobody is predicting unemployment at any really acceptable levels for the rest of this decade. Nobody is talking about public debt, which is continuing. Foreign ownership is increasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For most of this century, the Labor Party has been the progressive party of Australian politics. It has been the party of ideas, and conservative parties have tended to follow on behind. But since the late 1970s there is no question that the initiative has moved to the extreme right of the political spectrum and Labor has simply followed, reluctantly in some aspects. It has tried to cloak its embarrassment with a mantra of social justice, but this budget follows exactly along this road. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) endlessly boasts that we now have the lowest tax and the lowest outlays in the OECD. Certainly that is true. There is no question that he has earned a Milton Friedman medal, but we really have to ask what sort of society we want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget is really pleasing business and the upper income groups, but we have to recognise that Australia has large comparative disadvantages with other countries. It has the inefficiencies of space and distance. We need to spend more on infrastructure than other countries do. We have had the fastest population growth in the OECD over the last half century, and that adds to the need for more infrastructure spending. Yet, since comparative records have been kept, since about 1960, infrastructure spending as a percentage of GDP has steadily fallen in real terms. It was about eight or nine per cent of GDP and now it is down to about five or six per cent. Just for this year that is a $12 billion shortfall. That is clearly shown in the tables on page 6.17 of Budget Paper No. 1. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no question that the states, which have been the traditional providers of infrastructure, have a legitimate complaint, because they have been bearing the brunt of the reduction in government outlays over the years. In fact, since 1983 it is true that the states have lost $3.7 billion per annum through cuts from the Commonwealth. In turn, of course, the states have also been indulging in asset selling and reduced infrastructure spending. Perhaps it is not surprising that only local government seems to be free of this disease. That is probably because it is closer to the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any sensible person in this country knows that the worst thing you can do is sell your assets. I think everyone can see the net results of this. One does not have to look at all the tables and statistics; one has only to look at the urban areas of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane to see the deteriorating infrastructure and the failure to meet increasing demand. We can easily see the falling standards in water supply, sewerage and road systems. We can see that we are just living off the past. We cannot go on doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to recognise that there are greater needs in Australia. It is no good comparing us with Asian tigers that have almost no road infrastructure in comparison with Australia or even with other OECD countries. The United Kingdom has 22 kilometres of road per 1,000 cars. Germany has 19 kilometres per 1,000 cars. Even the USA has 49 kilometres per 1,000 cars. Australia has 104 kilometres of road per 1,000 cars. In the Asian tigers&mdash;places like Singapore, Taiwan and Japan&mdash;of course the figure is minuscule. It is the same with railways. Japan has one kilometre of railway per 10,000 people. The United Kingdom has three kilometres, France has six kilometres, the USA has 11 kilometres and Australia has 29 kilometres. That figure of 29 is now reduced because there is no way we are keeping up the infrastructure spending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In comparison to population, we have the longest set of roads in the world, the lowest fuel tax and the lowest general taxation; yet we wonder why we cannot meet demand and why roads are deteriorating. If we continue along this path, what sort of society will we end up with?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the major parties continue to go to each election and try to buy votes by lowering taxation, telling motorists they are soaked and ignoring the long-term consequences, we will fall further and further behind. We should look at what the Europeans did when they had massive shortfalls in infrastructure after the Second World War. They adopted a sensible road tax policy, and today they have fantastic roads and fantastic public transport systems. I am not suggesting that the price of fuel in Australia go up to European levels, but the community is not stupid. It is interesting that the Greiner government in New South Wales easily solved the problem with the 3 x 3 policy. If definite works are identified, the public will accept increases in taxation to pay for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget continues with the asset selling policy that we have followed for the last few years. If it were not for those asset sales and the Reserve Bank revenue, the real deficit of this budget would be $20 billion. I know the government would try to defend that by saying that the Commonwealth is to make capital outlays of over $1 billion in 1994-95 and that some of the $30 billion provided to assist the states and local government will go to infrastructure spending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget papers estimate that capital expenditure is about $3 billion. The government can also argue that the $2.4 billion of asset sales is exceeded by outlays this year. But that ignores the fact that the states' infrastructure spending is dramatically reducing in relation to the Commonwealth's. It also ignores the demands of the rising population and the demands of urban renewal, particularly in the large urban areas of Australia. It ignores the fact that eventually that policy must end, because we will simply run out of assets. We are getting close to that point now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Kelty report on regional development, with all its recommendations for infrastructure spending, was considered a joke by the economic rationalists of the Treasury. I think one of its recommendations should be taken seriously. That is, it is about time the Commonwealth set up its budget to show the difference between recurrent and capital accounts in our spending. This was also recommended by the FitzGerald national savings report. State governments and local government have always followed such a budgetary process. The cut in the infrastructure spending by the states and the increase by the Commonwealth have shown up the need for the Commonwealth to keep separate budget accounts to get some clarity into the process and to avoid the obfuscation we have now. While ever the government tries to use asset sales to bolster recurrent expenditure, as it is doing to some extent, it is on a path of madness. In my view, it is also quite irresponsible to use asset sales to reduce debts. That is little better, because it is short term and it does not address the causes of debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real time bomb of this budget is the public debt interest as a proportion of Commonwealth outlays. It is seven per cent in this budget; it was only 5.7 per cent last year. That is an increase of $1.9 billion. If interest rates rise&mdash;in spite of what has been said, they must eventually rise&mdash;this public debt will go out of control. Public assets built up over generations have in recent years been put out to public float, public tender, private tender, or cosy sale contracts as in the case of the gas pipeline. That has been done with little concern for the users of the services which those assets provide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to sell assets often ignores the problem that the business objectives of the new owners will conflict with the government's objectives when those assets were in public hands. The objectives that the government sets for its government business enterprises have community service obligations factored in to varying degrees. In part that results from a desire to maintain consistent service standards across the country and the practical difficulties that the GBEs would face in calculating and setting charges proportional to the cost of the service supply for each of their clients and consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the sale of a GBE asset, the interests of directors and shareholders become paramount. In theory, competition with other service suppliers is supposed to impose the rigours of market discipline. Consumers of such services are in theory protected from predatory pricing by such enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government asset sales are not capable of generating the best price and protecting the interests of service consumers simultaneously. In practice, the sale of a public asset frequently privatises a monopoly and confronts consumers with price rises unchecked by market competition. This is to a large degree inevitable, since any government move to sell an asset will have at least two mutually inconsistent aims. The first is to maximise the sale price, which is driven by short-term budgetary necessity. It is obviously short term if the privatised asset cannot be resold to repair future budgetary failings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maximising the sale price requires the public interest of consumers to be compromised by a structure that delivers subsidies, economic rent schemes or monopoly profits to the enterprise. Any serious, comprehensive effort to force competition and market discipline on the enterprise's pricing decisions will reduce the potential for profits to shareholders and fees to directors. Its short-term effect would be to depress the asset sale price, which compromises the immediate budgetary benefits and, worse, undersells an asset built up by the public, as taxpayers and consumers, over many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sale of public assets and the failure of governments to invest in infrastructure as our predecessors did will cause untold hardship for future generations, who will be left very little if the squandering of public assets and failure to maintain others are allowed to continue. </PARA>

I think the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) made a truthful point when he said that there is somewhat of a contrast between this budget and the last one. I am pleased to see that we are not going through the angst that we did a little less than 12 months ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) said, we ought to recognise the herculean task that has gone into this budget. We not only delivered a significant white paper on employment a couple of weeks before the budget&mdash;the last one being by the Chifley government in the 1940s&mdash;but also had the budget process and a budget brought forward. This must have been a telling and onerous task on the ministers involved as well as on a lot of public servants who underpinned the good work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I will run through a couple of features of the budget. Firstly, people like to know the size of the cake. It is $120,000 million or $120 billion, which is a lot of money. I am pleased to say that it is estimated that the budget deficit for 1993-94 will come in at $13.6 billion&mdash;$2.4 billion below the forecasts. In other words, the forecasts in the previous budget were very conservative. The estimate for the budget deficit in this budget is $11.7 billion. We are hoping in this budget to reduce the budget deficit as a percentage of GDP from 3.2 per cent in 1993-94 to 2.5 per cent in 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose that it is only on this side of the House that we can really talk about the prospect of balancing budgets or getting budgets back into surplus, which is something that the conservatives consistently fail to do. The figures in this budget predict a balanced budget in 1997-98 and, hopefully, a surplus from that point onwards. The budget forecasts a growth rate of five per cent. There was a lot of scepticism by some, particularly by the opposition, about that forecast and, particularly, the forecast of business investment growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is ironic for us to be speaking about the budget today when the papers are full of March quarter national accounts figures which show a GDP growth rate of five per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clearly, Australia is doing particularly well compared with other OECD countries. I hope we will continue in that phase. I think the acid test in electorates in the western suburbs of Sydney always will be what we are doing about unemployment. I am very pleased that the Working Nation document has broken some new ground. I stress that the best news that we will have for the long-term unemployed will come from the highest growth rates that we can get.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased that this budget and the Working Nation document set aside some $6.4 billion for our initiatives in trying to overcome Australia's high unemployment rate. I think people's understanding of unemployment is that in previous recessions&mdash;for example, the dreadful recession in 1961, when unemployment shot up by about 2.1 per cent and people were being laid off from firms and businesses&mdash;as the economy picked up, those people would be put back into employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen significant structural changes in the economy. After we picked up from the 1983-84 recession, only one in seven of the long-term unemployed was getting back into employment. I think part of the reason is that wasted or replaced jobs in the economy have been of the lower skill level. This has thrown up problems such as illiteracy in the workplace. Lower skilled jobs are disappearing and people are transferring into jobs that require greater skills, so some of these shortcomings are being shown. There is not the same number of unskilled jobs in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting example I like to quote is service stations. The number of service stations has dropped dramatically and the method of retailing has changed. Now we do not normally see a service station with a mechanic, a couple of apprentices and a panel beater. They have all been hived off into separate businesses. We certainly do not see any pump attendants any more. It used to be the way that many people got their first job experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overhang of long-term unemployment occurred in 1983-84. It is even more severe now, with the recession in the 1990s. That is why it is so important for the government to develop programs that train people and fit  them for the workplace so they are able to enter these jobs competitively, skilled up, and able to look forward to a much longer term future in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of revolutionary changes have occurred through the budget and the white paper. The first is the job compact, which is the commitment by the government to long-term unemployed people that they will receive sensitive and individual attention in trying to determine their special needs and ensuring that they get ongoing support. It includes the promise of a job for six to 12 months. Most of these jobs will occur in the private sector. I do not have any difficulty with CDEP programs or RED schemes, but these private sector jobs are about job preparation in real working environments of productive units and, of course, providing them with extensive training. Employers will be given financial encouragement to take on long-term unemployed people under the job compact. I sincerely hope that there will be many employers in the western suburbs of Sydney who, like the government and like everyone in the community, are happy to accept their social responsibility to assist long-term unemployed people. I am confident that they will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other significant factor is the change to the parenting allowance whereby as of 1 July 1995 spouses of people who are unemployed will get paid their unemployment benefit directly. It will split the unemployed benefit in half so that the spouse is paid directly. Secondly, if the unemployed person finds some work, that income will be treated individually, as a single person, rather than as a family unit. This is a very significant and radical change. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QI4">Mr PRICE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a great achievement, as the honourable member for Parramatta suggests, and it is one that I am sure will have a significant impact in the western suburbs of Sydney, which are typified by a much younger demographic profile than other parts of New South Wales. I trust that all honourable members, even my good friend the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), would welcome this as an important family initiative in the International Year of the Family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Parramatta, quite rightly, has drawn the attention of the House to the significant undertaking by the government of the Badgerys Creek international airport. I think it is fair to say that federal members from the western suburbs of Sydney can take some satisfaction in bashing away at this, together with the community and other interested people, to see this result. I do not want to deprecate&mdash;and nor did the honourable member for Parramatta&mdash;the magnificence of the decision by the government and by the minister. I want to associate myself with his remarks on it. I think he was being too modest to point out his own role in it and that of our fellow colleagues from the western suburbs of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can only speculate&mdash;and that will be curtailed only by our own imaginations&mdash;on the possible impact and catalytic effect that most of us believe this will have on the western suburbs of Sydney. We have so much going for us, not the least of which is the raw talents initiative of the people of the western suburbs of Sydney. Given the opportunity, we need to harness it. Once this airport is open, I think we will look back and say that this was a watershed event in the region. I strongly endorse it. I have no difficulty with the fact that this airport may very well be privately owned and run. I do not give a damn who owns it or who runs it, as long as it is in vicious competition with Kingsford Smith airport and it delivers the best opportunities for the western suburbs of Sydney. I am convinced it will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I may say something a little negative, I was disappointed about some of the industry measures in the budget, particularly the new Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) forswearing the sectoral policy approach that has served the government so well in a number of instances, which I have repeated on a number of occasions, such as the steel plan and the car plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My attention has been drawn to today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. In the area of communications we have an example of this Labor government taking, for us, the most difficult step of deregulating the industry&mdash;we did that with some angst but successfully&mdash;and developing a very comprehensive industry plan. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> today says that there are growth rates of up to nine per cent in this sector and it is the fastest growing sector within the economy. We can feel some satisfaction about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think we can come to grips with the needs of different sectors in the economy by taking a broad-brush approach or by assuming that, through some osmosis type process, information will drift through bureaucratic windows or ministerial windows. We actually have to get out there, talk to industry, get a feel for industry and then determine collectively what is best to be done. The point about people like me from electorates that have high unemployment is that we cannot afford to forswear any opportunity for growth in any sector. In other words, it is in the interests of my electors to see each sector in the economy performing to its optimum in generating long-term growth and long-term jobs. Communications has been an example. Notwithstanding the good work that has been done in a variety of sectors, I do not think that we have reached the end of the road here. I certainly hope that the minister will have a rethink about his approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last but not least, I was pleased to see that the Family Court is to get some more money. Members would be aware that I am pleased to chair the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues and that the additional money was a recommendation of its predecessor. After the tabling of the report into the child support scheme, I am very much looking forward to the inquiry into the funding and administration of the Family Court to see what we can do to ensure that the essential services that are provided by the court are most effectively and efficiently delivered to people. The more we can do and think about in this International Year of the Family to ensure that people are able to separate with dignity, to minimise trauma, to get on with their lives, and to ensure that adequate and sound provisions have been made for their children the better. I notice the honourable member for Menzies, who is a member of the committee, is in the House. I would like to acknowledge his contribution to the child support inquiry. I am sure we will benefit again from his contributions to the funding inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I strongly support the budget. We have had some very radical proposals in this budget that people in the Labor movement will be very proud of. If I have one hope about the budget it is that we have underestimated dramatically the growth in the economy and our potential to get the long-term unemployed figures well below five per cent by the year 2000. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset I am delighted to respond to the invitation from my colleague the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) about the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues inquiring into the child support scheme and to his wish that when that report is finalised and tabled in this place and elsewhere it leads to substantial improvements for many Australian families. Considerable concern has been expressed to the committee. We received more than 6,000 submissions&mdash;a record in the history of this parliament&mdash;and there were some 150,000 attempts or more to phone us on a special telephone hotline to complain and express concerns about aspects of the operation of the child support scheme. That I think indicates the level of concern which must be addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also delighted to respond to his invitation about the provisions relating to the splitting of benefits. The splitting of benefits reinforces, if not establishes, an important principle which may be taken from that measure: this government is prepared to say that benefits can be split between spouses and paid separately to both spouses. If that principle can apply on one side of the ledger to benefits, there is no reason why it ought not apply on the other side of the ledger to the raising of revenue through taxation in the first place. That actually does occur at the present time because I suspect there is no professional, no farmer and no small business operator on any sort of reasonable income in this country who does not effectively split income between himself or herself and a respective spouse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those left out of this equation tend to be those on PAYE tax who are not in an effective position to bring about that situation. It should be said that I am not advocating income splitting, as it is often simplistically described, in terms of husband and wife. Quite clearly, that has regressive elements. If we are willing to adopt the principle that there can be some recognition of family in this sense, it seems to me that there can be some greater recognition of family in the taxation system, whether or not some splitting of income is allowed in relation to the number of children a family has&mdash;which would apply equally to married couples and to sole parents&mdash;whether some different threshold in relation to responsibilities for children is allowed or whether some realistic parenting allowance is allowed. It does not really matter so much which mechanism is employed, but it seems to me that the consequence of what the honourable member is pointing out today in relation to benefits, and what we know in relation to those who are not on PAYE taxation, is that the principle of splitting or recognising the family in that way is well entrenched in the system and that those who miss out are the ordinary Australians on PAYE taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been led astray by my honourable friend because I want to speak today on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1994-95 about training, and vocational education and training in particular. For 10 years now this tired Labor government has ignored vocational education and training whilst it toiled to make the university system mass and, as a consequence, in many respects mediocre. Today it labours to spawn a new Orwellian monster out of the hereto neglected vocational education and training sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through agreements between the Commonwealth and the states, a new national and, in many regards, overly prescriptive system of vocational education and training is being imposed. The consequences for those who do not comply with the system&mdash;that is, the hapless employers in many cases&mdash;will be to deny them access to training subsidies and publicly funded entry level training. The cattle prods of compliance are all too numerous. There is the national framework for the recognition of training which includes requirements to comply with provider registration, course program accreditation, national training board endorsed standards and their predetermined Australian standards framework level, credit transfer, and program articulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the Australian vocational training certificate system which includes the absorption of existing apprenticeships and traineeships, structured on- and off-the-job vocational education and training, a national indenture system through contracts of training and compliance with the requirements of the national framework for recognition of training agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we start to look at vocational education and training&mdash;one is not understood unless one uses the acronyms in this area; I should refer to it as VET&mdash;we are talking about NFROT, ASF and AVTCS. The acronyms go on and on. The names alone give some indication of the layer upon layer of large tumour-like bureaucracy that is developing in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me indicate some of the industry reactions to the new centralist hell being created to curse industry while keeping the public servants industriously idle. In a report commissioned by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Western Australia, it is stated of the national training reform agenda, or NTRA, that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the past year to 18 months the feedback from our members in the business community on the direction the reform process has taken has been to say the least alarming. This feedback has come to a consensus view, (from the most ardent supporters of training reform) and the consensus is that training reform has been completely supplanted by the wages issue. By and large the debate taking place in IETCS (WA industry training advisory bodies) and national ITABS has focused on at what level a particular unit of competence should reside on the ASF level hierarchy; debates on the interpretation on ASF level descriptors as a means to setting the value of a particular job or task, and very little about the quality or facilitation of training.</PARA>
<PARA>So the industry training bodies are turning into de facto mini-wage negotiation forums. These forums are not properly constituted for that purpose and they are not representative. Employers who are genuinely interested in training look in vain for any focus on the purpose of training itself. The training system is being heavily bureaucratised from the top down in the name of national consistency. But national consistency is set to become another straitjacket to hold in business through new regulatory rigidities and a centrally driven funding regime which has little, if any, idea of local needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry has no problem with the need to maintain standards. That is accepted by all. If we are to be a productive economy, then standards must be maintained and even raised. But, if the interpretation of standards becomes narrow and prescriptive, it will inhibit the ability of firms to act out of their sole raison d'etre, which is to provide services or sell products. Businesses do not exist in the first place to pay wages. That is a by-product of their existence. If they are so tied about with ropes of regulatory mumbo jumbo, this does not merely not contribute to their ability to produce goods and services; it actively makes it increasingly difficult to trade at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the development of competency based training, or CBT, which is still purely theoretical in Australia, there is concern by industry groups that the fundamental reasons for training&mdash;the firm and productivity&mdash;are being ignored. The idea of competency based training is supposed to be that a firm identifies where workers are deficient. The firm then identifies the desired outcome of the required training which goes by the name of competencies. The firm then decides how best to meet these outcomes through training. Instead, what is happening is that competency based training is being interpreted as part of a national work value hierarchy which makes it no better than the occupationally time based system that it is intended to replace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the aim is apparently to have all workers' competencies registered and portable with a national skill value, a high degree of reliability is required. As assessment is mostly in the field or on the factory shop floor, there will have to be an extremely costly method of verification which will add nothing at all to the skills level of this country. In England, where a standards based system is said to be in place, there is no evidence of any improved productivity but, thanks to the assessment and verification processes, training consultants are lining up at the Porsche showrooms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Training Board's boast that, by the end of 1993, 50 per cent of the work force would be covered and, by the end of 1995, 90 per cent of the work force would be covered is perfectly meaningless because industry groups say that it is certain that nowhere near that proportion will use the standards and that those who do will use them primarily for labour market classification purposes and not for training. Industry believes that there is a real risk that training is being introduced for training's sake to ensure that merely artificial targets are reached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian National Training Authority, ANTA, is concerned about the implementation of the national training reforms. In its consultancy brief for a review of training reforms, ANTA noted its concern with the growing complexity and the lack of understanding and acceptance of the reforms by its key clients, industry and individuals. In a damning comment in mid-1993, the ACTU Assistant Secretary and ANTA board member, Bill Mansfield stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is of serious concern that the reform process is not both owned and driven by industry. In the key forums . . . there is often only a nominal presence by industry representatives, of employers and employees through their unions. The people who are designing and driving the changes are largely government officials who, although dedicated people, often don't have a practical understanding of industries' needs and also, when implementing change, are inclined to become too complex in their processes.</PARA>
<PARA>One stated concern by employers was that DEET is funding all sorts of obscure non-industry groups to do Australian vocational certificate pilots while anything that industry wants is stalled for eight months. Consultation by DEET has been a sham, with millions of dollars being poured into pseudo consultations which are no more than a means of claiming consultation to justify previously determined policy outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, while industry broadly supports the goals of the national training reforms, the training reform agenda is seen as not relevant to what is actually happening on the ground in business. Competency based training is useful only up to a point. Employers want a crisp list of short descriptions of competency&mdash;not 300-page dissertations, which is what is happening. For example, the electrical and electronic standards cost $550 and are 4 1/2 inches thick. The economic performers of Asia are going another way, preferring the concept of maximising proficiency rather than achieving a minimum or floor competency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the rest of the world, competency based training has collapsed under its own paperweight, as ANTA's ongoing review points out. In other countries where there is a recognition of the importance of a national skills formation strategy, there is a growing emphasis by governments on decentralisation of control over public funds for post-compulsory vocational education and training to intermediary bodies to reflect better the demand side of the training market. There is also widespread use by governments such as those in France, Sweden and New Zealand of competitive bidding to promote a more responsive and flexible provision of publicly funded training and an enhanced role for employer-led bodies in the training market through control over how public training funds are actually spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ongoing report by ANTA finds that, broadly speaking, TAFE colleges, which are after all the linchpin of vocational education and training, are failing to manage properly, unable to introduce their own internal reforms, inflexible in their course structures and insufficiently responsive to industry needs. So the government has a D-minus record when it comes to vocational education and training in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Between 1985 and 1990, enrolments of school leavers in TAFE colleges fell from 22 per cent to 12 per cent. Last month a report found that the problem with the TAFE system is not its bad image. It found that the bad image was justified on many scores, such as inadequate campus facilities. It believes that the government needs to improve the product before it proceeds with its expensive marketing campaign. In the meantime, the government, in its usual inimitable fashion, proceeds to put the cart before the horse. Training for training's sake will not help the one million unemployed Australians and training for the unions' sake will not help this country to thrive economically. </PARA>

It is quite clear that the private sector can deliver letters in the cities cheaper than Australia Post can&mdash;indeed, Australia Post itself could do it more cheaply&mdash;but the private sector will not even bother to deliver letters to Gascoyne Junction, Marble Bar or Nullagine and other remote places, places that in Australia deserve the quality of service that we have built up over many years. </PARA>

We cannot achieve with these people the direct services, the niche services, that we can with ANL. A policy decision of the party gives the government the right to sell 49 per cent of ANL.

It consumes grapes worth about $1 billion a year, and would like to buy them from Australia. We can deliver those grapes very effectively and of very high quality using this new technique. </PARA>

It was only when Japan had the world's greatest economy that it lifted those barriers. We saw some very silly investments on its part, but it has regrouped and I think it will be much more sensible in future. Taiwan is another one.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After hearing comments from Labor members about the government's budget, one could be excused for thinking that this budget was going to solve all of Australia's problems. I believe that the budget is a giant con. It has failed to tackle the real issues that are besetting Australia as a nation and the economy and that the community at large has not been given all the information that it needs. I am not just being party political in making those comments. I do so because of some fundamental weaknesses in Australia's economy and financial position and because of the social trends that have been occurring, mainly under the Commonwealth and state Labor governments of the past 11 years or so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I assert that this budget is increasing the debt of the nation. It is increasing the borrowings of government. It is increasing the cost of maintaining those borrowings. It is putting pressure on interest rates because government borrowings compete with borrowings from the private sector. Because of the nature of Australia and its relatively small capital base, the borrowings have to come not only from the domestic market but also from overseas. Because of the way the economy is being handled or mismanaged at the moment, there is an inevitable trend that will result in an increase in interest rates by the end of this year. Those increases in interest rates are a hidden cost that are not accounted for in this budget and should be revealed for what they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give some broad figures. At the moment the national debt is in the vicinity of $210 billion. I might add that 10 years ago the national debt was around $35 billion. So that is an outstanding increase that this government refuses to acknowledge to the community but one which is insidious, dangerous and threatens the future of our children because it will be the children of present workers in this community who will have to bear the burden, by and large, of the debt that we pass on to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I concede that the $200-odd billion debt is not all government debt. But some $95 billion or $98 billion, depending on the figures that we use, is in fact government debt. If we look at the budget papers, we will see that this budget actually proposes to increase the government debt. The budget papers say that the government will be required to finance its budget expenditure by borrowing around $20 billion&mdash;I think it is somewhere between $19 billion and $20 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the reading and research that I have done, this government has committed the nation to a cycle of borrowing at least $30 billion a year for the next three years. That means that in about three years time the government proportion of the total national debt will have increased from around $30 billion to around $100 billion. I come from the private sector. I know a bit about business. I know what it takes to make a business profitable. I also understand very much that businesses that are profitable employ people and give them permanent and satisfying jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were to run a business on the basis that we pay our recurrent expenditures by continually borrowing and say to our bank manager and board of directors, `It will be okay. You don't have to worry because we predicate a growth in the world economy and in the national economy and that will pay our debt off,' I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker Rocher&mdash;I am sure you know this from your considerable experience in the real world of business&mdash;that no business could sustain borrowings on that basis. Business can only sustain borrowings on real figures, on market research, on product analysis and on substantial proof that the borrowings can be sustained and repaid. But government members, with their fingers crossed behind their backs, are saying, `It will be okay. The world's recovering and we're going to recover, too.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government estimates growth at a bit more than four per cent. I acknowledge that the figures at the moment, particularly those announced yesterday, confirm that that estimate was reasonably sound. But there is one thing on which the government has not been brought to task, that it will not talk about properly or at all, that I think should be analysed urgently by this parliament and by all people in Australia who eventually will have to bear the burden of this government's mismanagement. The flaw in this whole thesis is that there is not enough investment happening in our economy to sustain and deliver the results that the government must have in order to achieve the target that it is seeking, which is that within three years we will start to reduce our debt. By the way, from the research I have done, our debt will have increased to $90 billion from the $30 billion we have now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a thesis that is! What a beauty! The government is saying that that is all dependent on achieving sustainable growth in the economy. But the present growth in the economy is occurring because of two major factors. The first is an increase in consumer spending. On the face of it, we might say that that is a good thing, but when it is being sustained by consumer confidence that is based on a post-recession psychological relief factor, we may ask ourselves whether this is going to be sustained. It can only be sustained if the quality of life and the way of life of the people out there can be sustained as well; in other words, their jobs are safe, their incomes are secure and they are not having their standard of living downgraded, which is happening. Their standard of living is, in fact, being downgraded. I will give some figures in a minute to prove that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason for the growth is government spending. Governments are spending money, by and large, based on borrowings in order to achieve growth. Again, those two factors need to be looked at very carefully. Sure, we have a five per cent growth, and I am pleased about that, but that five per cent growth cannot be sustained. If we sustain it by consumer spending and by government spending and not by private sector investment and spending, there will be a day of reckoning, and that will wreck this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not the only one who is saying that there is a lack of investment. The headline on the front page of today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> is `Boom! But there's still no investment'. For the benefit of those who have not read it, the editorial on page 20 under the heading `Strong growth with a weak link' draws attention to the dangerous situation that there is not adequate private sector investment in Australia. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The safest conclusion to draw from yesterday's heart-stopping national accounts figures is that the economy is still on a path of strong, non-inflationary growth&mdash;but with no evidence yet of the business investment that will be needed to keep the recovery going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most commonly quoted seasonally adjusted figures show the economy growing by 1.9 per cent in the March quarter. That's what sent the bond market into a spin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the seasonally adjusted numbers undoubtedly overstate the contribution of public consumption spending.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for business investment, the trend was down. Spending on equipment fell by about 7 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis (after allowing for the sale of the Gladstone power station). That drop in investment, of course, had already been flagged by the Bureau of Statistics' survey of new capital expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on further:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What seems much less likely is that DFAT or anyone else has seen the beginning of the investment miracle that Mr Willis needs to keep the economy growing at 4 per cent or more year after year, as is required to get the Budget into balance by 1997-98 and unemployment down to 5 per cent by the end of the decade.</PARA>
<PARA>These are serious matters. I therefore again say that I am a little sickened by the words of government members in support of their budget because they are not telling the whole truth to the community. Or, if I want to be charitable to the members of the government, they do not understand the serious malady of this economy and the serious disincentive to investment that has been going on in Australia. Let me remind honourable members that private capital investment in Australia is at its lowest since statistics commenced to be recorded in Australia's history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other reasons for me to be concerned. One of them is that the government has failed to tackle some of the factors that retard private investment. They have failed to have the courage to tackle the things that need to be done. Let me remind honourable members that on 1 June 1989, when Ralph Willis had responsibility for Australia's transport infrastructure, or at least for waterfront reform, he said that he would achieve radical reforms within a certain time frame. He made that dramatic announcement five years ago, which we all supported because of the urgency of addressing the costs of our waterfront. Those costs are borne by our exporters, who try to win dollars over there to help Australia sustain its spending within the economy, to help maintain jobs and to maintain the standard of living of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give the House some figures. At the time that Willis made his announcement, five years ago, New Zealand was already under way with its reform program and had reduced its cargo costs at that time to only 83 per cent of Australia's. They were still too high but, nevertheless, it had done that. Five years later, in the post-reform era, the so-called `Willis reform era', costs in New Zealand are now only 40 per cent of the rates for contracts entered into after the changeover to enterprise agreements in Australia. Stevedore and terminal charges in Australia have slightly increased on the trans-Tasman trade, while New Zealand's costs have been reduced by 48 per cent. Current Australian cargo charges are approximately now 60 per cent higher than current New Zealand charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give the House some other examples of this great disparity to show how inept this government is in managing Australia's economy and shaping its future. In the South-East Asia trade, a firm called Liner Shipping Services has found that from a base of, say, 100 per cent for the port of Melbourne, Sydney costs today are 84 per cent, Singapore's are 23 per cent, Port Kelang's are 10 per cent and Jakarta's are 13 per cent. For the great expansion of trade into South-East Asia, which our children rely on Australia achieving for their future, and which is so much of Keating's public strategy, this presents a flaw in Keating's strategy&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XU5">Mr LIEBERMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This flaw would be laughable in other circumstances if it were not so damned serious. It is a pattern that is repeated in other trades. In Australia-New Zealand trade against Melbourne, using Melbourne as a 100 per cent base, Burnie performs best amongst Australian ports, at 19 per cent of Melbourne's cost, but it is followed closely by the New Zealand ports, which range from 25 per cent to 35 per cent. Sydney rates at 79 per cent of Melbourne's costs and Fremantle at 76 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once in Europe, shipping operators face costs that are 44 per cent of Melbourne's. In Zeebrugge they are 63 per cent; in Tilbury, 31 per cent; in Barcelona and Rotterdam, 66 per cent. Only Hamburg is more expensive, at 108 per cent of Melbourne's costs. In the Japan-Far East trade, Yokahama is a mere 39 per cent of Melbourne's costs; Osaka, 41 per cent; Nagoya, 45 per cent; with Hong Kong only 14 per cent and Taiwan 26 per cent of Melbourne's costs. At home, by contrast, Sydney's costs are 73 per cent of Melbourne's and Brisbane's are 50 per cent. How can this government claim that it is managing the economy well and doing the things that it needs to do with that dismal report, five years after the government proclaimed publicly its firm intention to achieve reform in these vital areas?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give another illustration of why I am concerned about costs that are building up and that are not publicly acknowledged by the government or fully understood by many. Let us look at the health system. The health system is partly funded by the Medicare levy, which is now 1.4 per cent. That does not cover the full costs of health care but it covers a substantial part of them. It is based on the principle of Medicare; that is, that access to reasonable health care requirements is available to all, funded by Medicare and consolidated revenue at public hospitals and through an insurance system that pays, by and large, a large proportion of doctors' accounts. But there has always been a gap in the amount that governments can afford to pay for the demand from the public for health care. People who take out private health insurance have helped to fund that gap. It is essential in Australia that our health system be modelled so as to maximise the contribution that both the public and private sectors can make. In a true partnership the costs can be kept down and the service will be provided to all that need it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, as a result of government policies, over the last 12 months another half a million Australians have dropped out of private health insurance because they cannot afford to stay on in private health insurance any longer. When those people require health care they will look increasingly to the public health sector, that is, to the taxpayer eventually, for their requirements. In other words, they will no longer be contributing on top of their Medicare levy an additional amount for private insurance which helps to cover the national health costs in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the introduction of Medicare, nearly half of the population covered by private health insurance has dropped out under Labor. Under the Hawke-Keating governments, nearly half of the people who were insured in Australia to supplement the costs of health care have dropped out&mdash;from 70 per cent of people insured in 1983 down to about 38 per cent now. Let me cite a stark figure to illustrate the time bomb that will result from this trend. The time bomb is that, as every one per cent of the population drops out of private health insurance, it will cost Medicare in excess of $100 million extra per year. They are the figures that I invite the members of the government to comment on in their responses to this appropriation debate. Where will that extra $100 million come from?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw the spectacle of the ex-health minister, ex-Senator Richardson, flagging an inevitable increase in the Medicare levy. At least he was being honest at that time. We have seen the political spectacle of the new Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) coming in and saying, `I am looking at it,' and then, `No, I am not.' Then the budget came in and the government got caught; it could not increase taxes in this budget directly. It had to do it indirectly. The government has increased the total tax take in this budget by a number of means, which if I had more time to talk about I could explain. Perhaps during consideration of the bill in detail we will get into that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the government has set a time bomb for Australians by adding an extra $100 million a year for every additional one per cent of population dropping out of private health insurance. The people who are suffering pain, who need elective or pain relieving surgery&mdash;not traumatic surgery&mdash;the people waiting now for operations in the hospitals, will inevitably have to spend more time in the queues. The tragedy is that many of the people in those queues are on low incomes or fixed incomes, retired and pensioners, poor people or unemployed people, who have no choice and who cannot go out and buy insurance anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bitter irony for Australia is that the equity in health systems is diminishing and the poor people are being pushed further down the queues. Without being too disrespectful, the people dropping out of private health insurance are hopping on the queues for their elective surgery and pushing the poor people further down the list. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The past business migration schemes emphasised a short-term focus; thus they were certain to fail. The new policies have been developed with a longer term vision, especially in the context of the internationalisation of the Australian economy and Australia's role in the Asia-Pacific region. As we are all aware, the Asia-Pacific region is the major growth area of the 1990s.

These are good and sufficient reasons to open our doors to business men and women from around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of its work, the Deveson inquiry did an analysis of 276 applicants from February 1992 to February 1994.

Men and women from overseas with money, drive, ambition and skills are much needed by our business community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report does show a commendable pragmatism in supporting a mechanism whereby people temporarily in Australia should be allowed to stay permanently on the basis of having already established a business.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The business migration program recognised the need for more flexibility and some modification was necessary&mdash;including to those two additional categories&mdash;to make the rules simpler to allow those in Australia to apply.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make two suggestions. They are the concept of project based migration and the concept of investment linked migration. Project based migration is a mechanism that would allow for migration to Australia on the basis of a particular industry skill and capital contribution which would create or enhance a business project in Australia. The committee that carried out this investigation decided that there were perhaps too many risks to be taken and therefore did not take this up. But I believe that we should look at project based migration for a trial period of three years. No-one can foresee the future, but let us trial this project carefully and thus make our decision from real world experiences. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second option is investment linked migration. Honourable members will be aware of the recent remarks by Mr John Ralph, President of the Business Council of Australia. In speaking to the Fifth National Business Summit, he said:</PARA>

<PARA>The problems raised with the concept of investment linked migration are essentially problems of a business nature. They involve, for example, the real value of funds made available through investment linked migration versus the costs of funds available through the existing avenues, the likelihood of flow-on benefits to Australia, risks to the investor, availability of suitable investments and marketability of such a scheme in Australia and abroad. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would urge all members to look at the whole question of migration in a non-materialist fashion. People can never be reduced to units of labour or inputs and outputs. The great benefit to Australia of migration is the brains and the ambitions of the migrants and the children they have. It is this psychological and commercial orientation that helps bind the nation together, raises the business energy level and gives faith and hope that we can continue to be a successful and prosperous country and society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be able to make a contribution in this budget debate. I add to what has been said by many speakers on this side of the House: this budget demonstrates poignantly for all Australians that this government continues to be simply a tax and spend government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to receive recently a copy of the Australian candidates study that was carried out by the Australian National University of candidates from all parties at the 1993 election. I will read the results of the response to the question `If the government had a choice between reducing taxes or spending more on social services, which do you think it should do?' This particular document is a table, the top of which asks for the response `strongly in favour of reducing taxes'. Of the ALP candidates we find that only 2.5 per cent are strongly in favour of reducing taxes. Of the Democrat candidates only 4.3 per cent are strongly in favour of reducing taxes but of the Liberal and National parties' candidates 56.6 per cent were strongly in favour of reducing taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It goes down to the other end of the scale where the question relates to whether the candidates are strongly in favour of spending more on social services. We find that the Labor Party figure was 43.2 per cent; it was 47.9 per cent for the Democrats. This really cemented the view I have always had of the Labor Party: it is simply in favour of taking money off people through the tax system. I believe it has got it all completely wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this particular budget the tax take increases in real terms by 7.4 per cent. The government has abandoned the second round of tax cuts&mdash;that great promise, that l-a-w rhetoric we heard from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) prior to the last election. That becomes the Prime Minister's hidden jobs levy. Increases in excises and sales taxes in the 1994-95 year, which were legislated last year, will raise an additional $2 billion. The fringe benefits tax, which we have been concentrating on in recent days because of its complexity, will raise an extra $1,830 million in 1994-95, a massive increase of 130.7 per cent on 1993-94. An extra $800 million per annum is to be raised from so-called tighter compliance measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other tax increases in the budget which are disguised as so-called cost recovery. For instance, the revamped departure tax has been increased from $25 to $27 per departure. Admittedly, the system of collecting it has been changed so it is not so obvious. That will result in another $30 million of revenue to the government, a 27.2 per cent increase on last year. Other increased Commonwealth charges will raise tens of millions of dollars more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has got it all wrong. The present strong growth we are seeing in the economy and which the government of course is pleased about&mdash;so are we; there is no reason not to be&mdash;just shows what we are capable of as a country. These growth figures are being achieved in spite of all the constraints that exist on business within this country. The thing that concerns me&mdash;I think it concerns a lot of Australians&mdash;is that this country really could be great. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sorts of results we are seeing as we come out of the recession indicate that we could be great, yet the country continues to labour under an industrial relations system which is still completely out of touch with reality. Just how out of touch with reality the current Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) is has been demonstrated clearly for us all in recent days. Only weeks ago we had the latest piece of legislation which was going to do all sorts of things, yet just in the last couple of days we have seen a major backdown, a major turnaround, as the minister says that he has listened to what business had to say. My concern is why he did not listen before he caused all the problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also labour as a country under a tax system which provides at every turn a major disincentive to private investment and individual effort. The government is sitting back scratching its head and wondering why investment is not occurring as we come into something of a boom cycle. The answer is very simple: the incentives are not there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government constantly compares Australia's performance with that of other countries within the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development, the OECD. It does that when it is convenient to do so. It managed to demonstrate that a five per cent growth rate was amongst the highest in the OECD. It managed to demonstrate that our inflation rate was amongst the lowest in the OECD. Yet we frequently hear the Prime Minister and his colleagues talking about how Australia is now a part of Asia; that our future is entwined with its future. When we compare our performance with that of the Asian economies, particularly the tiger economies, we find how far we fall short. So, when it is convenient, the Labor Party wants to compare our performance with that of the developed countries of the OECD and, for other reasons, at other times it wants us to be a part of Asia. If we are a part of Asia, let us start acting like that and revamp and redirect our economy so that we can survive as a part of Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently visited the Republic of Korea. An economic miracle has occurred in the 40 years since the Korean War. Seoul was completely wiped out 40 years ago. The reason that miracle has occurred is very simple: the climate there has encouraged and motivated, perhaps even coerced, people into working hard. A six-day, 12-hour a day working week is still common there, as it is in many Asian countries. I am not suggesting that we need to do exactly that, but we need to recognise that there are significant differences in attitudes in those countries with which we like to see our future enmeshed. Korea is one of those countries. So too are Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong, which is achieving fantastic economic results. I do not suggest that we should grow at the same rate as China, or perhaps even Vietnam, which are growing rapidly off a very low growth rate, but I do see a threat in the future that even those economies will outperform Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite all the signs and all the optimism that we see even in today's newspapers, with headlines about booms and turnarounds, we are still subject to the very real threat of becoming a banana republic. When the Prime Minister made that statement some years ago, I think he actually told the truth. I do not think there have been many other times when he was Treasurer and since he has been Prime Minister that he has been so frank, but he was right then. That threat has not gone away. This country is still subject to that threat. All of the indicators are there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Lee Kuan Yew was here recently he put it even more clearly and directly when he talked about the potential Australia had to become the white trash of Asia. That is the threat that hangs over us. We must recognise that we are geographically in Asia and that part of the world and that our future is closely entwined with the countries of Asia. We must start to perform like the economies of Asia. If we do not do that, and if we do not make the right decisions now to head the Australian economy in that way, we will fail and end up becoming a banana republic. When I heard the Prime Minister in the last few days desperately trying, with the hyperbole that only he can muster, to talk the economy up, twisting arms and carrying on the way he does, it really started to worry me. Yet it illustrates how little in the end the business community trusts him. Why should it trust him?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look back over the years that the Prime Minister was the Treasurer of this country, we see that he consistently misled people on the true state of affairs in Australia. He consistently tried to tell us that this was the year the budget would `bring home the bacon' and, in more recent days, that we were going `bang busters' in this or that direction. He has cried wolf so often that it is not surprising people do not believe him. Nor should he be surprised now that, despite the signs being there, business is still not prepared to take risks and to provide the investment that is absolutely essential to underpin an ongoing strong recovery phase into future years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the biggest problem facing this country is its debt. Day after day in this place we ought to constantly remind the people of Australia of the situation this government has led us into. As a legacy of the 10 years of Labor government, we have a huge problem. Our net foreign debt in just four years since 1989 has increased from $121 billion to $174 billion. Considering that figure was only $30 billion in 1983, I realise that this government has sent this country close to bankruptcy. It will be only good luck now that avoids that prospect. We are not seeing good management, so we will have to rely on good luck. The government's only solution to that problem is to sell off the farm. Australian people need to be aware of that. The government's sudden enthusiasm about privatisation is no more than an excuse to sell off the farm to fund its grandiose schemes. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has a commitment to selling anything it can to raise money. Its plans to sell off Qantas and the Federal Airports Corporation are not predicated on any commitment to making those organisations more efficient; they are simply predicated on giving the government access to grab the money and spend it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to stand here and make my first speech, not in a parliament but in this parliament, as the federal member for Fremantle. I had a very signal honour in being elected to that seat, because it is a seat with a long and honourable history. My predecessors `Curtin', `Beazley' and `Dawkins' are often referred to in that way&mdash;by their surnames&mdash;without any need to elaborate. They have all made a very substantial contribution, not just to Fremantle but also to the nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I begin the major part of my speech, I would like to thank the electors of Fremantle because they, in many ways, took a risk with me. While experienced at a state political level, I was untried in the federal arena and they embraced me as someone who lived outside the electorate&mdash;I am now delighted to say that I live within the electorate&mdash;as wanting to represent their interests. It was said during the election campaign that this was to be a referendum on Mabo. If that was the outcome, it was a resounding endorsement of the federal government's position on Mabo since there was a substantial swing to the government, unusual in a by-election, particularly after such a long period in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also said that it would be an opportunity for the people of Fremantle to express the views of the wider Western Australian community and to show their attitude&mdash;one of disdain, it was said by my opponents&mdash;towards the Keating government. Again, the swing to Labor is very clearly an endorsement of the Keating government's program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The people of Fremantle are a fine people. They represent, in many ways, the best of the characteristics of Australia. The issues that face the electorate of Fremantle are, in microcosm, the issues that face the wider society. As their elected representative, I will do what they have asked me to do, that is, to ensure that some of the tensions that exist in the seat of Fremantle and in the wider society are managed&mdash;tensions between urban development and growth as opposed to environmental protection and the protection of heritage; tensions between industry expansion and suburban amenity; tensions between community safety and protection and individual liberty; and tensions between rapid economic growth and pockets of long-term unemployment. And, through all of this, the theme of hard work, of migration and multiculturalism&mdash;a theme of vigour&mdash;will be pursued by me as their member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take the opportunity to thank the people who worked with me during the campaign: my campaign manager, Mr Jim McGinty MLA, who is the state member for Fremantle; Mr Ed Russell, who took leave from his position as director of my office as Leader of the Opposition and who has since come with me to Canberra; Ms Renay Shehan, who did a tremendous job of pulling all the troops together; and not least those people who are often mentioned in the category of `those too numerous to mention' but who actually make political parties work: the branch members and supporters of the Fremantle electorate council, the people in the Labor Party, and those interested in our future in Western Australia. I thank them very much indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I am very proud to have been elected to this place in 1994&mdash;the centenary of women's suffrage in Australia. Australia has a proud record of pioneering women's rights. For most Australian women, the right to vote and stand for parliament was delivered by 1902. It occurred much earlier in South Australia&mdash;which is why we are celebrating the centenary this year&mdash;where we are told that, `amid loud cheering', the Women's Suffrage Bill 1894 was passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without the insistence&mdash;and the intransigence&mdash;of the South Australian delegates to the 1897 constitutional convention, Australia may have come into being as a nation without providing some mechanism for women to vote. Our founding fathers, as they were, initially failed to include women's suffrage in the constitution that gave birth to the nation in 1901. It was only by an act of parliament the next year that women were empowered to vote in the second federal election of 1903. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the first federal poll held in 1901, women were in fact reduced to campaigning for male candidates who would vote in their first term for female suffrage&mdash;a familiar position for many women in our community. The federal franchise did not flow automatically to those states where women were still denied the vote. Victoria, in 1908, became the last state to enfranchise women, by which time women in that state had already voted in two federal elections! I suppose that highlights some of the idiocies of federal-state relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The centenary of women's suffrage should, in my opinion, become an occasion for mapping out new political goals for women, and how we intend to achieve them. One hundred years after Australian women first were able to vote, we are confronting the fact&mdash;I think head on for the first time&mdash;that having the right to stand for parliament has by itself been insufficient. It has not resulted in significant numbers of women winning seats. You need only look in this place, when members are here in numbers, to see what I mean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to make the real changes needed to correct what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has described as `one of the great flaws in Australian democracy'. I am sad to have to endorse that view and the views of political columnist Alan Ramsey, who is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are rarely any free kicks for women in politics. No matter how much or how little ability they might have, and whatever the expedient rhetoric of the time, men run politics and women get only what men allow them to have. Mostly, they're manipulated, exploited and patronised.</PARA>
<PARA>That is from a long-time observer of federal politics. The Australian Law Reform Commission's perhaps more carefully worded draft report on women's equality before the law suggested that, in a system free of discrimination, women would share equally in political power and policy formation and know that when parliament made laws it considered whether the law took women's wellbeing into account. At the moment we have no such assurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The post-suffrage political progress of women has been excruciatingly slow. It was two decades after federal enfranchisement before a woman&mdash;Edith Cowan from Western Australia, I am pleased to say&mdash;was elected to a state parliament. It was four decades before Enid Lyons and Dorothy Tangney became the first women to be elected to Canberra&mdash;Lyons to the House of Representatives and Tangney to the Senate. It was 6 1/2 decades before Annabel Rankin became the first woman minister. Although Enid Lyons in the 1940s had held cabinet ranking, she did not actually have a ministerial portfolio, which is a curious position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was 7 1/2 decades before it became established&mdash;and accepted&mdash;that women candidates did not repel the male vote. I remember it being said that women should not stand in marginal seats because they would repel male voters and that they should not stand in safe seats because they were not good enough for the honour of that position, which left them in a rather difficult position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was eight decades before it became de rigeur for there to be at least one woman in a cabinet and nine decades, a long 90 years, before it became widely accepted and the stated policy of a major political party&mdash;my own&mdash;that women were entitled to more than tokenism and should in fact participate equally in the political system. I am pointing to recent rule changes in Victoria, which I hope will spread throughout my party nationally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is clear&mdash;anyone who thinks about it would agree&mdash;that parliament should represent and reflect the views of all the people, not just half the people. But to have more women in parliaments, we need more women in politics&mdash;at all levels. That is not just what I want; it is what a great many Australians, men and women alike, are demanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, I would like to read to the House one of the responses to the purple postcard campaign, which invited Australian women to write to the government and outline what concerned them. One woman wrote, very honestly I think:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No matter how we try, how successful we are, the barrier is still there put up by men. My husband will say to women in high places appearing on TV `Go home and mend your husband's socks'.</PARA>
<PARA>Her letter called for `more government time spent on helping us fight this and win'. I agree. After a century of the vote, the time has come for action. Action to change the rules to accommodate women, not just to encourage more of them into politics. At this rate, someone pointed out to me that it will take 300 years before we get fifty-fifty representation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be pointed out that women's political party membership is generally much higher than our representation in parliaments or party decision making processes. Indeed, before the Liberal Party was established in 1944, the Australian Women's League was the largest conservative political force in this country. Still, at that time, there were only two women in parliament in 1944. Fifty years on and there are still only 32&mdash;that is only 14 per cent of all our MPs and senators. We need to ensure that more women are involved in political life and seek their share of positions of power and responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recent research on women and government in Australia and New Zealand, undertaken for the Commonwealth and state ministers on the status of women, shows that women and men are equally willing to vote. Amongst those who do not turn out for elections, you do not find a higher proportion of women. In fact, women aged 25 to 35 have been the key group of swinging voters since 1987, so women are watching the political process very closely indeed. Issues such as education, health, family and community based economic issues have been particularly important to them and they have driven the political agenda in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It also needs to be said that women are just as likely as men to participate in election campaigning and to take part in protests, demonstrations and lobbying campaigns&mdash;indeed, in some areas, perhaps even more likely to do so. The problem seems to be the question of gaining preselection. How do people break through that barrier, particularly preselection for a safe seat?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some research suggests that women tend to have limited support to nominate, that they may see preselection processes as unfair, that they know the likelihood of preselection for a safe seat is relatively low and that it is often hard to gain support&mdash;factional support in the case of my party, and group support in the case of the conservatives. There are also, clearly, attitudinal barriers in some people's minds: women themselves may be less likely to see politics as a career; may feel that politicians do not make much of a difference to their lives&mdash;a view sadly shared by a great many people; may consider politics to be a very high risk profession and one requiring a lot of aggression and unpleasantness; or may simply not know how to start. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women may feel that the likely demands on families are too great. I agree with that&mdash;too great for men and for women. Consequently, if you look around, you will see that women in political life do tend to be single or to have grown-up children. I think women are also saying that they see that their skills and experience are not recognised and valued. I think that is part of the reason why they do not participate in politics as frequently as they might. It is difficult to understand, frankly, why there should be the view that women do not have skills and experience. If you look around the country, you will see women running hospitals, universities, schools and corporations, right through to community organisations and the school tuckshop, as well as their family home, and frequently juggling those responsibilities with panache. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women are achieving international success across the board, in the sciences, the arts and sports. In many respects our political life lags behind the rest of our community life. I want to make a case very clearly that women have half this country's talent, creativity and ideas. Although it is harking back a bit, I quote from George Bernard Shaw. In a preface to a work of his, `In good King Charles's golden days', he said the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But representation on merely plangent Parliamentary bodies is not sufficient. Anybody can complain of a grievance; but its remedy demands constructive political capacity. Now political capacity is rare; but it is not rarer in women than in men. Nature's supply of five per cent or so of born political thinkers and administrators are all urgently needed in modern civilisation; and if half of that natural supply is cut off by the exclusion of women from Parliament and Cabinets the social machinery will fall short and perhaps break down for lack of sufficient direction. Competent women, of whom enough are available, have their proper places filled by incompetent men: there is no Cabinet. . . that would not be vitally improved by having its male tail cut off and female head substituted.</PARA>
<PARA>While I am not recommending that in a particular case, I think it is very clear that in that respect, too, George Bernard Shaw was a man ahead of his time. We need to examine the selection process that is blocking all that talent from being brought into this place. We have to examine the process of gatekeeping and the gatekeepers for the legislative elite who ensure that, while many are eligible to stand, few are chosen. We need to ask why there are even fewer women in safe seats, where selection is tantamount to election. It is the process of selection, after all, which determines the composition of parliaments and the talent from which governments, and oppositions, are formed. The outcome in Western democracies, not just our own, is that that selection process, that gatekeeping, has resulted in representation which is largely white, male and predominantly middle class. I am not suggesting there is some conspiracy, but the process has produced that outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at explanations for why there are so few women. There is the so-called demand side explanation, which says that the selection process, either directly or indirectly, discriminates against women. There are many who hold that view&mdash;and, indeed, many who have experienced it! Directly, judgments are made on the basis of gender or racial or class stereotypes and they assume that there are certain group characteristics that apply to individual applicants. In other words, `You are not tough enough and you are not articulate enough because you are a woman.' Those are the sorts of explanations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of these demand side explanations talk about indirect discrimination. In other words, the people making the decisions about selection have assumptions about the appropriate role or character of candidates which militate against certain groups being selected. For instance: `It is best to have a young family man with three or four children who are presentable and can be paraded before the cameras.' That is the ideal candidate. Equally: `A woman with young children is actually in some ways betraying her class.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw to the attention of members the experience of a candidate in Perth. I will not mention the political party to which she was connected because it might be unseemly in a first speech. A young woman called Terry Bolden was putting herself forward for a Perth electorate selection. She was asked by the committee why she would contemplate entry into politics when she had young children, because her husband would in some way be diminished by her doing that. A committee member said to her that he did not believe women should go into politics. Another well known independent in Western Australia, Liz Constable&mdash;she became independent partly because of these processes&mdash;also recognised this problem and said that when she had gone through preselection she was asked who would put the tea on the table in the evening. So there are those sorts of indirect discriminations about what is the appropriate role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other side, there are so-called supply side explanations, such as that only certain groups will seek nomination, or are able to seek nomination, and that the selections actually reflect the choices that are available to the selectors. It is said that it is really because the women are not there; it is not because there is any discrimination being applied to them. It is also said that some women have attitudes which discourage them; that they do not feel that they are politically competent&mdash;I referred to some of those earlier; that they do not have the confidence because they have been brought up differently; or that they lack appropriate political experience and we can expect gradual progress as they become more experienced and take part in politics more frequently. After 100 years, how much more is needed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also said that there are lifestyle constraints which make it difficult for women to balance family and career. The logic of this argument is that if we had more from minority groups willing to present themselves as candidates then we would have more women in parliament. I do not believe that is the case. I think we have to change the rules to ensure that women are not subjected to discrimination at any level in our system. I draw attention to the perverse nature of the position I have just outlined. As Dale Spender put it in a recent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women have been prevented from doing what men do and then been blamed for not doing it.</PARA>
<PARA>She quotes a couple of very interesting historical examples. One was Aphra Behn, a very successful playwright in the 1680s. Her colleagues, however, thought she was not really a top-class playwright. It was said that her plays were not any good because she did not know any Greek. `No Greek, no merit,' they superciliously declared. Behn, not surprisingly, thought that was a bit rich. The same men who had stopped women from learning Greek then turned around and said that they were no good because they could not use it! I think what Spender goes on to say is very important:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Men can't or won't see that their definitions of merit, expectations and experience are nothing more than rules they have made up to protect their own positions&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>unconsciously and unwittingly. There are current themes around that say, `We would like to give women preselection but they are not up to it.' In my view, that is nonsense. I conclude by asking what is perhaps an insulting question for those members who are sitting here listening. What is required of a member of parliament that a woman&mdash;any woman&mdash;cannot do? The answer? Nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is required of a member of parliament? John Stuart Mill said, `We require enlightened individuals who will be mature and responsible because they reflect upon the issues that face them.' They are not qualifications: they are attitudes; they are virtues. I think we must be clear about that. There is nothing&mdash;no particular expertise, qualification or background&mdash;that precludes women from parliament, and nor should there be. This is not a meritocracy; this is a democracy. We need people from all walks of life and from all backgrounds. The one thing that is required is to represent voters' interests. So there is no gruelling preparation, no management training, no assessment of moral probity, no assessment of altruism, no special training, and no particular skill in communication or management. Some might say they are not even required to be particularly diligent, although most are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this is the time for us to reassess our position in this society on the way women are represented in parliament and throughout the community. It is a very convenient view to say that women do not hold power because they are incapable of holding it and that merit is the reason that they are excluded. If we were simply selected on the basis of merit, this parliament would be 50 per cent women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My message to women is: do not wait to be asked; do not wait to be pressured into political life&mdash;put up your hand and demand that you participate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;May I be the first to congratulate the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) on her maiden speech in this place. It was certainly an interesting speech on the need for more women to be represented at all levels of politics in Australia. The honourable member for Fremantle alluded to the need for a change in attitudes. I wish her all the best in changing the attitude of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) towards women. After reading the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> earlier this week, I think that the honourable member for Fremantle will have a task on her hands to change that attitude.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government presented the budget a few weeks ago. The reaction to the budget in my electorate is that it is a lame duck that does nothing to stimulate business investment and nothing to create employment. On budget night everyone seemed to think that at least it did not have the nasties of last year&mdash;no new taxes. The reason for that is that most of the nasties, the new taxes, were in last year's budget and they span the next three or four years. The increases announced last year included increases in the fuel tax, wine tax, sales tax and fringe benefits tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nasties in this year's budget include the selling off of the family silver, a lack of concern for reducing our foreign debt and the increased spending program. This government will not go down in history as a reformist government; it will be remembered as a tax and spend government&mdash;a government that has mortgaged the future of this country, which future generations will have to pay for, to achieve short-term political gain. The Prime Minister has recognised that our foreign debt has reached crisis point but refuses to do anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amount of creative accounting involved in this rubbery budget is excessive. We have a deficit that has been artificially deflated via asset sales but these sales have not even been passed by the Labor Party conference, which will be held later this year. We have continuing tax increases that the government is simply not willing to admit exist. To aid the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and Prime Minister, who seem hell bent on convincing themselves that no new taxes will be introduced this year, I refer them to the increase in the petrol tax that will occur at the beginning of August. Again, this tax increase was announced last year. I refer them to the increases in sales tax, wine tax and departure tax. All these taxes will be increasing this year. Just because they were not announced in this year's budget does not mean that they will not increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are real tax rises that will hit hard the people of Australia and in particular the people of the mid-north coast of New South Wales, which is the area I represent. The government tax take will be more next year than it is this year. Taxation is increasing. Total tax revenue has increased by 7.9 per cent. Tax revenue, as a percentage of GDP, will be higher next year than this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An area of particular concern in the budget for the people of my electorate is the further cuts to road funding. I have documented in this House on several occasions my views about why the Pacific Highway must become part of the national highway system. The Pacific Highway, which is a major link between Sydney and Brisbane, is not receiving the attention it deserves. Further cuts in this year's budget for road funding of $200 million will mean that spending on our roads will decrease further. This is simply irresponsible behaviour by this government as it knows full well that it is an important area of need and safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of particular concern to me is the statistic that federal road funding has been nearly halved in the last two years. Programs such as the black spot funding program have proven to be extremely successful in the past in preventing accidents on the mid-north coast of New South Wales. Statistics have shown the success of the black spot funding program and I encourage the government to reconsider its dismissal of this important program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this is an opportune time to counter the arguments on road funding put forward this week in the appropriations debate by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris). The honourable member for Shortland likes to remind the House that road funding has not actually been cut but rather now forms part of the untied grants to the states. The honourable member for Shortland forgets the very important issue of petrol excise. The Commonwealth collects $9.7 billion in petrol excise. If the Commonwealth is collecting this money surely it is the Commonwealth's responsibility to ensure that a large percentage of those taxes collected from road users is spent on roads. It is not doing that at the moment. If the government was truly wanting to defer the responsibility for road management to the states, why has it not transferred the more lucrative part of the deal&mdash;the fuel tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a government that is attempting to deny responsibility for road maintenance but is still quite happy to go on collecting all the money that should be spent on roads. One of the most damning statistics of this government's economic mismanagement of the nation is that when it entered office in 1983 two-thirds of the fuel tax that was collected was spent on road maintenance. Honourable members should bear in mind that the total fuel tax take from road users in 1983 was $1.3 billion and of that $850 million was spent on roads. This year the government will collect $9.7 billion from road users, of which only $820 million will be spent on roads. The tax take has absolutely skyrocketed and the government is spending a pittance on the roads in this nation. No wonder they are in such an abysmal state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is ripping off the people of this country, it is giving nothing in return and it is not only mortgaging the livelihood of our children through its economic policy but also jeopardising lives through an inconsistent policy on road maintenance. For every $10 this government takes in fuel tax, only $1 is returned in road funding. This is absolutely ludicrous. If the member for Shortland is adamant that the federal government no longer has responsibility for road funding, where does the other $9 go? Does the government give that money to the states? I do not believe it does. My view is that the Commonwealth has a far greater responsibility to ensure that the money collected from road users is directed back into road maintenance and road construction. At the moment it is not. It is being soaked up in the sponge and spent in other areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This gross economic mismanagement can also be seen in the area of asset sales. Anyone with any business sense knows that the money raised from asset sales should be either reinvested in other capital assets or used to eliminate debt. This government is doing neither. The government is going to embark on a massive asset sale program and it is going to spend the money on programs that were announced in this year's budget. It is not going to allocate that funding to the elimination or reduction of debt and it is not going to reinvest any of that funding in other capital assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have an argument going on in New South Wales at the moment about the private funding of a new hospital because governments cannot afford to invest capital in those types of projects. If this government does not believe we should be involved in owning airports and other commercial activities and wants to sell those assets, maybe it should seriously consider reinvesting the funds that are gained from those sales into other capital assets such as hospitals, universities and TAFE colleges. We know that the funding for these sorts of institutions is in short supply and that they are reaching a crisis point. The government is going to spend this money elsewhere but it has to remember that it can only sell the asset once and spend the money once. If the government were to maintain a profit returning asset it would have income each year. But in order to try to balance the deficit the government is going to sell these assets and spend the money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has now turned to selling the family silver to help satisfy its habit of spending and economic mismanagement. This country is now walking on the fine line of boom and bust economics. If we do not address the problem of ever increasing foreign debt we are going to end up in a very sad situation. If we were in private enterprise and facing the same situation the bankers and liquidators would be talking to us now. This government seems hell bent on heading further down that boom and bust path. I will quote someone outside of politics to add weight to the argument that this government is mismanaging this economy to a dangerous degree. Mr Don Mercer, Chief Executive Officer of the ANZ Banking Group, stated last week:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Failure to seize the opportunity of strong economic growth to cut the budget deficit more rapidly is going to leave Australia with higher domestic and external debt than is necessary or desirable. Put simply, most of the gains from a stronger economic outlook&mdash;the so-called `growth dividend'&mdash;are not being used to wind back the deficit and increase saving, but it will be spent. Clearly economic models can only approximate outcomes, but my concern based on our analysis is that the present budgetary settings and forecasts put Australia back on the path to boom and bust.</PARA>
<PARA>The mismanagement of the economy by this government is frightening to say the least. When the government tries to sell its budget it argues that there are no new taxes. We know that is not the truth. What about all the taxes we face this year including the increases in fuel tax and sales tax, and the taxes on wine, cigarettes and so on? Has the government thought about the increase in the departure tax and the 130 per cent increase in fringe benefits tax? This country has enormous potential, abundant natural resources, an intelligent and enthusiastic people and culture and a relatively stable government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ideals for this country in the 1990s must be the drive for a more flexible workplace, a drive towards stronger exports and export marketing, and a continued stability in government. This 1994 budget&mdash;or, indeed, this government&mdash;does nothing to improve workplace flexibility. As the events of this week have shown, the government seems unable to deliver on workplace flexibility. We had a new bill passed through this parliament before Christmas last year and it has been seriously amended already. This budget does nothing to improve exports and export marketing. The red tape involved in the process is excessive, the taxes on business are still excessive, and government support is still minimal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, this budget and this government in general are threatening our continued stability in this country. They do nothing to reach the very important ideals that our country desperately desires. As this budget clearly demonstrates, this government is simply not delivering. It is saying one thing and doing quite the opposite. The people of Australia must be made aware that they are paying increased consumption taxes. The sales tax take will be up 7.7 per cent; the petrol tax take will be up 12.6 per cent; and the fringe benefits tax take will be up 130.7 per cent. Most importantly, government outlays will increase by 2.9 per cent, taking total government outlays to 20 per cent of GDP, a real increase over the last five years of three per cent. This government will go down in history as a tax and spend government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the previous speaker, the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), I would like to add my congratulations to the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) on her excellent first speech in this House, and I can assure her that I will do my utmost to see that women in the electorate are made aware of her provoking views. Mindful of the 40 other members of this House who yet wish to speak on Appropriation Bill (No.1), I will be concise in my views.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1994-95 budget is extremely significant for a number of reasons, but for two reasons in particular. The first is that this year's budget was preceded by the federal government's announcement in its magnificent white paper of the effective strategy to address the unemployment problem in Australia. The second point I would like to make is about the significance of this budget's change in timing. This budget was brought down in May of this year, and this initiative was welcomed by the nation, particularly by the industry and community sectors. The 1994-95 budget is certainly an historic one, and I am very proud to be able to speak on the appropriation bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget is also the centrepiece of an economy experiencing a strong upturn in growth. The consequences of that growth will be an increase in the number of Australians being employed. With the white paper strategy in place within this positive economic environment, there is no doubt about the bright future that it will provide to this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the electorate that I represent, unemployment in some local areas is a very serious problem indeed. The first people hit in any economic downturn are those with the least education and those with a lack of serious training. Those people who live in the public housing areas in my electorate&mdash;suburbs such as Bridgewater, Gagebrook, Rokeby, Clarendon Vale and areas of the Huon Valley&mdash;are now better prepared for an economic upturn than at any time previously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for this is that this government&mdash;a federal Labor government&mdash;has emphasised the need for training and has established very successful training programs that have been working effectively for about 10 years. Previous speakers on the other side have been decrying these in this debate. I can assure the House, from my close scrutiny of almost all of the range of programs offered in my electorate by a whole range of training organisations, that these are going a long way to ensuring that the people whom I have mentioned&mdash;those with the least education and training&mdash;are now realising their potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those on the other side of this House have the incredibly naive notion that there is no need for training when there is a shortage of jobs. Their cry, if heeded, would mean that when the inevitable economic upturn arrives those people who still have not been trained will be disadvantaged in their pursuit of work. In other words, the very people already disadvantaged will be further disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am happy to report that the suburbs and regions that I have mentioned have been very well serviced by skillshare programs, LEAP schemes and industry training board programs located throughout my electorate. Many people who otherwise would not have been prepared for future employment, particularly those who have been in the long-term category, are now more ready and better equipped to take advantage of the greater employment opportunities facing this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the strong feature that underpins the white paper and the budget. It is a budget that accounts for economic upturn and gives those Australians most in need the leg-up they need to gain employment and again be part of the work force, with all its consequential benefits. Above all, this budget is a fair budget, one which recognises those Australians most in need of assistance and one which has the types of programs necessary for that assistance to be given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like now to talk about the initiatives in the budget that will implement the federal government's strategy that will put more Australians into the work force. The job compact provides the vision for Australia, one which includes the aim to reduce the unemployment rate to five per cent by the year 2000. Despite the hysterical outburst on the other side of the House, a five per cent rate of unemployment is a reasonable rate in the modern-day economy. Australians are becoming increasingly aware that they will not be staying in the same jobs all their lives, as many older Australians have done, including me. Most Australians would not choose to do the same job day in and day out for the rest of their lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia today more people go on to higher education than ever before and more people involve themselves in training and retraining in their adult lives. Australian society is more educated, more sophisticated and more part of the international economy than ever before. That is why a five per cent unemployment rate is not only achievable but desirable. There will always be a small component of the Australian labour force that will be retraining or educating itself to take advantage of changing employment requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very positive situation. It means that Australians are becoming more adaptable to change and, because the world of which we are a part is also constantly changing, Australians will contribute to that change. The lives of Australians, as a consequence, will have more variety and will be more rewarding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly pleased to see that the Commonwealth Employment Service will be introducing individual case management. This type of specialisation that I have mentioned previously in relation to employment will be effectively catered for by this initiative. In addition to that, those people unemployed will have the opportunity to regularly meet the same CES officer and to develop the kind of rapport necessary to find the most appropriate job placement for themselves. This initiative will particularly assist the long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apprenticeships and traineeships are also key components of the budget. That is particularly significant in the Franklin electorate, as many suburbs in my electorate have a very large young population with young families. Labor's target of 50,000 apprenticeships by 1995-96 falls very neatly into the positive economic forecasts. The international economic downturn, of which Australia was a part, brought the usual drop in the number of apprenticeships. This initiative in the white paper will ensure that our young people will re-enter our surging economy with the right skills to be active and consequently be rewarded participants in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important addition to the increase in apprenticeships is this budget's commitment to increased funding of $1.1 billion over a four-year period from 1994 to 1997 to increase the number of TAFE places. Whilst discussing the issue of apprenticeships and traineeships and their importance in this budget and that of the economic growth generally, I call on the Groom Liberal government to increase its commitment to apprenticeships. With the scaling down of the Department of Construction and the Public Service overall in Tasmania, the number of apprenticeships in my state has diminished greatly. I hope that the Groom government makes provision to reverse this trend in its budget to be brought down in the next few weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national training wage should provide the necessary incentive to encourage employers to take on new trainees. With the reduced cost of hiring, once again training will be the key to our modern economy. I am pleased that the ACTU and employer groups have endorsed the training wage initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to health. The increase in funding for breast cancer research and screening, a vital program, is a valued component of this budget. As a member of the House of Representatives committee inquiring into the treatment of breast cancer, I now understand the magnitude of this health problem for women and welcome the federal government's increased commitment to assist Australian women in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I wish to add my concern to those raised by the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) about the manner in which the establishment of a national cancer centre has been mooted. Evidence given to the House community affairs committee inquiry into the management and treatment of breast cancer has shown me the real need to rethink the role and responsibilities of this national centre. Perhaps we should wait until the committee has brought down its report before the exact terms are decided on once and for all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The home child-care allowance is another key component of this year's budget. This allowance gives greater flexibility to enable parents to stay at home with their young children. Unlike the dependent spouse allowance, the home child-care allowance is particularly targeted to low income families. About 55,000 such families who would otherwise have been unable to receive the full value of the dependent spouse rebate because their tax liability is too low will now receive on average an extra $20 per week with the introduction of this new allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national strategy to prevent child abuse and neglect is also an important component of this year's budget. Child abuse and neglect is another issue which is difficult for many in our community to confront, but it is one which we need to tackle seriously. For the first time we will have a national strategy that will bring existing programs to address child abuse and neglect together in a more coordinated and effective program with further resources. In this the International Year of the Family, that strategy is indeed timely. During last year's budget deliberations I made known both my concerns and those coming from my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is with great pleasure that I welcome this year's federal budget, a budget which is driven by fairness, a budget which tackles the unemployment problem with a long-term vision and with a series of practical programs, and a budget which also addresses many of the tough issues facing our nation. This is a Labor budget. I am happy to report that my electorate office has received considerable positive feedback about all aspects of this budget, and I have no hesitation in commending it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This budget depends upon growth and anticipated growth; it depends on forecasts that the Treasurer (Mr Willis) has made. But those growth forecasts need to be based on something real and not on consumption or consumption led growth only. They need to be based on investment led growth, not government spending led growth or, more importantly, government debt led growth. In recent days the latest figures have shown that 60 per cent of growth is coming from government spending.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the sparse amount of time offered to us in this debate, I want to raise the issue of why there is no investment in Australia. There are a number of reasons. The first is quite an obvious one: it is that Australian business still has too much debt. We all know what happened in the 1980s when there was too much irresponsible lending and too much overoptimistic borrowing. As well, the government thought it wise not to address the matter in a fiscally responsible way but rather to increase everybody's interest bill. Although in the middle 1980s we had growth, it was debt led growth, and the interest bill finished up breaking much of small business in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what are these businessmen, small and large, now trying to do? Firstly, they are trying to get their debt down. They are trying to make the maximum amount of profit, or the minimum loss&mdash;they are still going badly&mdash;which means paying their tax and then reducing their debt with the remaining profit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason why there is no investment in this country is that interest rates are still too high. I heard the Treasurer (Mr Willis) in this place only a day or two ago saying that the government was responsible for 13 consecutive reductions in interest rates. That belied the fact that those interest rates had come down from retail rates as high as 25 per cent. It is a fact that retail interest rates are still too high; 10 per cent is too high, let alone 11 per cent and 12 per cent. Why are they too high? They are too high because people think that inflation will go up, and expectations of inflation are the very basis of interest rates&mdash;profit on the money lent comes after that. Why do people expect inflation to go up? Because under Labor&mdash;until very recently, when we have had the worst recession for 60 years&mdash;it has always been high. Also, there is a recognition that, whilst the world might be coming out of the recession, economically the major blocs are somewhat comatose and therefore prices are staying down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third reason there is no investment is that people all believe interest rates will go up. Why do they think interest rates will go up? One of the reasons is that they are starting to realise that Australians and Australian businesses are the biggest per capita debtors in the world today, with only two exceptions: New Zealand, which is not a very large country; and Denmark, which is almost the same size as New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The $171.999 billion of net debt Australia owes to foreigners&mdash;that is the amount after all the investment we have in other parts of the world has been taken out&mdash;means that we owe about $10,000 per man, woman and child. Australians who also happen to be South Australian, as I am, each owe another $10,000 because of the absolutely scintillating mismanagement of that state by the Labor government in recent years! They know that, even if we were to repay $10 billion a year in today's terms, it would take 20 years to repay the debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody I see on the government side is even forecasting a budget surplus in the foreseeable future, let alone a current account surplus. We are not going to get investment by priming the pump. There are a couple of exceptions that I will come to shortly. But people know that on a per capita basis this country, compared with countries of substantial size, is the greatest debtor in the world and, from what I have seen in recent times, it seems that that debt will go close to $200 billion in a year's time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Welfare spending is a social necessity in many and varied circumstances. My party has always understood it and acted on that basis. However, when national public infrastructure in a budget such as this decreases over 20 years from 25 per cent to five per cent of budget expenditure, then it is reasonable for those investors to know that the infrastructure which they have to work with will not be as efficient as it was in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When there is too much welfare spending, the government cannot afford to go ahead with capital spending. For one reason or another, welfare spending has built up from 25 per cent of the budget 20 years ago to 39 per cent&mdash;probably more, if we could explore all the avenues, which are quite difficult to find in these budget papers, and work the figure out properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the government is caught on the horns of a dilemma. Nobody thinks that interest rates are going to go down; and people already have too much debt, so they do not invest. Most potential investors think that interest rates are going to go up, so they do not invest. Government spending on capital works is going down, and has been going down for years, so the advantages of that investment that would have been there are not there for business, and so they take that into account as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of exceptions to that, as I mentioned. If the government had thought to invest in productive infrastructure for the future, then I think there would be a bit more optimism in the business community. I will give one example. After much prompting during the election of 1993, the government finally followed the coalition and said that it would spend some money to look at finishing the surveying of the railway line from Alice Springs to Darwin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It budgeted for an expenditure of $1 million a year over three years. What do we find in this budget? It is a very small item, but it is very indicative: only $200,000 of that money has been spent. What has happened is that the matter has simply been put in the hands of consultants. Where are they based? They are based in Canberra. What are they going to do? They are going to try to organise the survey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, this government has not the slightest intention of going ahead with that railway line. That has been the case ever since R.J.L. Hawke said the same thing in 1983. If we are going to look towards Asia, that would be a very good indication to those people who live to the north of us as to exactly what we intend to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been in this shadow portfolio for the environment and heritage for only a few days. I have talked to a few people, and the overwhelming view that has been put to me is that, despite all the rhetoric and all the money, we have had an awful lot of froth and not much bubble. People are saying to me that the programs are not delivering. Although I admit that there is a lot of excitement and a lot of anticipation and a lot of involvement by people on the ground in the landcare program, overwhelmingly people who are involved in that program&mdash;and the NFF has said so publicly in recent days&mdash;say that those programs are not delivering the required environmental resuscitation or improvement of Australia. In fact, on the ground, they are not working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give some examples. On soil erosion, CSIRO's calculations of the amount of lift-off of dust and soil in the last few days are mind boggling. For things like greenhouse gases, urban pollution, urban waste disposal, endangered species exports and feral animal control, the programs are just a joke. Feral animals are out of control in this country. Weed control is also out of control. For the reduction of salinity and for the above ground watertables which are rising all over this country and causing enormous troubles, these programs are not working. Those are just a few examples of where the government has failed with the landcare program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise the last one, which is probably the biggest in that program, the revegetation program, which is supposed to be the icon of the whole thing&mdash;the billion trees program that Mr Hawke made so much fuss about. I believe we have probably lost a billion trees in the time since he announced it and we are about square at best. That is no performance for a government which has made a big thing of these rather glamorous areas of environment, and I will be looking forward to making sure that, in the small time that it has left, it does a better job than it has done up till now. There is no incentive in this country to invest. You only have to look at the figures and you will find that business is not investing, and that is why this budget will be a failure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with a great deal of pride that I rise to support the budget, because we on this side have taken note of the supportive statements of all areas of the Australian community about our budgetary strategy. I would like to suggest that that applies to all of them with one exception, because I notice that on 13 May in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> the headline was `Budget Won't Help Jobless: Hewson'. It certainly would appear that it rendered him jobless and gave the opportunity to a few other unemployables to obtain a job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I intend to support this budget by describing the ways in which it will help the people of my electorate. The people of the Paterson electorate represent the average Aussie. There is a growing retirement population but there are also many young families, just as in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker. But there are also many unemployed, far too many, who have been affected by the restructuring of industry and the advances of technology. The Paterson electorate therefore is a microcosm of regional Australia. Most of its residents want to live along the coastal fringe, where tourism is a major industry. Most people are employed in small business. It offers a high standard of educational facilities, it has a farming and forestry industry, and its commercial centre is active and progressive. There are many regional areas all over Australia like the one that I am proud to represent, and I venture to say that they are the heartland of Australian values and attitudes. So, if this government has formulated a budget which offers something to the people of Paterson, it has offered something to the whole of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say straight off that the government has approached this budget in a totally innovative way. It is not cast along the traditional lines of cut here and spend there; it is quite a different kind of budget. It has been formulated in a climate where economic growth is running at five per cent of GDP and inflation is at a low two per cent, with exports continually growing. These are not our traditional exports, of course; they are new exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget has been built upon the guiding principles and policies of the white paper, and this is the document which I believe will go down in history as one of the great manifestos of a nation emerging from difficult times of recession to take up opportunities for economic growth that are unprecedented in modern times. The great thing about our budget is that we are not talking about economic statements; we are laying down a framework for what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has described, and quite correctly, as a dynamic social democracy. There is no point in being the richest nation on earth if this wealth is not shared by all, if there is no social cohesion, no community sense of belonging. I support this budget because it offers those opportunities to the people of my electorate to share in the times ahead, to make the most of our resources and to maintain the increase in our standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of the significant aspects of our budget. As the representative of a regional area, I applaud the initiatives that will allow regions to set their own agendas and to determine their own futures. This is certainly an awesome responsibility but the government, of course, is going to help them. One hundred and fifty million dollars will go towards a national regional development strategy. The people of the Hunter region, like others around Australia, will be able to work in partnership with their local councils, with the state government and with the federal government to increase the financing options for business, facilitating infrastructure investment, encouraging best practice, promoting export activity and improving program delivery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regional infrastructure fund of $70 million offers exciting opportunities for local communities to develop projects that will result in greater productivity. The $80 million regional best practice program will give regions of strong growth like the Hunter the opportunity to foster development organisations, fund the implementation of regional action plans and share their strategic vision with other regions. I want to see my area take the opportunity that is offered in this budget to get assistance and support to become a major player in the export business, and it is already happening, with small producers realising they can benefit by focusing on Asian markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to speak more about individuals, the families, the small business people, the elderly, the sick, our veteran community and, more important than any others, the unemployed, and to talk about just how they are going to benefit under this budget strategy. It would perhaps be easy in our climate of sustained and high economic growth to forget about those who were made redundant in the restructuring of industry; to forget about the women who have spent the years of their young womanhood in rearing their families but now wish to enter the work force; to forget about the young school leavers who have no skills for the highly trained work force that is required by today's commercial world. A government which bases its budget on principles of economic rationalisation would probably say, `Let's cut our losses. Let's put our money into those who can produce quick profits and get their own skills without government help.' But thank goodness we on this side of the House are not governed by those principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget puts in place the goals of the white paper to integrate the long-term unemployed back into the labour force and ensure that there are skills necessary for economic growth. Unemployed people throughout Australia will have the opportunity to gain entry level training places provided by the budget&mdash;an extra 50,000 places per year. We have taken the sensible approach with these additional places, and they will be created by expanding traditional apprenticeships and traineeships as well as creating new ones in areas such as environment and community services. Areas such as the Hunter will be winners in this strategy. We have training facilities such as Maitland Skillshare, Hunter Valley Training Company and skillshares in the Port Stephens and Gloucester areas which have an excellent reputation for achieving successful job outcomes. The introduction of the training wage complements this initiative, and employers in my electorate will be fully briefed on the way in which they can participate in the training of our currently unemployed young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fitting that in the International Year of the Family the government has seen fit to put in the budget initiatives that will benefit the families of Australia. The introduction of a parenting allowance at a cost of $1.2 billion over four years will benefit the spouses of unemployed and those on low incomes. Only yesterday we heard the announcement of a maternity allowance, and this now puts us on an equal footing with other OECD countries in recognising the needs of families for the first 12 weeks of the life of a baby. To respond to the needs of working parents, 25,000 new child-care places are expected to become operational during 1994-95 alone. These initiatives complement the child-care cash rebate to be introduced in one month's time. There has been tremendous support for this initiative in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also commend to this House the allocation of $9 million during 1995, targeting the literacy and numeracy needs of very young children, and the budget boost for Asian languages and cultural awareness. The commitment of $48 million is extremely important, because it recognises our national strategy of developing closer links with our Asian neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise that this is not an ad hoc, knee-jerk budget. As well as implementing the initiatives of the white paper, it builds on existing planning. I refer, in particular, to the national mental health strategy. The budget more than doubles the funding to deliver mental health services in Australia. It will see $12.3 million go to establish psycho-geriatric units within aged care assessment teams and $22.8 million go to the continuation of vocational rehabilitation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The women in my electorate, like the women all over Australia, will also welcome the focus that this budget has been given to their needs. Women want to participate in the work force in increasing numbers. I believe that no country can afford to ignore the talents and skills of half its population. There will be increased access for women to job training programs, and help in starting their own businesses. This will be of particular benefit to those women who have been outside the work force for some considerable time, rearing their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The health of women is also of particular interest and is being targeted with a major attack on breast cancer. An extra $14 million will be spent on screening during 1994-95. Special attention will be given to issues of quality control, the recruitment and training of staff, and the monitoring and reporting of results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has implemented a national women's health strategy, which I am very interested in seeing achieved through the initiatives of this budget. I believe that health is a major concern of women. They are generally the primary carers of children and of the aged. They are often the ones who make the decisions about health services, about choices and about treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They will welcome the government's reaffirming its commitment to Medicare and the allocation of funds so that every Australian will have access to affordable health care. Multipurpose services have proved very successful in providing health and aged care, and the budget doubles the reach of this program in small and remote communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget has also been welcomed by veterans in my electorate. The initiatives were carefully developed, and address the most pressing needs of our ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen, war widows and widowers and their dependants. These will be enshrined in the Veterans' Entitlements Act, providing a better pension deal for merchant mariners, widows, widowers and separated partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget measures have also taken into account the constructive suggestions of the advisory council on veterans' issues, so changes will address health care, compensation and income support to ensure that changing needs are met and equity is ensured. An $8.9 million boost to aged care over the next four years will help veterans and war widows remain healthy and self-sufficient in their own homes and within their own local communities for as long as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a representative of the many people in my electorate who are concerned about the deterioration of our environment, I am particularly pleased with the work opportunities that will be provided by the regional environment employment program. This will support regional consortiums of community groups, landcare groups, government and business to provide work experience and training in strategic environmental management and restoration projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tourism is a major contributor to the economy in my electorate and in the electorates of other honourable members and has already benefited from the initiatives of this government. I am pleased that these initiatives will be enhanced. I know there are many other people in my electorate who will benefit from this year's budget. Time prevents full itemisation but they include people such as those with a disability, who will be given employment assistance, and the farmers in my electorate, who will benefit from a $70 million package and the $250 million that will go to the rural adjustment scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate that there are many others who wish to support this budget, so I will curtail my statements. It certainly gives me great pleasure to support not simply a budget that is a statement of economic rationalism but a budget that shows the very human face of a government that cares about people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday's euphoric media circus by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Willis) about the quarterly numbers and the five per cent GDP growth needs to be put in a truer context of the white paper and the budget predictions. Of course, all Australians should welcome sustained growth of that magnitude, and a very low annual inflation rate. Let us just have a look at what this morning's dailies had to say on some of those numbers. First of all, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . despite all the federal government crowing about the March quarter statistics, without a sharper and much faster budget deficit-reduction program, Australia inevitably would return to higher interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the fundamental political and economic issue facing the government was to create lots of jobs, real jobs, very quickly.</PARA>
<PARA>The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The level of national savings was the one element of the national accounts figures that was a potential shoal under which the recovery could falter . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unless the challenge is met, the good news could be swamped by a calamitous blow-out in the balance of payments deficit. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the economic figures showed the recovery was booming but raised questions about the government's ability to achieve its long-term growth targets.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The figures showed consumption and housing investment continued to propel the recovery, but business investment was slow in coming and threatened to put pressure on the government's fiscal policy . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The safest conclusion to draw from yesterday's heart-stopping national accounts figures is that the economy is still on a path of strong, non-inflationary growth but with no evidence yet of the business investment that will be needed to keep the recovery going.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us not forget that budget forecast of a 14.5 per cent increase in business investment. Informed economic observers are still predicting about half of that figure. On that point, of course, the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) yesterday continued to play a straight bat, maintaining simply that the level of business investment was on course. There is little doubt, therefore, that the budget is built on moving sand of questionable quality, the direction and magnitude of which remains a big question mark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indisputably, it is a tax and spend budget, with little expenditure restraint and with the overall tax burden on ordinary Australians continuing to rise. For example, in PAYE personal tax and sales tax, we see an increase of about eight per cent. In tax on superannuation funds we see a 27 per cent increase. In receipts from fringe benefits tax we see an astronomical 130 per cent rise and, finally, in relation to that milch-cow petrol excise, we see further increases of 13 per cent. It is a budget that will blow out public sector debt and will lead to rising interest rates&mdash;another point, of course, on which the Treasurer remains non-committal, hedging his bets in the last 24 hours and refusing to rule out such a trend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper and its grandiose schemes, on the other hand, are likely to move over 100,000 people from the official unemployment statistics over the next 12 months. That may give the government a warm inner glow, albeit a dishonest one, but it simply means that those people will not have real jobs. The government will thus add substance to the widely held views that we are perpetuating an environment in which we have one of the most highly educated and trained unemployed sectors in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nor should we lose sight of the longer standing social and economic settings created by this government and into which the white paper and budget fit. Australians should remember, firstly, that real wages have declined for low and middle income earners during the 11 years of Labor government. Secondly, the overall tax burden has increased, and increased substantially. Thirdly, over the same period, there has been an almost threefold increase in the number of people unemployed for more than two years and, of course, there is a disastrous situation in terms of opportunities for our 15- to 19-year-olds. At the same time, the national debt has deteriorated to disastrous levels by about 600 per cent and, for every Australian, we now have about $10,000 of foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we now have a more unequal Australia. The top 10 per cent of income earners have benefited by about seven per cent since 1983, while the bottom 10 per cent have suffered a real wage reduction of five per cent. So much for the social justice policies of the Australian Labor Party for its traditional electoral support base. This budget and white paper are demonstrably high on rhetoric but low on substance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning in the short time available to me this afternoon to some of the specifics, I want to raise briefly a number of issues. The first relates to rural provincial Australia. Once again this budget bashes the bush, and people on farms continue to be the forgotten people. Yesterday in this place, during question time, we heard the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) suggest that the rural adjustment scheme was the panacea for rural people's ills. Shortly afterwards, the Deputy Leader of the National Party (Mr Anderson) made a comment in a press release. I entirely agree with what he said, and I quote it in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Maybe Mr Beddall and the other Government Ministers should meet with the thousands of farmers who have been refused assistance through the so called "normal" RAS.</PARA>
<PARA>Normal RAS is open only to those farmers who are expanding or undertaking some other program to improve their productivity. The money is not available to the battler who just wants a hand to survive. I agree with that. It seems to me that the rural adjustment scheme is putting the emphasis in the wrong place. It has, for a number of years now, continued to put emphasis on getting people off farm rather than providing an environment, through taxation and other initiatives, to keep them producing on farm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, that leads to another issue relevant to RAS: the continuing problem of drought. Drought conditions are continuing in New South Wales and southern Queensland. Unless my area gets rain in the next couple of weeks, there will be no winter crop on the Darling Downs, and the vegetable farmers in the Lockyer Valley will be in deep trouble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise that with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) at the table and with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, in particular. The minister should note that the rural adjustment scheme is not going to be sufficient unless the weather improves, and improves dramatically, in the next few weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to now turn quickly to road funding. While the government's grab for fuel excise has climbed to an estimated $9.7 billion for 1994-95, an increase of 13.2 per cent over the 1993-94 level, its road funding has fallen from a little over $1 billion in 1993-94 to $820 million in 1994-95, a cut of almost 20 per cent. As a result, federal road funding has been halved over the last two years with its commendable black spot program&mdash;I am sure the Deputy Speaker would agree with me on this&mdash;one of its budgetary casualties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have only to point out to those in this House that, for every $500,000 spent on the black spot program, one life was saved. Every road fatality costs Australia over $600,000. The black spot program is estimated to have saved over 500 lives and so saved Australia over $300 million. That program cost only $270 million, yet we find that the Keating government terminated it in June last year. In relation to fuel excise, to quote the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp), the government has turned petrol bowser banditry into an art form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To mention a couple of figures very quickly, in 1981-82 when road funding was $685 million excise was at $970 million and road funds as a percentage of excise were a little over 70 per cent. By 1987-88, when $1.2 billion was spent on roads, $5.4 billion was received in excise. The percentage had fallen to 22.9 per cent. Next year, when $820 million will be spent on the roads, it is expected that $9.7 billion will be returned in excise. In other words, road funding as a percentage of excise will be down to a disastrous 8.45 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to take up any more of the House's time&mdash;a lot of other people want to speak&mdash;but let me say finally that this budget is one of huff and puff and it will again demonstrate the enduring characteristics of this government. The parliamentary secretary can smile but&mdash;wait for this&mdash;those characteristics are its failure to match its rhetoric with substance and its predilection for political deceit and the art of the untruth. This budget is an expensive non-event. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am speaking in support of the appropriation bills. The message that I put out to my electorate was a truthful message in that I said it is a good news budget. It is a good budget for Australia mainly because there are no new taxes and no increases of tax rates, and no matter how long they harp and go on about it that is the reality. The Australian economy is growing strongly and this will produce jobs. The budget is good for business as Australia will remain one of the lowest taxed countries in the industrial world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this the International Year of the Family, a parenting allowance recognises the needs of low income earners. Child vaccination will save lives; women's breast cancer is addressed; health expenditure is increased for everyone; and a reduction in the price of heating oil and kerosene will be welcomed this winter by many working families. Veterans, the environment and the Olympics are all winners in this budget. This budget represents good, responsible government and it is fair. Good news is always welcome. Therefore, I say that this House should welcome this budget and those opposite should welcome the good news that it brings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget that was brought in by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) was brought in with another paper entitled Working Nation. The latter paper is often referred to as the white paper on employment and growth. The white paper on employment and growth did a number of major things and it is integral to the budget strategy of this government. Figures in Working Nation show that, in the first full year of its operation, 1995-96, the measures will add $1.7 billion to the Commonwealth's outlays. Over four years, outlays will be $6.5 billion, more than previous projections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1995-96 the increase will comprise $2.1 billion on employment and training, partly offset by savings of some $800 million in unemployment allowances; new income support measures of $280 million; industry, science and trade initiatives of $160 million; and specific regional development programs of $50 million. I would like to address that last one later, if I have some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To go ahead with the policies, the policies for employment and growth first off revolved around reform of labour market assistance. Under the job compact, people who have been receiving unemployment allowances for 18 months or more will be assisted in the following ways: individual case management, training and support to ensure that they are job ready and a job for six to 12 months, primarily in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some opposition members keep calling for the federal government to produce jobs. I can understand why the agrarian socialists might do that, having common ground. But how do we create jobs? If you are advocating, as I do, that there should be a higher level of public ownership in GDP, please say it. Then we can have more Commonwealth public servants. If you want more Commonwealth public servants, ask for them. Do not whinge about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To go on about this job compact, for some clients there will be a training wage, so the job is combined with training leading to recognised and transferable skills; new work opportunities which will encourage local proposals for employment generation, especially in regions where employment opportunities are limited; intensive job search assistance; and referral to suitable vacancies at the end of the job compact placement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The paper then goes on to training, education and reform. There are specific measures designed to look at the entry level of training measures, and a revised incentive structure to encourage employers to take on apprenticeships and trainees. The new rates will, in most cases, maintain or increase employer payments from the current high levels introduced during the recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be a new training wage to simplify industrial relations arrangements for the trainees, three new training paths, and student traineeships to enable years 11 and 12 students to combine their studies with work experience and off-the-job training. I understand about that, having formerly been a teacher in a school where we experienced 56 per cent youth unemployment. So I understand and appreciate it, and congratulate the government on that move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Enterprise traineeships will enable large enterprises to undertake their own traineeships. BHP, a local producer in our area, is one such enterprise. Labour market program traineeships will enable participants in the labour market programs to go on recognised training. There will also be an expansion of traineeships to include adults for the first time, and development&mdash;in conjunction with the states and territories&mdash;of a broad set of principles to increase industry's role in the national training system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The youth training initiative was brought forward. Under this youth training initiative, young people will receive intensive case management, with an initial comprehensive assessment of skills and of knowledge in key areas. All unemployed people under the age of 18 will have the assistance of a specific case manager in their search for a suitable work, training or education placement. The number of labour market and vocational training places available for young people will be doubled. There will be job search assistance and new income support arrangements to encourage young people to stay in education or training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the white paper there have been a significant number of social security reforms. The parenting allowance complements the government's other family payments. Take the example of a family with two children, where the husband has a job in the metal industry, earning $320 a week, and the wife is at home caring for the children. With the introduction of the parenting allowance, the wife will receive $156 a week in direct payments from the government, composed of the parenting allowance of $70 and family payments of $86. If the family were renting privately, the wife would receive an additional $38 a week. I would suggest that those people within my electorate will, on seeing and receiving these benefits, come up with one statement which is very commonly heard around the traps now: `Thank you, Mr Keating. Thank you.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the main income support changes that have been done under the Working Nation paper, the social security reform and the major reform package from 1 July 1995, the spouses of the unemployed will receive individual payments. That is a major advance. A parenting allowance will be introduced. The partner allowance will continue for those spouses who cannot reasonably be expected to actively seek work. The standard allowance income test will be modified to replace the dollar for dollar withdrawal rate with a 70 per cent rate. If the opposition wants incentives to get people to work, there is the answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The income test for couples will be modified so that it is largely based on the individual's income, with a spouse income test only applied where the partner has an income of over $230 a week. Unemployed people will also be able to undertake a broader range of activities useful to their re-employment and still retain their eligibility for jobsearch and the newstart allowance. This has been a major thing which has come through my electorate. I am grateful that the government has listened when I have made repeated representations on this issue. And the people in my electorate will understand and will recognise themselves in what I say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of regional development, a number of things have been done by the government, and a whole raft of packages has been put together through the regional economic development organisations, in such a way that we have regional development here which is going to be sensible, sane, and have a result. There has been a lot of talk about economic development and regional development in the past, but one has to go back to the glorious days of E.G. Whitlam to see where there was anything meaningful first put into them. Under the Department of Urban and Regional Development&mdash;DURD, as it was called; although it was called other things by its detractors&mdash;there was, under Professor Logan, a real scientific look at the way that we look at our regions. It is a very important thing. </PARA>

The honourable member is not only a good bloke, a nice individual, and someone who loves his family&mdash;which is important in this International Year of the Family&mdash;but also a very able administrator. And he has one special quality which makes him stand out in any crowd: he is a man of vision. He is a man who can see into the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very senior government member&mdash;the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) no less&mdash;said recently that a number of components were required for regional development. The first was vision. The second was the ability to facilitate it. The third was having the guts to do it. All these qualities exist in the honourable member for the Northern Territory and through his capabilities he has achieved much in that portfolio. I would like to thank him for what he has done in my area of Gilmore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently received a letter from Mr Ian Strathie, a member of the Chamber of Commerce in Nowra. He was commenting on the fact that Jervis Bay did not get the armaments depot. He was saying, `Oh woe, this is abysmal. The whole of your electorate is going to fall into an abyss. Nothing is going to happen. It is all gone.' From the arguments that this man put forward, I thought I was in China. I thought I was in Beijing listening to the comrades bitching about not getting the Olympic Games and saying, `Oh, it did not come to us. We did not get it. It was stolen off us.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will make a few points about the armaments depot. West Point Wilson has had an armaments depot on the wharf for well over 80 years. The only reason that Jervis Bay was ever put on the list and even considered was because Coode Island in the western part of Melbourne blew up and commitments were made to move the armaments depot. West Point Wilson was chosen. There was a conflict about whether the two could collocate. If that had not been the case, West Point Wilson would have been first, last and always the choice for a lot of reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the people around my area who are whingeing about having lost something, having had something taken away from them, have to realise that you have to have something before you can lose it. We never had it. That is the reality. I do not intend to sit there and moan and whinge about it. I intend to go forward. I intend to do some positive things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What have I done already? Firstly, with the assistance of the councils and tourist operators, we went out and won the right to stage the RTA great New South Wales bike ride. So 2,000 people and over $600,000 worth of spending will come to my electorate. All my punters and small business people know the value of that. Only yesterday, I announced the first economic advantages for my area. What were they? The printing contracts are being tendered through our area. There is over $600,000 to $700,000 worth of contracts that are going to go through my area because of my work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there has been a great storm down our way over ocean outfall of sewage. Yes, we are talking about `it'. As a surfer, I went on the attack. As a surfer, I do not want to swim in `it'. The members of the fishing industry on the coast who sell to Japan and Korea know that their industry could be devastated by this. Further, mariculture is a growing industry in my area. Are the Japanese and the Koreans going to want scallops and other seafood grown in `it'? No!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were some strategic, important reasons why in fact that should be stopped. I was hammered. I was called everything. Now they have changed their tune. They have changed tune because I was proved to be right. Wollongong University found that 76 per cent of people were against it, 72 per cent of people were prepared to pay more to stop ocean outfall, and 56 per cent of people were prepared to pay up to five bucks a week to stop it. I went to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the member for the Northern Territory, and I said, `Look, there is a big training potential here. We have, through DEET in Wollongong, been able to set up a feasibility study to introduce the forestry industry through my area.' I would add that the forestry industry has been there for a long while, but the depletion of the available stock is such that the forestry industry has been in wind-down for some considerable time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I do not want in my electorate is the warfare that is going on in Eden-Monaro and the south-east forests. I do not want contractors having their plant and equipment out in the forest destroyed. I do not want to see environmentalists injured and putting their lives on the line. There is a way of avoiding that. When I put forward my proposals to the parliamentary secretary, as a man of vision he assisted by directing me how to go about putting it up. What we have now got is a feasibility study which will mean, if all comes to fruition, a plantation industry along our coasts, using the effluent water in a positive way. For the people of Shoalhaven that will mean that, rather than throwing money into the till every year to pay for their effluent disposal, 20 years down the track they are going to actually get some returns from this timber. That is one of the visions that I have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will turn to the tourist industry in the few minutes that I have left. I have commissioned out of my own funds a study of ecotourism in the Moreton National Park, which takes up two-thirds of my electorate.

Can I suggest to the parliamentary secretary in this very public way that my region should be linked to Canberra, because our tourist potential through main road 92 and infrastructure development, which was referred to in Working Nation, will be the ideal joining link. Tourists coming through from Canberra can open up my coast, can provide employment to the 15 per cent of kids in my area who are unemployed. Canberra needs a manufacturing base. We in the Shoalhaven and Kiama and the Wingecarribee council area can provide that. That is where our connection should go through. In our regional development study what we should be doing is targeting for the Olympics so that we have a combined approach. I am calling a seminar at the end of this year.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can I say at the outset that unquestionably all of us welcome an apparent pick-up in economic activity and the prospect of easier times and, hopefully, a better jobs outlook for Australians, both those in work, perhaps worrying about what their future might be, and those who are out of work now or who will be looking for jobs in the next few years. It would be churlish to want to downplay the importance and the welcome nature of the pick-up that we are seeing. But the great trick is to ensure that the recovery is sustained, that it is built on a solid platform, on solid foundations, that it is not going to prove either illusory in the sense that it will not last or, worse, simply be part of the re-emergence of a boom and bust cycle, which has become so much a feature of Australian life and which has done so much damage to our social and economic fabric. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that it is in this area of the sustainability of the recovery that questions have to be put to the government about whether or not it really has put in place the structural reforms and policy initiatives that will guarantee that the recovery stays on track and that it builds up pace and builds up quality. Essentially, the debate must now centre on the quality of the recovery and whether or not it can be locked in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset I turn my attention to my area of essential interest and responsibility in this place: the farm sector. I note with enormous relief that it has managed to put in a very sound performance over the last little while and that that sound performance has made an enormous contribution to the growth figures that we saw yesterday. Having done so, I would then like to look at why the recovery in my view may not be sustainable, very largely because of government policy, and why certain aspects of government policy are not only wrong but ought to be changed in the interests of all Australians and, perhaps most of all, in the interests of those the government purports to represent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned, farming has made and is making an outstanding contribution to economic recovery, despite the extraordinarily different circumstances that the sector has been through in recent times. The farm sector still provides, as honourable members know, about a third of Australia's export wealth; it provides employment for some 450,000 Australians, directly and indirectly; it also provides&mdash;and this is not often recognised&mdash;the raw material for Australia's major manufacturing industry, which is food processing. So no-one should underestimate the importance of the farm sector to our nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been through difficult times, however. We have had very high interest rates, at over 20 per cent for a period of in excess of 18 months, not long ago during the recession that we were told we had to have. In fact, they are still in real terms extremely high by international standards, unacceptably and uncompetitively high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a series of very difficult seasonal circumstances and, unfortunately, we are seeing drought re-emerging across much of the continent even as I speak here today. We have seen very low prices, largely as a result of international trade distortions brought about by the activities of the Europeans and the Americans; and we have seen years of very high inflation arising out of the inadequacies of domestic policy, particularly over the last 11 or 12 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite that, we are now seeing a turnaround, and total farm output by value has increased by some 9.7 per cent on an annualised basis. In the March quarter, agricultural yield rose by some 4.4 per cent, contributing 0.2 per cent of a total 1.9 per cent growth that we heard about yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major contributions to this improved performance came from several sectors of primary industry: for example, a near record wheat crop last year of some 18.2 million tonnes has stood us in very good stead indeed. In fact, that compares with our biggest crop ever in a not altogether unfavourable way. In 1983-84 we stripped some 23 billion tonnes of wheat in this country. There are quite a few people in the gallery today, and they might like to know that the Australian population is some 17 million people but that Australia's farmers produce enough food for 55 million people. That is why it is such an important export performer: we are able to export a great deal of surplus because we do not consume a great deal of our own production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our barley crop last year was also very significant: 9.7 million tonnes. Sugar is an industry which is doing significantly better in recent times. In Queensland, the Chairman of the Canegrowers Association, Harry Bonanno, has pointed out that prices and yields have been good after the drought year which knocked things around a couple of years ago. Last year the yield was 4.4 million tonnes, a big improvement and very welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dairy industry is doing extremely well, spearheading a major export drive into Asia. It is our biggest single value-added sector in the primary industries, and an industry which is really setting the pace, if you like, far outstripping the productivity and export performance improvements of almost every other industry in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wool is making a much vaunted and very welcome recovery. We are now seeing the market indicator well in excess of 600c and, after three years of disastrous losses by the rural sector, that is welcome. Likewise, the outlook for beef, which is now our biggest export rural industry, is better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I do not want to paint too rosy a picture. It is by no means a case of `Let us go and buy a new Mercedes Benz' out in the bush; it is better than it has been. Let us hope it stays that way, and I confess to a vested interest in this. I am relieved to see it turning around because I have a farming background. Farmining is an industry I am committed to remaining in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to raise some very serious issues that relate to this budget and to related government policy. To put it very simply, the budget grabs too much of what is called the growth dividend; it assumes too much about the actuality of the growth dividend. It is a little akin to going out and spending the money in anticipation of having it rather than waiting until it really does flow. In fact, the budget threatens to cut growth off at the knees, particularly in the rural export sector, because of the risk of increases in inflation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that everybody is saying that there are no indications of a re-emergence of inflation, and I will come back to that view shortly. Modest inflation rises are predicted in the budget, as are resulting modest increases in interest rates. Together those would push the dollar up to levels higher than would otherwise be the case. In fact, it ought to be noted that since the ABARE outlook conference earlier this year, which predicted an Australian dollar value of about $US0.71, the increase in the value of the dollar since has already wiped $300 million or $400 million off farm sector receipts for this 12-month period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned, the budget policy is linked to other policies, particularly industrial relations, which, in my view, seriously threaten investment confidence in this nation. As well, in an environment where we face these problems, it is extraordinary to me that research and development funding is being cut, particularly in the CSIRO and its rural divisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The growth dividend issue presupposes that there will be a massive surge in investment in this country. I suggest that despite some evidence that there is a surge in investment it is not happening in the right areas. The figures released yesterday are boosted very significantly not only by some one-off factors, which are not likely to be repeated, but also by a huge and very worrying surge in public sector consumption spending as well as a significant increase in private sector&mdash;as opposed to business&mdash;consumption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apparently one commentator this morning made the observation&mdash;I did not hear it, but it was reported to me&mdash;that it was a bit like people being given a shiny new Bankcard and being told that they had a new limit. So out they go on a spending binge on the good life&mdash;wine, women and whatever other delicacies&mdash;with precious little regard for the need for greater investment in plant, equipment and wealth-producing infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The moral of the story is that, in my view and in the view of many commentators, we have not dealt properly with this country's structural productive base and its needs. We are still paying out too much in interest on our debts&mdash;our accumulating debts because we go on spending&mdash;yet we want to pretend that it does not matter, that somehow the good times are here again, and that we can all go back to sleep and adopt the old Australian attitude of `She'll be right, mate.' I do not believe that that is an appropriate attitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was going to abide by the convention that we speak only for 10 minutes, but I assume that it is probably best not to clutter up the issue now, so I will continue for a little longer. I am not convinced by any means that we have defeated the inflationary pressures in this country. Inflation has been low essentially because the economy was driven into recession. The economy has been comatose, and that condition has seen massive asset deflation and discounting that have given us a very low inflation figure. Nobody could argue more than I would that a low inflationary outcome is always desirable, but I do not believe that the essential causes of inflationary pressures in the economy have been properly dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one accepts the textbook analysis or description of what causes inflation, we have a situation of too much demand chasing too few goods, or production unable to keep up with demand. The question has to be asked: if we get an enormous surge in demand of the sort that we had in the late 1980s, will the capacity to meet it be there, or will imports simply start to surge, necessitating&mdash;given the government's absence or inability to use other management tools&mdash;an interest rate hike to dampen things down?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality has to be faced that, despite the talk about enterprise agreements being widespread now, we really are still lagging in the productivity improvement stakes not only in terms of competition with or comparison against other OECD countries but also, more particularly, in terms of the way that we relate to improving productivity in Asia. The fact remains that our industrial relations system still puts disincentives and obstacles in the way of more flexible workplaces. The real question about enterprise agreements and enterprise bargaining in this country&mdash;and we have heard a lot of debate on that subject in this place in the last couple of days, and all this talk about how 48 per cent of people under federal award coverage now work under enterprise agreements&mdash;has to be asked: how good is the quality of those enterprise agreements? When we look at our productivity improvement, we see the evidence that they are not particularly good is pretty clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point, given that I have not got much time, I want to refer to an article that appeared in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, which illustrates the point that I am making. It is headed `Processed-food industry faces Asian challenge'. It says that a survey undertaken by the consultants Towers Perrin found that we `will miss out on lucrative Asian markets unless changes to work practices and employee-reward structures are made'. The article said that the Australian food processing industry:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . could not rival overseas industries on cost, had inflexible and restrictive work practices and that most companies had achieved only marginal productivity increases in the past two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A human resources consultant with Towers Perrin . . . said that while companies had acknowledged that changes were needed, most had done nothing about it.</PARA>
<PARA>The consultant went on to say that, whereas Asia is expected to be a huge growth market for Australia, if Australia is not careful `the thing could be turned around, and Australia could become a huge growth market for Asia'. That is a preposterous suggestion. That this country could become a major growth market for processed foodstuffs, when we ought to be the springboard for exports into Asia, is a total absurdity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that spending is too high and taxes remain too high, yet at the same time we go further into debt. The real dangers&mdash;higher interest rates, driving a higher than is necessary or desirable dollar, coupled again with drought encroaching across the continent&mdash;offer the possibility of a real negative impact on recovery. The government remains culpable, not just for not properly allowing for these outcomes and possibilities but also for wanting to snaffle the benefits without properly allowing for the unseeable and for the possibility of downturns in climatic conditions and what have you. It in fact increases the probability that rural Australia will simply not be able to make the contribution that the budget so confidently predicts will be made towards the Australian economy's return to prosperity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was very happy to be able, with the Treasurer, to report that the government had again made another agreement with the ACTU under accord mark 7, which now extends into 11 years the effective operation of the accord. As a consequence, Australia will again have moderate wage outcomes and the maintenance of low inflation over the next two years. This coming on a day when the national accounts record five per cent economic growth, the non-farm GDP deflator at 0.7 of a per cent for the year and the private consumption deflator at 1.7 per cent means that we have seen inflation actually decelerate in the face of very strong economic growth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It gives the government great pleasure to be able to record yesterday that the ACTU and its constituent members have agreed with the government on a safety net adjustment of $8 for those people who now cannot secure a wage increase by enterprise bargaining and who otherwise would need to wait on some centralised adjustment. That commitment and the reaffirmation of wage outcomes consistent with our trading partners' inflation rate are something which I think all Australians should welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence, the accord has delivered over this 11 years a 10 1/2 per cent reduction in real non-farm unit labour costs since 1983, record profits, low inflation, industrial harmony&mdash;the number of working days lost per 1,000 employees through industrial disputes is the lowest it has been in more than 30 years&mdash;and 236,000 jobs over the past year. As a consequence, yesterday the government again supported the notion of a safety net to protect lower paid workers. Those safety nets are about maintaining equity in a more flexible wages system, something the opposition has no concept of. The ACTU and the government agreed to support before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission two $8 safety net wage adjustments. Yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition was asked about this matter:</PARA>

<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, no. I absolutely didn't say that at all. I am not arguing that low income Australians aren't entitled to a wage increase. The $8 figure for low income people, to give them some sort of hope of at least sustaining their living standards, is, you know, the figure that's been announced today and I'm not criticising that.</PARA>
<PARA>But the point that seems to have escaped the Leader of the Opposition is that the $8 only turns up by virtue of the safety net adjustments under the accord process&mdash;no safety net, no $8. And the opposition is opposed to a safety net. It is opposed to the notion of a system of wage fixation in this respect. It disparaged accord mark 7 when it came out&mdash;</PARA>

So him saying `Okay; I am not cavilling at $8' does not mean that he would have the wage system the government has, because he rejects the whole notion of a safety net for low paid people and he rejects the notion of the kind of enterprise bargaining system which the government has established.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Treasurer. My question refers to yesterday's release of the March quarter national accounts, which show the Australian economy to be growing at five per cent over the last 12 months. Is the Treasurer aware of reports that this is a low quality recovery? Can he advise the House what evidence exists to support such a proposition?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1325" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answer to the honourable member, I can say that I am certainly aware of the comments by the Leader of the Opposition to the effect that this recovery is a low quality recovery. The question asks whether there is any evidence to that effect. Obviously, in the face of the fact that we are growing at five per cent or, at the trend rate, at 4.3 per cent, either way, that growth is as strong or stronger than the growth of any other country in the Western world. That of itself is clearly evidence of a quality recovery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In any case, there is certainly no evidence whatever that this is a low quality recovery. All the evidence is very much the other way. Just let me quickly run through the various factors which demonstrate that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Look at inflation. The Prime Minister has already indicated that inflation is less than one per cent on the GDP deflators. Interest rates are the lowest for 20 years. Employment is growing substantially. Approximately 236,000 jobs have been created in the last 12 months. Profit share is near a record level. It is almost back to the level it was in the mid-1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Productivity is growing very strongly. Yesterday's national accounts show that the trend rate of productivity increase, that is, GDP per hours worked, was 3.6 per cent growth over the last 12 months&mdash;a 3.6 per cent productivity increase. As a result, nominal unit labour costs&mdash;that is, actual labour costs when productivity is taken into account&mdash;are falling. They fell by 0.9 per cent in the March quarter and by 2.4 per cent over the last 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, international competitiveness is improving. We have seen dramatic improvements over our period in office of 30 per cent. Some of that is related to the exchange rate. It is also a fact that falling unit labour costs, relative to those of our major trading partners, are giving us this competitive advantage. That competitive advantage is giving us a terrific export outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Exports over the last 12 months increased in volume terms by just under 12 per cent, or 11.7 per cent. That was partly due to wool and wheat getting a welcome recovery. It was also because of continued strong growth in elaborately transformed manufactures, which grew by 20.7 per cent in the 12 months to March. They have been growing at an average rate of 16 per cent per annum since the mid-1980s. That rate has now moved up to 21 per cent virtually in the last 12 months. Services exports grew by 12 per cent. They have been growing at an average of nine per cent since the mid-1980s. So they are accelerating as well. This is a terrific performance in value added exports. It is coming from our improved international competitiveness, which comes from the very good economic fundamentals which are driving all this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is also a high quality recovery because the government has acted to ensure that the benefits of the recovery are enjoyed by all. The white paper was exactly about that&mdash;ensuring that the disadvantaged in the labour market, particularly the long-term unemployed, got a fair crack at the jobs that were coming through economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister referred in question time earlier today to the accord in terms of yesterday's agreement. That agreement, giving $8 increases for this year and next year, was designed to ensure that wage earners who are not in a position to get a wage increase through enterprise bargaining can still get some wage increase. That means we are ensuring that we do not leave people behind in the process of economic recovery and that the benefits are shared.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite all this, the Leader of the Opposition says that it is a low quality recovery. What is the basis of his argument for that? It is that we do not yet have much happening in the area of business investment. Of course that is true. It is not a unique experience that business investment lags in economic recovery. That is exactly what happened in 1984-85.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1983-84 we had growth of over five per cent and investment fell; in 1984-85 we had further growth of over five per cent and investment grew by 14.9 per cent. So the fact that we can have growth in the early stages without business investment is in no way new. This is what one would expect, particularly in circumstances in which there has been a high amount of excess capacity and balance sheet restructuring going on. Both of those factors are essentially in the past now. Excess capacity is being worked off, and the balance sheet restructuring process has largely passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can now expect that business investment will take off, given that the economic fundamentals are so conducive to it, that the conditions that have held it back in the past are largely in the past, and the fact that there are now also tax inducements to increased investment, which will make it even more attractive. There is $3 billion worth of inducement to increased investment out there at the present time, included amongst which is the investment allowance. To qualify for the investment allowance, businesses have to have their investment committed by the end of this month and in place by the end of June 1995. So there is a major tax inducement for business to get into investment in a big way in 1994-95.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would summarise all this by saying that this is indeed a high quality recovery. The only low quality aspect of this recovery is the standard of the comment on it coming from the opposition.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1326" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BLAXLAND" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, as you know, over a long period of time now, the government has introduced quite path-breaking income support measures for families, the most obvious of which is the family allowance supplement. Beyond that, there has been support for supplementary payments for low paid workers, in the main women in low paid, unskilled jobs, and in other transfer payments, not simply increases in the family allowance, but support for single income families and pensioner families. For those renting privately we have seen support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last election, we announced and have legislated for a generalised child-care rebate. We have introduced and passed legislation for the home child-care allowance, which will be paid directly to the caring spouse from September. We introduced in the white paper the parenting allowance, which will be paid with the home child-care allowance the following year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the same vein in another milestone reform, the government will next year sit down and consider the elements of the design of a maternity payment to assist thousands of Australian families at a time when they most often need it. It will relieve a financial and psychological burden on these families and enable them to better provide the care and encouragement that only families can provide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is probably worth noting that the government has delivered real help to families. We have dramatically increased the value of family payments for low income families&mdash;by nearly 80 per cent for those with younger children and by more than 150 per cent for those with teenagers. We have indexed all family payments for the first time in Australian history. We have funded more than 220,000 child-care places, a five-fold increase. We have introduced, as I said, the generalised child-care rebate and have already legislated for the home child-care rebate. As well, we have introduced the parenting allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said a moment ago in answer to another question, under Labor support for a low income family with two children renting privately has risen by 30 per cent. I reminded the coalition that under its period in government the same family's income fell by two per cent. This year the government will spend over $7 billion&mdash;$7,000 million&mdash;in assistance to Australian families. Crucial to the quality of that expenditure is the fact that the government pays the $7,000 million directly to the parent most involved in the daily care of the children, usually the mother.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, our opponents continue to talk about reversing the policy and introducing income splitting, which would benefit the spouse in employment rather than the spouse caring for children. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said today that the government was trying to get into the field. Can you imagine that? He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it is a strategy to try and pre-empt what is obviously going to be part of a coalition policy; that is, doing something for the families of Australia that feel so squeezed and hard pressed after 10 years of Labor.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a reference to those low income families which will receive nearly 80 per cent more if they have young children and 150 per cent more if they have teenagers. But listen to this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think he is trying to get into the field.</PARA>
<PARA>`He does not know what he is doing; he is trying to get into the field.' It will take more than pathetic utterances like that on radio to indicate other than that all those Australian families which will receive those cheques for $7,000 million will receive that benefit by virtue of the compassion of the Labor Party and its relationship with the ACTU&mdash;the two organisations which have genuinely represented the interests of low paid people in this country. As a consequence, we are very pleased that these continual laminations, layer by layer, of quality in income support for families are such that Australia now has arguably the best family income support system in the OECD area and one that we are determined to continue to improve.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know why the Liberal and National parties hate the FBT so much. We will always remember how back in 1986 they voted against it, turned up at rallies opposing it and put out mischievous information at the time. And nothing has changed. Here we are in 1994 and we are still getting the same sort of interference that we got back then in 1986. The one thing those opposite have not caught up on is the fact that employers are central players in negotiating awards, including the way in which remuneration is paid. Currently, 48 per cent of the work force under federal awards is covered by enterprise agreements. Out of 4,500 awards and agreements, about a dozen refer to the fringe benefits tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Industrial Relations has done his best to try to get those opposite to understand enterprise bargaining. They always talk about enterprise bargaining, but they do not understand it. Because remuneration is a central issue in enterprise agreements between employers and employees, the FBT has, in some cases, already been negotiated out of awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the attention of honourable members to the Professional and Managerial Employees' Federal Enterprise Agreement of 1993. Under the renegotiation of that award, employees can have straight salaries or they can have them made up in fringe benefits&mdash;things like expense accounts, mortgage payments, motor vehicle costs and electricity accounts. They can make up their own minds. But the point is that they can negotiate those awards. They are not Holy Writ. They are not there for all time. Under the enterprise agreements, those things can be taken out of awards. For instance, other awards have provisions in them for a pay rise of two per cent if the fringe benefits tax is cashed out in the future. The point I am making is that the fact that those sorts of things were in awards in the past does not stop fringe benefits from being negotiated out of awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of opposition spokesmen inside and outside of this House have talked down the fringe benefits tax. They have attacked it. They seem to think to do so is a political winner, when all the time the FBT is really making sure that there is equity in the tax system; that people have the opportunity to arrange their affairs so that they can take part of their remuneration in cash and part of it in kind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> If those opposite want to have a look at another package, they can have a look in today's<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>.

They are the sorts of packages we are talking about and they are the sorts of reasons we brought in the fringe benefits tax; to make sure that people like that do not skid through the system and pay tax only on the cash component of their fringe benefits.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also true that we are now seeing some reduction in the level of activity in the housing market.

At the same time, we need to persuade the housing industry of the importance of seeing its market not in the cyclical terms of the past but in terms of the opportunities that exist within our region.

One of the things I thought was noteworthy of yesterday's announcements in respect of the $8 safety net for those who cannot secure it from enterprise bargaining was that only a minority of Australian workers now have their wages adjusted centrally; that is, their wages are adjusted principally through enterprise bargaining, and most employers take the opportunity of securing a productivity benefit.

But debates about problems with unfair dismissals or dismissals&mdash;problems which have been addressed by the government&mdash;have obscured what is underlying it, which is a very large change in the way the nation adjusts wages. It is adjusting wages at a time of accelerating growth with decelerating inflation and high productivity. The other thing is that it is working. We have moved away from a rigid centralised system to a more flexible one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point again that the coalition has always wanted individual wage contracts, not enterprise bargaining, because it does not want a floor under wages. It wants flexibility downwards. We have always said that you cannot secure a productivity benefit simply by dealing with one person.

In the course of that answer he referred to a letter he had received from Mr Rollo Kingsford-Smith, who had served with the bomber command during World War II.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I have a question of you which concerns the availability of copies of the material which is contained in the register of private interests of ministers and parliamentary secretaries. It has been my understanding in the past that these returns have been freely available and printed in the normal numbers, which I understand are 160 for the House, 100 for the Senate, 21 for the Parliamentary Library and 80 for the press gallery. I understand that in the recent batch only five were provided to the Bills and Papers Office, which caters for 146 members of this House. Those members of the press gallery who have been able to access copies have gained access to an extremely limited number and have done so, I am informed, only after a great deal of effort and what might amount to, in some eyes, obstruction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, when the copies have been available they have been available for a limited time through the Bills and Papers Office on condition that original copies be returned.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;On 18 November 1993 the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade tabled the report of its inquiry into Australia's relations with Indonesia. Following earlier reports on the South Pacific and Papua New Guinea, this is the third and final in a series of reports by the committee on Australia's relations with its closest neighbours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report is a comprehensive study of our relations with our most important neighbour. It is the result of more than two years of extensive research and inquiry. It reflects a determination by my parliamentary colleagues to grapple with a complex relationship and identify areas for improvement. The government was pleased to receive it, and to table this detailed response to its specific recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through its work, the committee has highlighted the enormous interest in Indonesia by the Australian community. It has generated public discussion on the many strands in Australia-Indonesia relations and drawn these together in a complete picture of our ties. The government acknowledges, and appreciates, this contribution to public awareness of Australia-Indonesia relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the report demonstrates, Indonesia and Australia enjoy a unique relationship in which each country is profoundly different, but understands the strength of its shared interests with the other. The report acknowledges the importance of this relationship for both countries, strategically and economically. It is an important relationship in its own right and because we are partners in one of the world's most dynamic regions. This partnership is vital to Australia's engagement with, and credibility in, the Asia-Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fully concur with the committee's finding that our relationship with Indonesia is open and positive and in better condition than it has been for some years, but that more can be done to improve it. I agree that this is an important challenge. Australians and Indonesians can and should work together to develop a relationship which goes even further in meeting the needs of both countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indonesia, under President Suharto, has experienced political stability, rapid economic growth, new prosperity for Indonesians, and leadership in international affairs. Recent changes in Australia are no less remarkable. We have had to make our economy more competitive, efficient and skilled. We are realising the full significance of our geography and giving unprecedented attention to the region in which we live. We are discovering the comparative advantage of multiculturalism in our dealings with Asia. We are debating a new sense of national identity and direction. In all these areas, this government has been a driving force for change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Indonesia and Australia redefine their places in the world, particularly in the region, prospects for greater dealings between us become more and more evident. We have a heightened sense of shared interests. Economic reform in both countries has thrown up complementarities stimulating greater commercial dealings. A perception of shared interests beyond the bilateral level is prompting our work together on regional security and prosperity. In short, we are poised to take on new opportunities with Indonesia. The environment is right, and the time is right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government knows that the time is right and has been working towards the challenge. In a few years we have turned perceptions of shared interests into concrete programs for cooperation. We have developed a close rapport at the highest levels with the Indonesian government in a range of fields. Australian and Indonesian ministers are beating an increasingly well-worn path to each other's doors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two governments are developing a solid institutional framework in which to explore ways of delivering long-term benefits. Agreements have been signed on matters as diverse as investment, taxation, copyright, education, customs, development assistance and fisheries cooperation. We are negotiating an agreement on science and technology cooperation. Our officials have regular exchanges in the fields of education, science and technology, health, customs and primary industry, to name just a few examples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australia-Indonesia Ministerial Forum, which is particularly directed at giving government impetus to economic ties, is our most significant bilateral arrangement. Since the establishment of this forum by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and President Suharto in 1992, government and business representatives have regularly met to identify areas for commercial collaboration and to address impediments to trade and investment. Business missions under the aegis of the forum have already resulted in tangible commercial outcomes. We take careful note of the committee's recommendation to exploit fully the potential of this forum, and will be doing our best to take the process forward at the next forum meeting in Canberra in August. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development of these institutional links is not haphazard. We have worked consciously to put them in place and see them as the foundation stones of a stable and enduring relationship. The government welcomes the committee's recognition of their value and its recommendation that they be strengthened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The web of ties is being woven beyond government as well. Australia's business community is becoming engaged in Indonesia at a rate we welcome but would like to see further improved. In five years our exports to Indonesia have trebled to reach $1.8 billion. Within that, manufactures exports have more than trebled to reach $766 million. We are Indonesia's 10th largest source of investment with over 180 Australian companies now operating there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In people-to-people links there is also a quiet revolution under way, again supported by government. The Australia-Indonesia Institute spent over $1 million in 1993-94 on cross-cultural studies and exchanges in the professional, cultural, youth and sports fields. We would welcome closer involvement by the Indonesian government in stimulating ties at this level and wholeheartedly support the committee's recommendation that we encourage Indonesia to establish a counterpart to the Australia-Indonesia Institute. We have been doing just that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We firmly believe in the value of grassroots cooperation and understanding. We have also demonstrated our commitment in this respect by allocating $48 million over the next four years to the study of Asian languages, including Indonesian, in primary and secondary schools through our national Asian languages studies initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The activities I have outlined bring tangible benefits for Australians. They also help cement a bedrock of understanding between the two countries&mdash;an understanding which can be drawn on when dealing with the problems which are bound to arise from time to time. As the committee notes, Australia and Indonesia do not always see eye to eye. Our relationship is not always comfortable and the committee has reported frankly on areas where we have differed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most sensitive area of our relationship is in the field of human rights where we often register our concerns at the highest levels of the Indonesian government. We do not apologise for doing so. As a democratic government we wish, and indeed are obliged, to represent community concerns, including in our foreign policy. But, importantly, we believe that the concerns and issues we raise reflect not just our own values but also those of the entire international community as evidenced in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and related instruments and as recently reaffirmed at last year's Vienna Conference on Human Rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are mindful of the need to ensure that these representations are effective, and we believe they are most likely to be so if Australia is seen as a constructive interlocutor on human rights issues in the context of a strong and broadly based relationship. We share the committee's conclusion that human rights issues should neither be submerged in the relationship nor be allowed to dominate it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia and Indonesia have often found ways creatively to work through difficulties together. The Timor Gap Treaty is an outstanding example of an innovative approach to what seemed an insoluble problem, addressing as it does the issue of undefined boundaries by creating a framework in which we could jointly explore for resources in the Timor Sea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must be similarly creative in those areas of our relationship which need more attention. We still have some way to go, for example, in addressing the problem of illegal fishing. The government appreciates the committee's detailed consideration of fisheries matters and acknowledges its concerns. We support the recommendation to keep the issue of illegal fishing under review. The fisheries cooperation agreement allows us to consult effectively on this and other fisheries matters of common concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has seen for itself the growing knowledge of, and interest in, Indonesia by Australians and that we are poised to enter a new phase in our relations. We can build on our gains so far, and we must take advantage of the momentum for taking forward the relationship which now exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The imperative to strengthen and diversify our commercial ties is foremost. For this reason we are taking government cooperation with business to new levels. Later this month Senator McMullan will lead a mission of up to 250 Australian companies to a business forum in Jakarta, to be opened by the Prime Minister. Participants will discuss Indonesia's trade and investment prospects with an array of Indonesia's most influential business representatives. This is the largest business mission to have travelled overseas from Australia at any one time and its outcome will substantially affect deliberations in Canberra this August on how best to use the Australia-Indonesia Ministerial Forum to advance our commercial agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These commercial objectives will be enhanced by our work with Indonesia on regional economic and trade liberalisation. We will continue to work closely together to ensure the success of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation, APEC, process and do all we can to support Indonesia's chairmanship of APEC this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The security of our regional environment remains a priority and we will be enhancing our engagement with Indonesia on political and security issues in this region. We continue to share a commitment to Cambodia. We need to, and will, talk further about developments in Burma-Myanmar and ways of achieving its more responsible involvement in regional and international affairs. Indonesia is a key player in the regional security dialogue that is now emerging, in particular through the new ASEAN Regional Forum, which we will be attending together when it meets for the first time in Bangkok in July. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on Indonesia was an extremely comprehensive and valuable report on the Australian relationship with Indonesia. The response of the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) today is much less comprehensive and of far less value. I say at the outset that the coalition regards the maintenance of an Australian relationship with Indonesia that is close, broadly based and vibrant as crucial to this country's wellbeing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relationship is crucial in terms of national security, as any significant military threat to Australia would more likely come through&mdash;if not only come through&mdash;the great Indonesian-Melanesian archipelago. It is crucial in terms of our rapidly growing economic links. Trade has expanded nearly threefold in the last five years, and Australia has emerged as a significant investor in Indonesia. The relationship is crucial in terms of the joint management of our common boundary, which stretches from Torres Strait to Christmas Island, and the fisheries and mineral resources in and under the sea along it. The health of the bilateral relationship with Indonesia is a crucial test of our capacity to engage further with Asia in its broadest sense overall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the coalition welcomes the arrangements which have been established recently, such as the Australia-Indonesia Ministerial Forum, to improve and expand the political coordination of the bilateral relationship. Beyond the importance of the key bilateral relationship, Indonesia plays a crucial role in the development of regional institutions, such as APEC and the ASEAN Regional Forum, which bid fair to establish regional relationships on a more cohesive footing than before&mdash;a development stemming from the end of the Cold War. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having agreed with the minister on the significance of the bilateral relationship, I now feel constrained to point out that early in his statement he announced that the government would provide `a detailed response to the report's specific recommendations'. He might have lost some pages out of his speaking notes or maybe his announcement was just another Labor promise for, strain as I did, nowhere in his statement did I hear detailed responses to specific recommendations of the report. This is what these responses are all about. We in the Fraser government introduced them. Committees used to report and the reports would just be filed away. So we determined that we would give executive responses to detailed parliamentary investigations so the public would have the detailed analysis of a parliamentary committee which the executive considered, recommendation by recommendation, and responded to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we heard today was some bland assertion of what we agree is an extraordinarily important relationship. Nowhere did I hear those detailed responses. The minister occasionally alluded to the report's conclusions on issues such as human rights and fisheries, but there was no detailed response to specific recommendations. I will therefore take this opportunity&mdash;and to put it on the record&mdash;to ask the government: precisely what is your detailed response to the sorts of recommendations contained in that very valuable joint committee report?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 3 concerns discussions with regional countries before major defence equipment purchases are finalised. What is the government's response? No response. Recommendation 7 concerns the reopening of the Australian consulate in Dili. What is the government's response? No response. Recommendation 9 concerns compulsory courses on human rights for all officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and AIDAB. What is the government's response? No response. Recommendation 10 concerns human rights assessments of all aid projects that AIDAB undertakes in Indonesia. What is the government's response? No response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 15 concerns fisheries management. Again, no response from the government. Recommendation 27 concerns the possible consequences for the region of a nuclear accident in Indonesia. It is somewhat important to get the government's response to that. What is its response? No response. Recommendation 28 states that the ministerial agreement on science and technology should be debated in both houses of parliament after it is signed. That is a reasonable recommendation, one which should not be too difficult to respond to. A yes or no answer would have been sufficient. There is no response from the government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not a thing. I remind you that these sorts of statements were brought down to give you an indication of the executive's thinking on detailed investigation of particular aspects by parliamentary committees. You come in, respond to them and say what your attitude is to particular recommendations. However, today there has just been a bland enunciation of the depth and warmth of the relationship with Indonesia, with which we concur, but we want to know what the government's response will be to some of those recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another recommendation that I was interested in, although to some this would be more minor, concerns Surabaya, which is a very important site in Indonesia. Recommendation 33 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that an Australian Consulate be opened in Surabaya as a matter of urgency.</PARA>
<PARA>The reason I mention this is that this little consulate has acquired a touch of notoriety of its own. When governments get into trouble, cabinet submissions leak. We read a few months ago in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>&mdash;those of us who are interested in the matter, such as all honourable members in the chamber&mdash;that a cabinet submission, which mysteriously materialised in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> in February, contained a proposal to open this consulate. I would have thought therefore that the minister would have been in some position to respond to this recommendation in the committee's report. Regrettably, just as today mysteriously there was no response to it, the consulate also failed to materialise in the budget. It materialised in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> but not in the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When asked about that matter in a Senate estimates hearing recently, the minister at the time treated the committee to a lecture on government priorities and refused to confirm or deny the proposal. We have had no confirmation or denial today about Surabaya. Perhaps now that the department of foreign affairs has been relieved of its weighty responsibility under the training guarantee levy to expend 1.5 per cent of its overall salary budget on courses, such as assertiveness and team building, funds for the Surabaya consulate may be found. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not talking just about a casual little spot in Indonesia. The Western Australian government already has an office there. The government maintains diplomatic missions in Jakarta and in Bali but Indonesia's and Australia's interests in it range beyond those two centres. Surabaya is Indonesia's second city and the centre of its dynamic East Java region. As I say, the Western Australian government has already established an office there. I ask the minister: when will the federal government follow its lead? I thought today some substance would have been given to the mysterious matter of the Surabaya consulate. Anyhow, I reiterate my call for detailed responses to specific recommendations of the report. I ask the government to treat the committee and its report with the respect it demands and not simply with allusions to rhetoric which we heard today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying that the government has to agree with the recommendations. I am not saying that the coalition would agree with all the recommendations, but they deserve deeper consideration than the recitation of bland generalities that comprised the minister's response. I do agree with the minister's characterisation of human rights as being the most sensitive area of the bilateral relationship. I take this opportunity to reiterate the coalition's policy on such a vital matter. The coalition has consistently deplored violations of human rights in East Timor or wherever they have occurred. The coalition has consistently urged the government to raise Australian concerns on human rights with the Indonesian government and to do all it can to ensure that internationally accepted standards of human rights are observed in East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not believe that the issue of human rights should be confused with that of the province's integration into Indonesia. Whilst not condoning the manner of that integration&mdash;that is a matter of record&mdash;since 1979 Australia has recognised Indonesia's sovereignty over East Timor. The fact that the coalition regards the integration of East Timor into Indonesia as irreversible in no way diminishes its deep concern for the welfare of the East Timorese. So for that reason the coalition will continue to urge the Indonesian government to pursue a policy of long-term reconciliation with the people of East Timor and, to assist in the pursuit of that aim, to support the provision of development assistance by Australia to the province. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the government's response today through the minister to the report on Indonesia by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I simply say that we place extraordinary importance on the relationship with Indonesia. It deserves a better and more detailed response to the committee's report than that which has been presented by the minister today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have no doubt about that. He was better in those days, because he paid attention to the concerns of members of the parliament. I rise to echo the concerns expressed by my colleague the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock). There is a real problem in trying to ensure that the depth of the relationship between Australia and Indonesia is properly taken into account. While I commend the minister for having taken note of some aspects of that report, I do not think it is sufficient that we have only a very bland response to very detailed recommendations on a number of issues of great significance. I do not want to go through them all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague mentioned Surabaya. I suggest that the question of where and when a consulate will be opened in Surabaya is a matter of considerable importance. I will hark back to my Scottish forebears for a moment. The government is just closing down a consulate in Edinburgh. If the government were going to open one in Surabaya because it is closing one in Edinburgh, I might accept it. But a very significant minority in this Australian community regard it as appalling that the government is closing a consulate in Edinburgh and not even opening one in Surabaya. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There is some specific reference to East Timor in the comments and recommendations of the report. It is important that the government recognise that we sought to bridge the gap of misunderstanding which we believe often exists within the government of Indonesia as to the consequences of opening up that province to a greater degree than it now is open. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of our recommendations regarding Dili and the communications with East Timor were essentially designed to reinstate both tourist contact and a regular opportunity for relationships between the Australian media and the Indonesian media by their going into East Timor. I believe that those recommendations would do well to be specifically answered by the Australian government. Doing so would help put pressure on the Indonesian government to do what we all see is necessary, which is to remove some of the cloud of misunderstanding that occurs when people cannot move freely into and out of that province. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Another area which concerns me, in the overall sense, is that if there is to be a proper recognition of the depth of the work of the committee, we really need more than just a general statement. I do not have the report in front of me, but 30 or 40 recommendations were made, and they have not been specifically answered. I put it to the minister that it is necessary that the government not just respond by forming a statement of this order but that in the normal course, under the proceedings that normally take place in this House, a detailed answer to those recommendations be given. In so doing, the government would enhance that relationship on which he and the government place such weight. I can assure him that we on this side of the House also give it great significance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my colleague the honourable member for Kooyong said, few relationships in the Pacific are of more importance than our relationship with Indonesia. Anything that we as parliamentarians and the government can do to enhance that relationship is worth while. From the perspective of the opposition, it is particularly so, for we see that relationship as one that will continue indefinitely into the future. It can only be enhanced if the government is prepared to give a detailed response to those very significant recommendations which form part of that joint committee report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I address the specific topic of this debate, I want to say how much the coalition deplores the failure of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in question time, on the eve of his departure for the D-day commemorations, to give a guarantee that he has abandoned his plans to change the Australian flag. The Australian Labor Party today is a very different Labor Party from the Labor Party that the Australian people came to know over the decades. The old Labor Party was proud of the Australian flag. The old Labor Party was once led by Doc Evatt, who said he thought the Australian flag was the most beautiful flag in the world. The Labor Party is now led by a man who is ashamed of his national flag and our history. He constantly misrepresents it. He is preparing to change the flag which unites Australians across the generations, but we will have none of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The flag is not the only reason why this is not the Labor Party that the Australian people used to know. When Prime Minister Ben Chifley brought down his white paper on employment, he had a plan in that white paper to create jobs. There is no plan or proposal in this white paper or budget which gives the unemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed, of this country any genuine hope that their distress&mdash;caused by the Prime Minister's policies and the policies that are promoted by the minister at the table, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean)&mdash;will be changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new Labor Party is a party whose policies have been dominated by ideology and sectional interest. There has been a massive distortion of the public interest in this country in favour of the sectional groups that back the Labor Party. Every conference held by this party has a majority of trade union officials as its members. Every significant policy that this government brings down, be it related to industrial relations, maternity allowances or training schemes, has to have on it the stamp of the ACTU. It is sectional policy, not policy in the public interest. The fact is that the policies that these sectional interests have approved will entrench the problems that Australia now faces. There is no hope in the white paper or the budget. On behalf of the coalition, I want to bring home to the minister today four very bitter and unpalatable truths. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of these is that, during this government's period in office, the gap between rich and poor in this country has widened. An underclass&mdash;Labor's underclass&mdash;of people trapped in poverty and lacking in hope has been created by the policies of this government. When Labor came to power, the incomes of the top one per cent of the population equalled the incomes of the bottom 11 per cent. By the end of the 1980s, the incomes of the top one per cent of the population equalled the incomes of the bottom 21 per cent. Today, 800,000 people in this country live in families where no-one has a job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister tells us today in this parliament that the achievements of this government are increasingly to be measured by the number of people on welfare. He should get out there and look at what is happening in this country. That underclass is a reality. It comprises the one in five young people living on the margins of society without full-time work, without access to education. It comprises the 450,000 people who have been out of work for over 12 months. It comprises those whom Labor has failed by its inability to face up to the issues in the education system and give basic skills in literacy and numeracy which people need for employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second bit of truth that I want to bring home to the minister is that this underclass has come into existence because Labor deliberately chose a policy of high unemployment. That was all that its accord partners would let it do. It is not the first time that Labor has chosen a policy of high unemployment. The Whitlam government, in three years, doubled the rate of unemployment in this country. It did so for reasons the minister knows well. The sectional allies of this Labor government and previous Labor governments do not care too much about the unemployed because the unemployed do not vote in union elections. Clyde Cameron and Gough Whitlam pushed for wages, the pacesetter Public Service&mdash;and they doubled unemployment. In 1981, the metal unions pushed some 100,000 people out of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes to the crunch, Labor acts ruthlessly to defend the interests of those who support it&mdash;not those of the broad mass of people in this country, not of the people who want jobs, not of the families who want opportunities. In the 1980s, Mr Keating's high interest rates were designed to bring the economy to a screaming halt. He and Labor chose high unemployment because Labor's sectional backers would not let it cut out the excessive regulation in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the third bit of truth that the minister and his government have to face up to. The white paper and the budget will do nothing to solve unemployment. These documents are an attempt to make unemployment palatable to the community. In fact, they confirm that Labor is continuing to pursue a policy of high unemployment. The white paper is a cruel hoax. It is not there to provide jobs for the unemployed; it is there to lower expectations. Let us be quite clear about this: in the white paper and the budget, Labor has abandoned the goal of full employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The green paper made quite clear that growth of 4.75 per cent over the decade is essential to get unemployment down to five per cent. The Treasury, when it was preparing the budget, clearly did not think that was possible with the policies that Labor has got in place. Treasury thought growth would be at best 4.5 per cent across the rest of the decade&mdash;perhaps an average closer to four per cent. That figure means an unemployment rate at the end of the decade of around seven per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This country has run into a terrible problem with unemployment because, with every recession, the base level of unemployment starts off higher and the peak of unemployment gets higher. As Helen Hughes, a very respected economist, told a seminar in Parliament House yesterday, if we start the next recession at the base of seven per cent&mdash;and she said, `Who thinks that there will not be some downturn in the economy over the next few years?'&mdash;the peak will be 15 per cent. That is what the figures in the white paper and the budget mean. The government has entrenched in public policy in this country the high unemployment that is creating Labor's underclass, and it does not propose anything that will deal with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us all be quite clear about this. This is a bitter truth for the minister: he is one of the people most responsible for Australia's high rate of unemployment and the emergence of Labor's underclass. He is the man who has never faced up to the fact that employers will employ when it makes sense to employ and when the cost of employment is not too great. When he was Secretary of the Storemen and Packers Union he went out of his way to squeeze out the junior wage rate, to push wages up towards the adult rates. When he was vice-president of the ACTU he told the Hancock Committee, `It is certainly not our view that the rate of wages paid to youth is the cause of youth unemployment.' It is a pity he did not listen to his father, Frank Crean. Frank Crean knew that one man's wage increase is another man's job. That is what he told the Whitlam government, and it is a pity his son did not listen. No-one has a greater responsibility&mdash;unless it be the Prime Minister himself&mdash;than the minister for the fact that one in five young people in this country today are living on the margins of society. They could not get jobs because he pursued the sectional policies that denied them jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the coalition believe that sensible labour market programs have a role to play. In so far as there is anything of merit in the white paper, it has been taken from the coalition's policies. Even these good ideas&mdash;the training wage for the young unemployed and the longer term unemployed&mdash;have been implemented in a bureaucratic way which shows the obsession that the minister, this very bureaucratic minister, and his allies in the trade union movement have with formal training. They want to strap employers into the Carmichael <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia Reconstructed</EMPHASIS> agenda of formal certified training. Do not think it is only the coalition saying that this is going to be a problem for take-up of the training wage. Professor Julian Disney yesterday made the point that employers are going to stop and think twice before they try to slot themselves into this bureaucratic training system which the government has adopted and which the ACTU&mdash;the sectional allies of the government&mdash;has forced on it in the white paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real solution to the problems of the long-term unemployed lies with training programs which are not distorted by ideology, but particularly, and overwhelmingly, it lies with real jobs. Real jobs are what people want. Families want certainty and security. The thing that gives them that certainty and security is jobs, and that is what the government has not been able to provide. The government's growth rates which are projected in the white paper and the government's current mix of policies are not going to provide those jobs. Instead, we are going to be facing a higher rate of unemployment at the end of this century than that which we faced at the start of the last recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the fine print in the white paper, we find that there are a lot of things wrong with the specific measures in that paper. For example, there is an admission that it is going to be another four years before the people who are currently long-term unemployed can be guaranteed placements. The long-term unemployed are going to have to wait four years before they get any sort of guarantee of placement under the job compact, even on the government's own terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will remember what happened to One Nation. It became a laughing stock because the investment it projected was never made. People kept waiting and waiting to see One Nation work and it did not work. People are going to be waiting and waiting and waiting to see the recently announced schemes come into existence, and those schemes are not going to work, either, because they are going to have to be implemented by a bureaucracy and a department which has an exceptionally bad record and which is, at the moment, in a state of massive internal reorganisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister knows&mdash;he smiles at that&mdash;that there are problems. This department will have to establish 60 regional committees over the next few months. How long is it going to take them to establish these committees when it is in the process of abolishing the state offices that could help coordinate the establishment of these committees?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday Professor Julian Disney made a point about case management. He is very sceptical, as are people in community organisations, about this case management that the minister speaks so much about. This will not come into existence within the next year in any way that will have any impact on the problems of the long-term unemployed. There is very little emphasis on getting people ready for jobs and there is absolutely nothing in the white paper about helping these long-term unemployed when they come out of the six-month placement. Are these people going to get jobs? They will not get jobs unless the economy grows and it is not going to grow at the rate necessary to give them jobs. </PARA>

His previous roles in this parliament were as shadow minister for education, from which he was dumped, and shadow minister for science and technology, in which he failed to make an impact despite the fact that there were concerns in the science community about what the government was doing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a ludicrous statement that his party would never choose or support a policy of unemployment! What did those opposite leave Labor with in 1983? They left us with an unemployment rate close to 12 per cent, a lower participation rate than today, and double digit inflation. That is a great double. Those opposite could not manage to achieve low inflation in the economy even when there was high unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister says that the government has no plan. Let me take the opportunity to outline the plan that Labor has announced in the white paper for getting jobs for Australians. Labor recognises in the white paper series of initiatives that the key component for securing jobs is economic growth. The national account figures released yesterday confirm not only what we have been saying about the budget forecasts but also that circumstances of sustained high levels of economic growth will translate into jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister asked what we have done to create jobs and what is contained in this paper to do it. Let me remind him that in the last 12 months Labor has been responsible for creating 236,000 jobs. We went to the election promising 500,000 new jobs. We have delivered almost half that amount in a third of the time. Let me also remind the honourable member that, on assuming office in 1983 after those horrendous levels of unemployment foisted on us by the previous conservative governments, in the period 1983-89 we created 1.6 million jobs in this economy&mdash;the fastest employment growth rate of any Western nation&mdash;and unemployment came down to five per cent. </PARA>

We did it; Japan and Western Germany followed. Those opposite have to understand that the plan of One Nation did work and that it is part of the reason we have the growth levels we have today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is contained in the white paper to help sustain these high levels of economic growth that we are currently experiencing? There are industry policy initiatives aimed at encouraging best practices as well as tax incentives for investment in patient capital. These are very important initiatives. I refer the shadow minister to them because he seems to make no mention of them. The regional development initiatives aim at assisting regions identify and realise their strengths and participation in and contribution to the economic recovery. The benefits from the acceleration of enterprise bargaining are clearly beginning to show up, and this is evidenced by the labour productivity improvements released in the national account figures yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Normally labour productivity does pick up with an economic recovery, so one would expect it to happen now. We have had trend improvements in labour productivity since 1990&mdash;in other words, in the last three years. The benefits of freeing up the wages system and the movement to enterprise bargaining, which has been supported by the trade union movement in this country, have paid important dividends to date and they can only be built upon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important dimension in the white paper from my portfolio perspective is the deliberate strategy to promote the importance of skill formation to improve our productivity and help underpin sustained high levels of economic growth. This is a major micro-economic reform. The shadow minister fails to recognise that. Every writer who talks about what an economy needs to do to build its capacity to grow points to the fundamental importance of skill formation. Within this white paper we have a deliberate policy to propel that agenda through different mechanisms from the traditional ones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But at the same time as developing these sensible micro-economic policies we have said one important thing that distinguishes us from the opposition. It is true that the experience of recessions both here and elsewhere in the world shows that economic growth alone will not look after the long-term unemployed. They need special attention, and we have committed additional resources for those people unfortunately placed in that group to ensure that they have the opportunity to compete for the growth in job opportunities which will come off the economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is sensible, cohesive strategy. The plan is about sustaining economic growth at high levels. It is about ensuring skill formation and a deliberate strategy to achieve that so that we can encourage economic growth and, importantly, ensure that we do not constrain our ability as a nation to grow by running into skill blockages. It is also about ensuring that, in the process, we do not leave the long-term unemployed behind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister says that we have no plan. Let me take him through the details of how we will implement our strategy. The training wage was not borrowed from the coalition's document, because its training wage had no real commitment to training. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Dr Kemp" NAMEID="BT4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr Kemp</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That's not true.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition had a commitment in the second version of Fightback to a voucher system of training for young people and long-term unemployed over the age of 45. What about the group in the middle? All it was offering them was cuts in their wages and an even bigger cut in their wages if they had been out of the work force for a long time. Its strategy was to simply reduce wages and make no real commitment to training.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have negotiated with the trade union movement and the employer groups of this country a training wage that for the first time is being introduced for adults. It develops a more cohesive and simple structure for youth, but based on competency&mdash;not age. The training that attracts the wage has very much an enterprise focus. The training can be done on the job. Business can identify its training needs and get approval for them. That is another important reason why the enterprise approach has been adopted. There is a devolution of responsibility. Firms have the ability to say what they want and the required skill formation can be matched with an individual. Those skills can then be transported. It is that win-win outcome that will be good not only for employers of this country but for individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The training wage has nothing to do with cutting wages. It is about genuinely linking the wages structure to the recognition that a strategy is needed to develop training in this country. But the training wage stands independent of whether or not a person is unemployed. The training wage stands in its own right. Your cut in wages would have stigmatised the long-term unemployed. The only people that employers could employ on a lower rate would have been unemployed people. Our training wage is available to anyone. It is available to any employer who is prepared to commit to the training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the employer can also access a much better wage subsidy regime. The wages subsidy arrangements now run for nine months&mdash;not six months, as they did previously. There is a lump sum bonus available to employers who are prepared to keep employees on for at least three months after the subsidy runs out. Importantly, consistent with the policy, a higher subsidy is available to employers who are prepared to commit to training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have significantly resourced the development of traineeships under this package. We have a commitment to find an extra 50,000 places. This is not because we want to pretend that people who are being trained are not counted as being unemployed. It is because we recognise that, if unemployed people are to be given mainstream employment opportunities, they have to be given the opportunity to develop skills which their separation from the work force has denied them to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So employers have three options which they can combine: training wage, wage subsidy or traineeships. All of them are backed substantially by resources that this government is prepared to fund in a fiscally responsible way. It is little wonder that this announcement has been hailed around the country. Through the arbitration commission, employers have endorsed and supported the concept of the training wage. This indicates that there is real confidence back in this economy because of policies that we have pursued in the past and that we are continuing to build on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another dimension of this strategy is important. You quote Mr Julian Disney, and I do not know whether he has ever employed anyone in his life. We have talked to employers about their concerns and how they can be met through these proposals. We set up Nettforce to build on the success of the Fox-Kelty relationship. They went around to businesses, talked their language and got them to pick up the programs. But we have equipped the body with a much better set of programs and opportunities to sell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I attended the first meeting of Nettforce last Monday week. It has already made important decisions to rationalise and simplify the traineeship system and to develop new traineeships in areas in which there is growing demand for employment with certain levels of skills. These areas include the environment, aged care, rural and land development, and sports. We have had discussions with the AFL. We are saying to groups in the community which know that there are opportunities to employ people, regardless of whether they are young people, long-term unemployed or older people in the community, `Come forward and identify your proposal and see how you can access the resources.' It is through that means that we will continue to build on the significant employment strength that we have had to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If employers, employees or the unemployed are concerned that the CES is not up to the task, we have opened up the delivery of these opportunities to private case management. The case management is a fundamental development in this country. We are ahead of the rest of the world in recognising its importance. It is a means by which the client is not just the unemployed; the client is also the employer. We are seeking to get a much better matching of the skills required by the employer and those which need to be developed by the individual. The government made an historic statement the other day. It builds on the success of other programs and we will get people back to work in this country as a result. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government's failure to deal with the underlying factors impacting on unemployment comes through clearly not only in its approach to the job compact but also in its inability to address the real needs of regional development. I will deal firstly with unemployment. What is abundantly obvious is the role that sections of the union movement have played in resisting that change. As Des Moore very succinctly put it in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> earlier in May and as my friend the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) put it, the bitter and unpalatable truth that comes through is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The union movement is now the bulwark of Australian conservatism. It is fiercely resistant to the variety of changes needed to reduce unemployment. In particular, its relationship with the government through the accord has preserved an industrial relations framework that still protects those who have jobs from competition from those who do not.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that says it all very clearly. There is no denying that the government's proposed labour market programs will generate some jobs. I do not knock the concept of training. The question is rather their sustainability and how the government will tackle the problems of the long-term unemployed. At the end of the day, there will have to be real jobs to go to, and that will not happen until genuine reforms take place. There is evidence, as my colleague the honourable member for Goldstein outlined, that the government at its moment of truth is seen to be accepting some of the reforms but mainly nibbling at the edges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is caught in a union-contrived vice. On the one side, it must look to its power base where many of its members have had their nurturing and, as such, must support the award system. On the other side, it must pander to the naked pressure exerted as a pay-off for past favours. This could not be illustrated any more forcefully than by the Industrial Relations Reform Act, which the minister was humiliatingly forced to climb down from. That now infamous and petulant statement by Stan Sharkey shows just how tight that vice can get. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great out for the government is to paint itself as being compassionate and caring and to wrap up and disguise the true level of unemployment not only by its various short-term and medium-term employment programs but also by the removal of the young and the old from the employment statistics by redefining them euphemistically as youth training initiatives and mature age allowances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As was said yesterday by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), the ALP has gone very quiet on its Swedish model&mdash;and that is not the long-haired type. Though Sweden was able to disguise its unemployment, which was quoted in 1990 as two per cent, it could not do so more recently, even with labour market programs, and had to admit to an eight per cent unemployment level. Commentators around the world say that the real level is somewhere near 13 per cent. Are we not going down that same track? No wonder the ACTU does not talk about <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia Reconstructed</EMPHASIS> and its now discredited Swedish modelling. This is summed up beautifully by Des Moore in his article when he states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we should not be seduced into thinking that a caring society is one which should avoid further economic reforms and which can instead look after the unemployed with government-funded labour market programs.</PARA>
<PARA>As we move into regional Australia, the problems are exacerbated. Not only do award inflexibilities bite harder, but also at many levels the need for infrastructure is more profound. Award flexibility was highlighted in the Industry Commission's report into regional industry adjustment. There are a number of wide ranging quotations from government, councils and regional development organisations which say it all. The National Farmers Federation states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the centralised wage fixing system is a highly prominent impediment to regional industry adjustment.</PARA>
<PARA>A Sunshine Coast report states that there needs to be facilitation for:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the further deregulation of the national labour market by accepting and encouraging the development of regional labour wage rates.</PARA>
<PARA>The Maryborough Development Committee states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is scope, because of the generally lower cost of living . . . in comparison to capital city area locations for these cost disadvantages to be offset by a reduced cost of labour.</PARA>
<PARA>The New South Wales government states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the traditional approach to industrial relations has probably contributed to the lack of voluntary decentralisation by firms.</PARA>
<PARA>We then have the daddy of them all&mdash;the Goss Labor government states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been little focus on incorporating conditions specific to a peculiar region.</PARA>
<PARA>If the Goss Labor government agrees with me, I must be on good ground. The commission's view was that deregulation of wages was unlikely to bring about widespread wage reductions and that, over time, it could be expected to lead to a divergence in wages across regions. In turn, the American experience has been that, where this divergence occurs between regions, there is competition for local work force locations. Initially, firms are attracted to regions with competitive wage structures. However, once there and stimulating the local economy, the general level of wages commences to rise. There has been a similar experience of growth in the UK Midlands area, where through lower cost inputs&mdash;largely, land and wages&mdash;great economic progress has been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I expect, however, that this will be too much for the government to digest. The Kelty task force came up with a wish list of warm fuzzy concepts largely to offset the hard-nosed approach to the Industry Commission, which would be anathema to Mr Kelty's union colleagues. I interpose here to say that the regional analyses of the task force's Developing Australia documents are notable for their banality. We really could have obtained the basic data on most regions from a one-hour visit to the local development bureau. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that comes across is a lack of understanding of regionalism. A region is not necessarily a statistical region over which the government imposes another level of bureaucracy. That is what is recommended in the white paper. I will continue to reiterate the point that regions need not be so large that they are irrelevant nor so small that they are parochial. They need to be relevant to the resources and primary productions inherent to a particular area, and they need to have a well defined transport and communications system and shires and local authorities that can work together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have two such industry regions in my own electorate of Hinkler: one in Bundaberg in the northern Wide Bay-Burnett statistical region, and the other at Gladstone in the southern Capricornia statistical region. As at March, these statistical regions had unemployment of 14 per cent and 12 per cent respectively. But what is even more important and even more frightening is that youth unemployment is 42 per cent in the Bundaberg region and 47 per cent in the Gladstone region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Kelty task force, of course, came up with a number of recommendations: regional economic development organisations&mdash;it did not know they existed, perhaps; regional pooled development funds&mdash;they have been around for a while; and yet another fuel tax. While acknowledging the deleterious effects of a raft of taxes, it ducked the real issue of removing those compounding taxes. It also recommended the privatisation of airports. Much that is in the budget and Working Nation has come to pass, including the proposed privatisation of airports and the removal of the training levy. But, in concertinaing these three statements, which the government was going to make into Working Nation, it showed just how thin on the ground its regional development concepts were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was disappointed at the way the government picked winners in the Goulburn Valley, Sunraysia and Badgerys Creek, without in any way disparaging the efforts of those regions. While I applaud the $70 million for the regional strategy infrastructure program, it has a very nice proviso added to it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commitment from sectors other than the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA>So presumably, if the states do not play ball, it does not happen. While $81 million for a regional economic development, structure, strategy and project program looks very healthy, when we look at it over four years we see that it does not come across quite so well. If we divide it by four years, then divide it by six states and two territories and then divide it by an average of 10 regions per state, we find that the average amount that will be available to the average region in Australia will be about $350,000. With three subprograms we could hardly say that this was going to have any great impact on problems of regional organisations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The subject of the matter of public importance, in short, under the hand of the shadow minister for employment, training and family services, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), is the failure of the government in the white paper to address the need of the long-term unemployed for real jobs. In very many respects, this echoes a matter of public importance which was put before us on 3 May by the former Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge). I think the fact that in a sense we have a mirror debate means one thing: that nothing much has changed on the other side. Despite the leadership changes, we still have yesterday's men replacing yesterday's men, and the only real change has been the hard Right replacing the soft Right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regarding the matter of public importance, I am very surprised that many honourable members opposite do not appear to have even read the white paper. So I will make it easy for them; I will refer to pages 1 and 2 of the white paper. Page 1 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Economic growth is the best way of generating new and worthwhile jobs to meet the needs of an expanding workforce and to make inroads into unemployment. Jobs created by economic growth need no subsidies and contribute to a higher standard of living for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Economic growth and employment growth thus go together. Sustained growth requires the continuation of low inflation, and the maintenance of our improved competitiveness through higher investment (funded increasingly from domestic savings) and improved productivity. The more robust economic growth which results will maximise the generation of employment.</PARA>
<PARA>On page 2 the paper goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While economic growth is the key, waiting for growth alone will not suffice. To bring unemployment down more rapidly, the Government will intervene directly to assist long term unemployed people, and those at risk of becoming long term unemployed. This, in turn, will increase the rate of economic growth that can be sustained.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the philosophy behind the white paper and the measures adopted by the government. It is basically a philosophical approach of growth-plus. We believe in maximising economic growth but also taking special steps to ensure that the long-term unemployed are picked up. Why is that the case? Because we know and have been led to the view from a modicum of study, in this area and in relevant overseas countries, that growth by itself is not sufficient to pick up long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty for honourable members opposite is that they do not like growth. With the five per cent growth figure out yesterday, we saw the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), doing their best to duck and weave but, basically, to disassociate themselves from growth. Also, they do not like the plus; they will not take special measures. All their special measures are not pluses; they are minuses. I will refer to them in some detail shortly. But, basically, their special measures are slashing wages and tipping people off unemployment benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the conditions which will see us have a sustained period of economic growth? The Treasurer (Mr Willis) in question time referred to many of them: low inflation; low inflationary expectations; low interest rates; high business confidence, particularly in the manufacturing area; consumer confidence; increased productivity; labour costs declining in real terms over the last decade; record profit share; international competitiveness improving by 30 per cent; lowest industrial disputation for 30 years; and massive increases in our export performance, particularly in the area of manufactures and services. I draw the attention of honourable members opposite to the Treasurer's budget speech, in which he refers to that performance. I quote the relevant extract:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . our export performance in recent years has been nothing less than outstanding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The volume of manufacturing exports grew by 15 per cent in 1993, and has grown by an average of 13 per cent a year since the mid-80s.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly exports of services grew by 11 per cent last year and have increased by 9 per cent per annum since the mid-80s.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a consequence of these developments, commodities now represent around 65 per cent of our total volume of exports, compared to almost 80 per cent a decade ago.</PARA>
<PARA>So these measures resulted in what we saw yesterday&mdash;five per cent economic growth. In addition, honourable members opposite talk about investment. Let us look at the range of incentives in the financial year 1994-95 for investment by the business community. There is about $3 billion worth of incentives, which range through accelerated depreciation measures, the development allowance, the general investment allowance, the 150 per cent research and development concession, the reduction of the corporate rate of taxation from 39 per cent to 33 per cent&mdash;at precisely the time that those opposite were suggesting that it should be increased from 39 per cent to 45 per cent, plus a 15 per cent GST&mdash;and measures in the white paper in respect of the pooled development funds and infrastructure bonds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will refer to some of the special measures which we saw in the white paper. I have covered our efforts to maximise growth, and we saw the results yesterday and we will see the results in the future. The special measures basically revolve around the job compact. The purpose of the job compact is to break the cycle of long-term unemployment through training and work experience programs. The compact will provide to every person who has been unemployed over 18 months duration a guaranteed place through the provision of the training wage, private sector job subsidies, new self-employment opportunities, public sector work experience and training schemes, new work opportunities in the community sector and, finally, all unemployed young people will have help in obtaining training and job placement immediately after leaving school. The Special Minister of State (Mr Johns), who is at the dispatch box, covered case management and some of the voluntary work provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to those special measures, let me just repeat some of the measures in respect of growth and incentives for business. In the white paper we find increased access to capital for business, particularly small business, the suspension of the training guarantee levy, a training wage for juniors and adults, import replacement through an effective government purchasing policy and increased access to research and development tax concessions so that small business can develop good ideas. The shadow minister said that he understood private enterprise. How were all these measures received? A media release by the Business Council of Australia states:</PARA>

In recent times we have seen the new Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition saying, `We are not ideological. We believe in practical, commonsense solutions. We are really policy sheep.' Let us just see what they stand for. I was very interested to see a description of the new Deputy Leader of the Opposition in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> of 9 April 1994.

<PARA>He was referring there to the creation of jobs. What does he mean by tough decisions? We have not seen a great articulation of that other than that which we know those opposite were committed to at the last election. I was very interested to see an article written by the shadow minister published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 18 March 1993. He commented on the opposition's defeat at that election and the reasons why it occurred. He had this to say about the Fightback package:</PARA>

It is true that we have put in place a second chamber for the consideration of non-controversial matters, committee reports and other things, including departmental reports which, it has been moved, are to be noted by the parliament. These bills are unlikely to be in that sort of category. That is the first point I would make about them. Secondly, irrespective of the fact that that will ultimately substantially contribute to the proper deliberation upon and effective conduct of legislation through the House, we are always going to be confronted with a situation, particularly related to budget matters, whereby we have to get the matters into the Senate within a reasonable period of time for the Senate to consider them. </PARA>

Week 1, 6 to 9 June inclusive, was also to be set aside for the discussion of appropriation bills, including consideration in detail.

On top of that, we were to consider the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Duty) Act Repeal Bill, the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products Levy Imposition (Collection of Levy) (No. 2) Bill, the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products Levy Imposition (Excise) (No. 2) Bill, the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products Levy Imposition (Customs) (No. 2) Bill, and the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products Levy Imposition (General) (No. 2) Bill. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning we heard from the Chief Government Whip, the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay). `Chief Government Whip' is a quaint English title that has been adopted by the Labor government. The government spends much time slamming the British for a range of things but it has adopted some of the titles that are applicable in the House of Commons. I add that the Main Committee, the second chamber, is in fact a derivation of the same type of committee that meets in the House of Commons. Those opposite give a serve to the British on the one hand while on the other hand they adopt some of the practices of the British House of Commons. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly the emoluments were of some interest, but the point of the matter is that, in the first instance, those of us on the procedure committee who were interested in making this place more representative and more democratic wanted to see at least the opportunity for members to have more time to debate the bills that their constituents want them to voice their concerns about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, as you know from the quite lengthy debates we have had in the past on the subject of that procedure committee report and then, of course, the motion to amend the standing and sessional orders as a result of that and the government's response, a number of us still have very serious concerns about the real intent of the government in relation to the changes to the House of Representatives procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my view that, in actual fact, this is merely an attempt by the government, using the Main Committee when it wants to, to clear the decks of what it calls non-contentious legislation. Many people out in the community would not consider any legislation to be non-contentious. Legislation affects everybody's day-to-day lives. But the point is to clear the decks of this legislation to provide the platform for the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to come in two days a week and make his announcements based on the huge number of working parties and task forces that are at present roving around the country trying to find places to spend taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Effectively, it is basically perverting the processes of the House of Representatives in order to give the government an opportunity to give itself the chance to win the next federal election. That is a matter of serious concern to me. I think the evidence of that intent is quite clear this evening as we debate this motion to guillotine legislation through the House next week and starting at 5.30 when the time for the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) will expire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intent has been demonstrated purely and simply. We can see that when the so-called reasons for the reform of the processes of the House of Representatives were being touted at the time of the procedure committee report, in actual fact there was no such intent to give members of the House a greater opportunity to participate in debates. In fact it is a hollow sham and the government knows it. All we are seeing tonight is the most visible sign of that sham. Over the next 18 months we will see progressively the government showing quite clearly what its intent was in the first instance; that is, to clear the decks in the House to give the Prime Minister the opportunity to ram through legislation as a result of the findings of these task forces on how to spend taxpayers' money to win votes in the lead-up to the next general election. </PARA>

I, as an elected representative of the people of Isaacs, believe that I have a right to speak on their behalf on issues, particularly budgetary issues, that affect this country and affect them.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comment of `good', made by the Chief Government Whip when I said that I was not going to speak for long, is the type of thing that really concerns me about the way this government is handling the process of democracy and free speech in this country. Every time a piece of legislation comes through on which I believe I can represent the people of my electorate, we seem to go through this process of the guillotine. It is always blamed on the other place. It is blamed on somebody else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have given tacit support, I guess, to the government to allow it to sort out the ways of solving this problem. We have continually said that we are prepared to come back and sit here on a more regular basis if necessary for people to be given the democratic right to speak on the issues that they believe need to be spoken on. In this place we continually see legislation going through, along with amendments to legislation to rectify problems with legislation that has already gone through this place. Why do we get it? We get it because there is not the opportunity for debate in this place or the opportunity for us to rectify many of the faults that there are in government legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think a little more interest needs to be taken by the government in the democratic process that was established in 1901 and it needs to look back to the way this place was intended to operate instead of worrying about all the changes it wants to make.

We will have standing committee chairmen, indeed. I find it a little strange that chairmen of parliamentary committees, appointed by this parliament and answerable to this chamber, suddenly get transformed into pseudo-ministers or parliamentary secretaries.

They do not even read their second reading speeches any more. They do not listen to the debate so far as we are aware.

I think it is utterly unsatisfactory for parliamentary secretaries to handle legislation when the relevant ministers are members of the House.

My National Party colleagues will have to bear with me here. Whenever there was a crisis or a scandal in Queensland, he used to act as though it did not exist.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are important issues relating to government activity and behaviour, not least its legislation and now its budget, that need to be debated in this place. As I said a few minutes ago, we were told by the government that the purpose of this Main Committee was to extend our ability to debate legislation. When we objected, the government told us this was to overcome the need for a guillotine. What do we have here? A guillotine. About 20 to 30 speakers are yet to speak on the budget, the most important single matter put in front of the parliament each year, and we do not have the opportunity to speak on behalf of our constituencies because of the guillotine. </PARA>

Honourable members will have an unlimited number of times of five minutes within each 30-minute slot next week, but they can claim a second right to speak only if nobody else is seeking the call, so it will not happen that they will get more than five minutes each. I do not resile at all from revealing that there was very heavy pressure in that committee to try to cut back the general debating time on other items.

It is just a standard complaint. When the legislative program comes out, all these bills get listed as important and urgent. We will wait to see whether there is any guillotine put on them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, on 7 June in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>, the well-known and respected author and commentator, Laurie Oakes, made some remarks relating to activities within this House. Under a headline `Keating shoots the messenger', the journalist made the following remarks in part:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In private, Keating refers to Savva&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Nicky Savva, a journalist in the press gallery&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">as "the Tory bitch". The female political correspondent of another major newspaper is "the fat-arsed bitch". It would be interesting to know if Anne Summers, the prominent feminist Keating employed before the last election to help win the women's vote, regards "bitch" as an ideologically sound term. But then, just about every political journalist who has dared to criticise Keating&mdash;male or female&mdash;has been lumped with a nasty nickname. We all know he is a charmer.</PARA>
<PARA>Use of those words, the advice to journalists of those words, in my view, consists of sexual harassment. As you are aware, Mr Speaker, I have put questions to you today as to the responsibilities of the parliament, and possibly and consequently with you as the titular head, as an employer of persons such as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in dealing with matters of this nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is that recently in Western Australia, as I drew to your attention today, two cases have been judged against employers and, in one case, a union relating to sexual harassment. On the first occasion the harassment was the failure of the employer to prevent the publication of pornographic photographs in the workplace of two women. I note that one member&mdash;I think it is the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson)&mdash;is laughing about that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I waited and listened to the honourable gentleman. The essence of what he is saying is basically an attack upon a member of this House. Under the standing orders, if he wants to do that, the appropriate process is not to use the adjournment debate; it is to move a substantive motion. I suggest that to use this process is out of order.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened intently to the point of order that has been raised. But in listening to the honourable member for O'Connor, whilst he is roaming reasonably widely, he has not substantiated any particular point which would go to the issue raised by the honourable member.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SJ4">Mr TUCKEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am making the point that it is the responsibility of an employer, and I am expanding on the question that I put to you today, Mr Speaker, about the responsibility of this parliament. Judgments have been made that employers are responsible for the activities of their employees if those employees display pornographic material which is offensive to other employees. A judgment has been made that a union, because it did not assist the women concerned, was also liable and was called upon to pay damages of the order of $90,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another case was settled against an employer, who happened to be a licensed publican, on the basis that he failed to prevent&mdash;I stress the word `prevent'&mdash;his own patrons from sexually harassing two women who were entertaining on his premises. One might wonder how one would do that, but that was the judgment of the court. I am now putting to you, Mr Speaker, that evidence has been published and has been raised in this parliament, and this parliament has to decide whether it collectively or through you or maybe through the Governor-General has a similar responsibility to those two employers and that union that I just spoke about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first question, which is not to be decided by us necessarily, is whether sexual harassment has occurred? I argue it has, but that issue is not the real question. The real question is: have we done sufficient to prevent prosecution of the parliament because we failed to prevent sexual harassment? Secondly, if sexual harassment has occurred, what steps are we taking to investigate that sexual harassment? What is this parliament doing under the laws we have written and on which judgments have been made?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can report to the House the outstanding economic statistics coming out of Sydney's south-west as part of the national recovery. Members opposite should listen to the good news coming out of the industrial heartland of this nation. In Sydney's south-west, taking in the local government areas of Wollondilly, Camden, Campbelltown, Liverpool, Fairfield and including all of my electorate, the DEET figures for December 1992 showed that unemployment was 16.6 per cent. The December 1993 figures released in the last fortnight show that that figure has fallen to 13.3 per cent. So in the industrial heartland there is a three percentage point fall in unemployment, which is quite substantial and indicates how this very important south-west part of Sydney is grabbing a huge share of the national recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is happening because of innovation and change in the workplace. Listening to Professor Helen Hughes at a library seminar yesterday I was reminded of how out of date the opposition and some commentators have become. Professor Hughes raised the argument that we should in Australia be getting more plant utilisation&mdash;that is, instead of working one and two shifts in manufacturing enterprise, there should be three. I quizzed her on the figures and she indicated that the figures are outdated, there is no reliable ABS data, but the best estimate is that 11 per cent of manufacturing companies run three shifts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She should come to the industrial heartland of Sydney's south-west and visit the factories I have seen in recent months, such as ABB, Alcatel, MM Cables, Kimberly-Clark, Pax Australia and the medium sized plastics enterprises in the Minto and Campbelltown industrial estates. Then she would learn, as members opposite would learn, that Australian industry is innovating and displaying enterprise at a far faster rate than they appreciate. They already have enterprise agreements that involve three-shift work arrangements and the full utilisation of plant 24 hours a day. They are doing all the things the government points out in this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This shows it is happening on the shopfloor, in the workplace. The opposition should appreciate that. Enterprise agreements are taking hold, and the unions are playing a constructive role. They know that to compete in manufacturing in Australia you need to be innovative and you need full plant utilisation. If Professor Hughes and members opposite update their figures and actually visit enterprises, they will find out that those things are happening. They are happening in the manufacturing heartland of my electorate, in Sydney's south-west. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation gives the lie to the way in which members opposite in the debate on the appropriation bills this week have been raising the model of Asia. Someone has passed around the Liberal-National party room an article about Asian economies which says we have to do everything Asian&mdash;take up Asian work practices, Asian culture, Asian this and Asian that. They should appreciate that, while the Asian nations are our competitors, they are not our model. The government is developing an Australian model. It is reflected in the sort of innovation and enterprise seen in the industrial heartland of my electorate, which I cited earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not need to be obsessed with copying what other countries do to out compete them. Sure they are our competitors. They, in terms of economic performance, are a source of comparison, but they are not the model that we need to use in this nation to be successful. The Australian model of social tolerance and a social safety net is very important. If you have social unrest and are not looking after the disadvantaged you will have social agitation and resistance to economic reform that holds back the process in a democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Asian model is not the one that Australia should be following. The Asian countries are our competitors. We have our own model which is about social compassion and tolerance, and enterprise and innovation in the workplace. As long as this government keeps promoting that, and we get these very good employment figures out of industry innovation in a region like Sydney's south-west, the government is right on track for making this a sustained recovery right through the 1990s, bringing unemployment down in regional Australia. This is evident in the rates we have seen in the DEET figures for 1993, and it will accelerate even further for 1994. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) There is a difference in the number of study units required to be undertaken by an Open Learning student for the purposes of receiving Austudy and the number for accessing the Open Learning Deferred Payment Scheme (OLDPS).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This difference exists because of the way a full-time workload is measured under the two programs:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austudy is designed primarily to assist full-time students. The Austudy Regulations measure a student's workload at each time during the year. Generally, a student is full-time if at least 75% of the normal full-time workload of the student's course is undertaken. To receive assistance for an Open Learning study period (there are four such periods in a year), students generally need to undertake at least 3 Open Learning units. This requirement is consistent with the workload required at any time by students undertaking university study with which Open Learning study is appropriately compared.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OLDPS is a significant equity measure, allowing eligible Open Learning students to defer the payment of the basic charge of their units in the same way as university students can defer payment of their liabilities under the Higher Education Contribution Scheme. The scheme is available to students undertaking at least 75% of a full-time study load. To be eligible, students must enrol in a `semester', that is two consecutive study periods. Students must undertake at least three units in the `semester' and at least two of these units must be undertaken in the first study period. Students may defer payment for a maximum of 8 units in a 12 month period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) It is not proposed to change the way in which a full-time workload is measured under Austudy. If the Austudy workload rule was to be relaxed to reflect the rule under the OLDPS, assistance would be provided to students undertaking only one or two units during a particular study period. Such a student would receive assistance while studying a lesser workload than that required of a university student. A university student undertaking the same workload would be studying part-time. It would not be equitable to provide Austudy to the Open Learning student, but not to the university student.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difference in the assessment of what constitutes a `full-time' student under the Austudy and the OLDP schemes became an issue as a result of the situation described in the answer to (3).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have agreed to relax the Austudy rules so that Open Learning students can receive assistance for the full year of study. Previously, Austudy was provided for a full year only where a student undertook at least three units in each of the first and the second study periods. For 1994, students who study at least three units in each of the first and the third study periods will be able to receive Austudy for the full year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the first year of operation of the OLDPS and the Government intends to evaluate the scheme later in the year to assess its impact on the target group. The scheme's eligibility rules will be reviewed as part of this evaluation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) This has been the position, but with the change in the Austudy requirement, Open Learning students will now be able to access the OLDPS for the number of units needed to be undertaken to receive Austudy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the previous Austudy arrangement, an Open Learning student needed to undertake a total of six units in the first and second study periods. Owing to an anomaly in the legislation for the OLDPS, the number of units for which a student can defer payment in the first `semester' was limited to four. Students, therefore, needed to pay Open Learning registration charges up front for two units. Amendments to the OLDPS legislation will be introduced in the Winter sittings to remove the limitation of a maximum of four units in the student's first semester. In the meantime, an administrative arrangement has been put in place which overcomes the unintended limit and enables students to meet the requirements of both Austudy and OLDPS. The overall annual limit for deferred payment (8 units) will remain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the effect of the Austudy rule change and the removal of the OLDPS four-unit limitation, students will have greater flexibility with respect to their study load patterns.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Austudy became available to Open Learning students from the beginning of 1993. A total of 164 students received Austudy assistance in 1993. For 1994, 328 students were receiving assistance as at 12 May 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) In 1993, 124 students received assistance for at least the first study period, with most of these qualifying for assistance for the whole year. 12 students received assistance for the third study period only. It is not possible to isolate the number of students who received AUSTUDY for study only in the first and third study periods. It is likely, however, that no students were in this position.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4)(a) The Commonwealth has allocated up to $28.412m to the Open Learning Agency of Australia (OLAA) from 1 January 1993 to 31 December 1995 to support the establishment of the Agency and the provision of Open Learning study units. After 1995, the OLAA is expected to be self-funding. Commonwealth funding is not allocated on the basis of student load.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4)(b) Conventional institutions are funded on the basis of an equivalent full-time student (EFTSU) total load target and receive a single block operating grant to cover their teaching and research activities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1994, higher education institutions will receive $4.029 billion in operating grants (excluding capital roll-in) from the Commonwealth. On the basis of a total EFTSU of 403,290, the system wide average funding rate is approximately $10,000. Amounts allocated by institutions to particular disciplines and levels of award will vary from this figure depending on the costs of provision and institutional priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) This information is not available.
