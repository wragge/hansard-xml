<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, I present the committee's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working with the environment: opportunities for job growth</EMPHASIS>, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KG4">Mr LANGMORE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report I have just tabled arises from an inquiry which began in May last year when unemployment was at peak levels. The committee saw a real opportunity through this inquiry to identify specific proposals which would create productive sustainable jobs and at the same time protect our environment. Job creation and environmental protection are both urgent national priorities. Although the number of persons in employment has significantly increased since the inquiry commenced, unemployment, with its terrible human, economic and social costs, remains tragically high.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee found that in almost all situations there is a need for environmental and economic policies to be better coordinated and integrated. The rhetoric of ecologically sustainable development is gaining acceptance, but policy development and program delivery are still carried out in comparative isolation in the separate parts of the Commonwealth administration that are variously concerned with environment protection, industry development, economic growth and employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has endeavoured to identify ways of achieving more effective integration of environmental and economic policies. To this end, many of the recommendations in this report propose new mechanisms and consultative arrangements to bring together the various elements of the administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This need to integrate environmental and economic policies reflects the broader need for a paradigm shift in society's attitude towards employment and the environment. A conflict between caring for the environment and jobs is not inevitable. Environmental responsibility and sustainable productive employment can be combined. Essentially, protecting the environment creates jobs. Most sectors of industry have already recognised that protecting the environment through cleaner production is not only good for their corporate image but good business and can generate increased profits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Responsible environmental policy is likely to lead to a net growth of employment because, first, additional care for the environment is likely to ensure a substantial expansion of work; second, environmentally sound technology is commonly more labour intensive than older technologies; third, the environment industry offers considerable opportunities to increase exports; and, fourth, environmentally sound policy enables productive processes to be sustainable in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although cleaner production in industry can lower costs, its job creation or potential for maintaining jobs is not always immediately quantifiable. Overseas experience has demonstrated, however, that investment in cleaner production by industry can not only cut production costs but also provide a substantial stimulus to the pollution control and waste management industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without doubt, there are considerable opportunities for the development of a substantial environment industry in Australia. Worldwide, the environment industry is already larger than the aerospace industry. Along with information technology, environment management is set to be one of the growth industries of the nineties, and this is likely to continue into the next century. There are particular opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region, as the growing newly industrialised nations remedy the severe environmental problems which have resulted from their recent rapid economic growth and urbanisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Growth of the environment industry will create jobs. On the basis of conservative OECD estimates of industry growth, the Australian pollution control industry alone could generate 20,000 jobs by the year 2000. On a more expansive note, if Australia could capture only two per cent of the world market by 2000, the $8 billion of business activity could generate some 150,000 jobs. The opportunities are there. The challenge for government, industry and the community is how to best develop them. Essentially, rhetoric must be replaced by action to overcome Commonwealth and state demarcation problems and bureaucratic inertia. There is a clear need for the Commonwealth government to demonstrate leadership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the 50 or so recommendations arising from the inquiry are aimed at addressing a number of problems identified in the course of our deliberations. It is important that we do not allow these problems to overshadow the positive factors influencing the growth of the environment industry. Australia has a skilled and educated work force, a well developed manufacturing infrastructure and a tradition of developing innovative technology or adapting technology developed elsewhere. An example of Australian industry moving to take advantage of emerging opportunities is the engineering group ANI, which has established joint ventures with European companies and has environmental contracts worth $2 billion in Europe. The company has predicted that environmental engineering could account for 50 per cent of its revenues by 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is encouraging that the impediments to the successful development of the environment industry are not an irrevocable part of the structure of the economy but result from poor coordination and a lack of commitment in areas of government, industry and commerce. Specific problems we have identified include the lack of national environmental standards, excessive complexity and inconsistent enforcement of regulations and lack of stable markets for recycled materials and less polluting energy sources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While recognising that state and local government authorities have major responsibilities for environmental matters, the committee nevertheless recommends that the Commonwealth take the leadership role by developing a national strategy for the Australian environmental industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Experience in the United States has shown that community right-to-know legislation has proved to be one of the most effective instruments available for reducing emissions. A major recommendation arising from this inquiry is that the Commonwealth quickly establishes a national pollution inventory as a community right-to-know measure. This measure would complement direct regulation processes and self-regulation by industry and, more importantly, it is likely to prompt companies to invest in cleaner production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth's fiscal powers could also be used to pursue environmental objectives. One measure examined by the committee was the introduction of tax on emissions of greenhouse gases in the form of a `carbon tax', possibly as a revenue substitute for payroll taxes. Consultants commissioned by the committee concluded that a prima facie case existed that the substitution of a carbon tax for payroll tax would have net economic benefits for Australia, but the evidence was not conclusive and so the committee recommends further study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The environmental problems facing rural Australia were recognised as being particularly severe and are being exacerbated by the ongoing drought. The committee was encouraged by the wide community acceptance of the national landcare program and has recommended substantially increased funding for the community landcare component of the program. There are also major employment opportunities in establishing and maintaining a national, comprehensive system of biodiversity reserves&mdash;as recommended in our previous report&mdash;and feral animal and weed control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has recommended a substantial number of actions to the Commonwealth. In essence these measures are aimed at clearing a way through obstacles, establishing coordinating mechanisms and providing additional financial support so that the environment management industry can take full advantage of the opportunities opening up here and in Asia. In so doing, jobs will be created and our environment protected and restored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to warmly thank the members of the committee for their cooperation and contribution to the inquiry and all those in industry and the community who prepared submissions and gave evidence. I also express strong appreciation to the committee secretariat for its support and work on this report. Ian Dundas, the committee secretary, managed the inquiry. Alan Burdon and Sue Irvine drafted the report and Marlene Lyons edited the report and arranged for its publication. Others made a vital, highly effective contribution to the completion of this important report. I commend the report to the House, and express the hope that the government will respond quickly to our recommendations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, for the pragmatic and informal way he managed these meetings and hearings which gave plenty of opportunity for other members of the committee to have all the input they wanted. Also, I congratulate the committee secretariat for the work it did in compiling what is quite a significant report on a very important subject.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee reference, hearings and final consideration made me focus more on the positive aspects of employment opportunities with sustainable development than had previously been the case. In the past, and at times now also, I had concerns about the negative impact on job opportunities of sustainable development's tough environmental standards because of the higher costs this creates in Australia whereby the products are too expensive for export or to compete against imports. But I have always been aware&mdash;and I believe that the committee inquiry made me far more aware&mdash;that if we are to have a sustainable future for our industries then action is required now to ensure that that will be the case. Hopefully&mdash;and this point was made from time to time during the hearings&mdash;those environmental requirements are sensible and are phased in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the developments since May 1993, it is obvious that more and more of the developed countries are requiring higher environmental standards for products that they import, and that we will have to meet those standards. Obviously it is sensible for us to meet those standards for our own sake as well as for meeting market opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are increasing opportunities for our service and manufacturing industries based in Australia as more and more countries elsewhere in the world lift their awareness and their standards, and we have some expertise that will be of help to them and good business for us. Recycling offers employment opportunities but is facing some significant problems in achieving the level we would all desire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But one of the really heartening developments, in my view, by average Australians over the last few years has been their awareness and their positive attitude to recycling household waste, particularly paper and plastics. However, that enthusiasm and cooperation could be lost. There are already some problems in regional areas because of the inability to have a market price or an economic demand that would sustain recycling at the local community level. So there is a need to create a market for recycled products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having recycling mandatory is no use if the material has to be dumped. So the government&mdash;one of the recommendations of the committee's report&mdash;needs to show a lead with its purchasing requirements, its purchasing contracts, for a sensible range of products where recycling of those materials would need to be an element. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Higher standards for our products are required overseas. Chernobyl, and the subsequent fallout right across Europe, was quite a turning point in consumers' attitudes in developed countries for what we are now promoting as Australian clean and green food. International standards are being applied more and more, whether they are Codex or World Health Organisation standards. There is a recognition that we do have some problems with our own standards in Australia: for example, most of our regional town water supplies do not meet World Health Organisation standards. There is a need to improve that partly for its own sake and partly to meet those market requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we value add to more of our products than we did in the past&mdash;and that is positive for job creation in itself&mdash;there is more and more effluent produced. There are now restrictions&mdash;and correctly so&mdash;on effluent disposal. We did learn of some examples of where it is possible to use the valuable nutrients from effluent to sensible purpose with job creation, forestry, et cetera. This has been done in my own area by the Goulburn Valley water authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Landcare has been and continues to be one of the great positives of this country. I have always commended the Australian Conservation Foundation and the National Farmers Federation for working together for its achievement. I claim my part when I was shadow minister for primary industries in ensuring that there was bipartisan support. I draw attention to some of the committee's recommendations that there is a need in real terms to increase the amount available for land care. The figures we are seeing at the moment are not accurate because they are now putting together the original national soil conservation program, which was the original landcare program, plus the water program and forestry items, which were separate items initially. Therefore, we need to pursue that and to recognise that even landcare does not cover the situation of sustainable agriculture on the farms themselves, and that has to be addressed in the future. I commend the committee's report to the parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gave me a great deal of pleasure to participate in the Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts which has produced the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working with the environment: opportunities for job growth</EMPHASIS>. Like the previous speaker, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), I would like to congratulate the chairman, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), for his leadership and the continual reminder that we had to get the job done. We certainly did get the job done. I would also like to thank the staff for their outstanding commitment to the task that we had.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report enunciates a number of issues about the environment, and we make many recommendations. I would like to think that it will not be seen simply as rhetoric but hopefully as a guide to a sustainable future, because there can be no doubt that many of our industrial practices, both primary and secondary, in Australia today are not sustainable. As a nation we are placing greater pressure on the environment through population growth, particularly along our coastal fringe. Through the drive for industry to be competitive on an international basis it is very easy to overlook the cost to our environment. We all know that once we have destroyed certain environmental features we cannot get them back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While some of the industrial excursions left us quite invigorated with the feeling that some of our industries are attacking sustainability head-on&mdash;and there is no doubt that they are winning&mdash;there were many occasions when frustration showed through and the inertia of inefficient and non-sustainable practices was just too hard to overcome. The state of industry in Australia today shows that some large industries simply do not try to be environmentally responsible citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One industry that has enormous potential in my electorate is the production of ethanol from woody tissue. This industry poses a great future not only for the people of my electorate but for the whole of Australia and indeed for the whole of the world because it is new technology. It will allow a renewable energy resource to be used to provide a fuel that does not depend on fossil fuels and will not be adding to greenhouse gas because it uses current crop biomass. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is committed to it; the opposition is committed to it. APACE Research, which gave evidence to our committee, and its chief chemist Dr Russell Reeves is certainly committed to it. But the biggest user of the raw timber resource in New South Wales, Boral Timber, has walked away from it. This is a company that has recently had its woodchip licence increased by half a million tonnes. When companies such as this are not prepared to participate, to take the opportunity to develop new technology, one has to question the value of a report such as this. When large industry, with the enormous resources it has, would not even give $2 million to a project that can turn around the liquid fuel industry in the world, we must really question its objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is in a unique position to develop alternative energy sources, be it solar, wind, biomass or other forms of energy yet to be devised. Unfortunately, because of our relatively cheap sources of energy&mdash;coal and crude oil&mdash;we have become one of the biggest per capita producers of greenhouse gasses in the world today. As a nation, we have learnt to abuse the processes of nature in this vast and beautiful land of ours. I sincerely hope that our report might convince some of the industrial giants in Australia and some of the bureaucrats in government departments that we have a duty to future generations of Australians to move towards sustainability, because that is the only way that we will have a future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on this report of the Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts. I would like to congratulate the chairman, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), the secretariat and also the other members for their contributions. When we look at the terms of reference of the report, we see that it was a fairly wide-ranging inquiry. As we went through the submissions and conducted visits around Australia to discuss matters with many people, I think we realised how enormous the particular task of environmental job growth was going to be and how broad ranging it really was.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The environmental industry, to my mind, is a real growth area in Australia, along with the information technology industry. One of the things we have to realise in Australia is the importance of our environment. For instance, by the year 2040 we may have a doubling of our population. Unless we start to address environmental issues now, who knows what the state of our country will be in 2040. So the importance of the environment to the whole social welfare debate in Australia is very important. I hope this report continues the process of debate and discussion on these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do we need an environment debate and why do we need an environmental industry? If we look at human degradation around the world, we realise that it is a very important issue. For instance, the World Wildlife Fund no longer only looks after threatened animal species around the world; it also educates people to try to change their way of life in order to help the sustainability of threatened animals. So we are now looking to the people of the world&mdash;homo sapiens&mdash;to change our whole living process and rethink what we do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report identified a number of areas in which Australia is at the leading edge of technology in relation to a lot of environmental industries. I think that is quite good. One area in which I believe we can work is recycling. Recycling at the local level is very good, but unfortunately we do not know how to actually handle it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We went to a plant in Melbourne to discuss the recycling of plastic milk bottles. The workers there were doing a very good job; they were producing products which were very good. But, unfortunately, the market for end products is not around. We have to start rethinking our whole process in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three points which are very important. Ecotourism is an area that is growing in Australia. It lacks regulation, which we address in this report. A lot of people should be taking a serious look at the ecotourism industry and trying to regulate and protect it. Many operators are moving into the area and calling themselves ecotourist operators, which may not be helpful to the environment. As we attract tourists to Australia, we should have a more serious regulatory look at what we do in ecotourism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also addresses carbon tax. I favour a carbon tax because I think the user-pays principle is good, but only on the basis that it replaces other taxes. It cannot be a disincentive to employment; it must be used as an incentive to employment. In our recommendations we look to replace payroll tax in states; therefore, a new tax on carbon may be beneficial only if it replaces other taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last thing I want to talk about is the Western Australian government. We have a recommendation in the report about the WA government joining the national body. There has been a lot of debate in Western Australia recently about the WA government not wanting to do so. Recently, on 14 November, the minister in Western Australia said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This issue is about ensuring that the power to manage environmental issues in this State remains where it should be&mdash;in the hands of West Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think anyone in the community would doubt that. Environmental issues really have to go down to the basic core area of our community: local government, which needs support from state and federal governments. But, in my mind, the whole benefit of our recommendation to the WA government is that the Western Australian government should be leading on environmental issues. By moving into a national forum, it can contribute by leading on these issues. To promote the standards that the Western Australian government projects, rather than being seen as a negative, they should be seen as a positive and, therefore, held up to the rest of the country. The Western Australian government should not necessarily see it as a negative step but more as a positive step. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times there have been a lot of reports about the environment with recommendations as to what we should be doing. I think that, slowly, support for these reports is becoming more popular in the community. We should address the environment for the future not only relating to our needs right now but certainly relating to the needs that will exist in 40 or 50 years time when there will be a huge demand on the Australian environment. We should be looking at ways in which to control it. If we do not do so, we may not save it for future generations, which is the whole purpose of this report. Although the report refers to employment, it really talks about our future. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with my colleagues from the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts in commending this report to the parliament. I congratulate the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) as chair of the committee. If it were not for his interest not only in matters economic but matters environmental, perhaps we would not have had this inquiry. He deserves congratulations for bringing it forward as part of the committee's work and bringing the report to the parliament. I also congratulate the staff of the committee. As usual, they have done a stirling job in providing not only the research backup but also the secretarial administrative backup. As the chairman said, this report perhaps calls for nothing short of a paradigm shift in society's attitude to the relationship between employment and the environment. Whilst this report puts forward 54 recommendations, I do not think any of us would see this as being the end of the continuing discussion there needs to be on these issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is often assumed that protecting the environment costs jobs. Unfortunately, over the last two centuries since the Industrial Revolution, many have believed this to be true. The Industrial Revolution in Britain and Europe developed at an astronomical pace, without the slightest concern for the despoliation of the environment. If we take the industrial north of England, we see that thousands of factory chimneys poured smoke into the atmosphere and thousands of factories discharged industrial waste directly into the rivers, all with a wanton disregard for their impact on the environment. Eighteenth century legislation providing some protection to employees was wiped off the statute books in the name of the new fashionable ideas of political economy which saw regulation as anathema. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Protection of the environment was not a consideration. Legislators and factory owners were prepared to place their faith in the inexhaustible capacity of nature. It is no wonder that 150 years later people believe that it costs jobs to regulate industrial output. I quote from the honourable member for Fraser's book with John Quiggin&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the long run, the real choice is not jobs or the environment. It's both or neither. What kind of jobs will be possible in a world of depleted resources, poisoned water and foul air, a world where ozone depletion and greenhouse warming make it difficult even to survive?</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is an important encapsulation of the issues that confronted the committee and confront society as we continue to debate the problems that this report covers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the issues that has been raised by previous speakers in their comments on the committee inquiry is the need for environmental standards. The honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) has acknowledged, as we have in our recommendation, the need for the Western Australian government to perhaps reconsider its position on some of those issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As our report says, environmental degradation is a national problem, and we were urged as a committee, and urged to recommend to government, that measures for its alleviation be pursued on a national scale. It would be most unfortunate and irresponsible for opportunities for job creation in the environment industry to be hindered by any lack of commitment by the Commonwealth and state governments to national strategies. So what we see as yet another policy issue where we are calling for national strategies is cooperation between those elements that make up the federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another way of looking at what we have to do in this debate is the consideration of the effects that it has in generational terms. We have that terminology `intergenerational equity'. In a paper prepared by Denis Hanley, who is a member of the Prime Minister's Science and Engineering Council and chairman of Memtec Ltd, it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly today GNP per capita which is often used to compare national wealth does not adequately express the wealth of a nation. However, when assessed in conjunction with a national valuation of the nation's environmental endowment, it provides a more accurate picture of national wealth and would explain why citizens of places such as Australia might prefer to live here as compared with other nations which although possessing higher GNP per capita have a lesser environmental endowment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to join with other speakers and thank all the participators in the inquiry of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, particularly the chairman, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), and the staff. The issue of unemployment is much talked about in this place, and I think previous speakers have covered many aspects of it in relation to the environment. The area that I choose to highlight today is point 1.3 in the introduction of the report, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problems of unemployment are particularly severe in rural and remote Australia due to a large extent to the changing nature of the farming industry and its impact on rural employment.</PARA>
<PARA>In the report the Anglican Social Responsibilities Commission of Western Australia is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rural poverty is often overlooked, the poor in the bush are the hidden poor . . . The traditional role of male farm labourer has largely disappeared and has not been replaced, this creates a range of pressures in families and communities . . . The picture for young people growing up in rural Australia is bleak . . . Young rural people who leave school to seek work are faced with an ever diminishing labour market. This is accentuated further if he/ she does not want to leave their home town.</PARA>
<PARA>That issue is acknowledged on page 1 of the report. I would suggest that in the last decade or so the most interesting thing that has occurred in environmental issues is the fundamental shift that has occurred in rural communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there is an acknowledgment in the report of changing opinion throughout the community&mdash;nowhere has it been stronger than in the rural and regional communities&mdash;to an acknowledgment that our resources are finite and that we have a responsibility to future generations. The former shadow minister, in his work with the ACF and NFF coalition on land care, was very much part of that, as was I in a regional sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can remember Phillip Toyne and Rick Farley being in a local hotel in my home town in about 1988. We were in the middle of one of the toughest droughts&mdash;it is tough enough now, but this was equal to it&mdash;and about 100 people from across the Eyre Peninsula accepted the Toyne-Farley proposition put that day that we needed to address the issue of land care. So, on that day, six or seven years ago, that decision was unanimously taken in my region. There was a fundamental shift, and this report continues that ethos. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very positive report. Whilst there are some negative components, as there always will be, this report addresses the problems in a very positive tenor. It has been a privilege to serve on the committee, although it was for only a short time. I remember visiting `the smelter day in the park' at Portland and, if ever I saw a more fundamental shift in philosophy or approach to the environment, I saw it there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude on the issue of land care. We made the recommendation that the amount given for land care be doubled to $200 million over the next three years and that those areas suffering from drought get priority. There will always be debate about these things, particularly when it goes to Treasury or the cabinet, or to whomever the responsible person might be. I suggest that the great challenge is to harness the resources of every individual in this country, particularly in relation to land care. This may not necessarily be set in concrete, but we need to offer the maximum incentives. If that cannot be in the form of grants, perhaps we need to have a more lateral thinking process whereby we include all members of the community&mdash;all Australians&mdash;wherever they live under the land care philosophy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with my colleagues in commending the report that has been presented here today so ably by the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore). I pay tribute to his chairmanship and leadership in producing a report which has been accepted enthusiastically by all members of the committee. I also thank members of the committee staff for their fine efforts in assisting us in the preparation of the report and for the work they have put into producing the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably the most telling thing about the report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working with the environment: opportunities for job growth</EMPHASIS>, is that in some ways it is a quiet document. It does not come in with a great deal of fanfare, and it does not lead in with a degree of headline grabbing issues such as the numbers of available jobs or jobs likely to be lost and so forth. It goes to the heart of the matters that affect the environment and shows where the jobs are in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the report is sincere. It does not attempt to portray itself as something which it is not. It is sincere in attempting to bring the issues to the attention of members of parliament and to make people who read the report aware of some of the issues and conflicts in both the industry and the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Various speakers this afternoon have already alluded to some of the conflicts within their electorates and some of the anomalies that this report covers.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recommend that when people are reading the report they look at the changes that are occurring, especially regarding pollution control. Too often, even in the area of pollution control and other areas, there is a reluctance to move towards a higher standard, and a reluctance to allow industry and other bodies to take up some of the challenges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As those industries become unsustainable or uneconomic and drop out of the economy, the taxpayer is then left to pick up the mess or the tab. I think that is regrettable. What is involved in the report all the way through is a positive approach to this and a positive way of getting that sea change or, as it has been referred to, that paradigm of change within society to address the issues so that, instead of having the dog chasing the tail, we actually get out there and assist industry and make it possible for industry to change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On pollution control, the committee recommended that national environmental standards should be outcome oriented rather than process oriented, stringent and rigorously based on scientific grounds. I refer to the recommendation on page 48 of the report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While command and control regulations still have an important role in controlling small waste dischargers without the technical capability to properly manage wastes, more flexible regulatory approaches to pollution control can greatly promote economic growth in specific industry sectors and effectively reduce pollution.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee also agreed with the view, expressed in several submissions, that regulations should be outcome oriented rather than that process oriented role that I spoke about. In terms of waste management and recycling of material, again the committee was as one when it said that there should be an agreement that a percentage of recyclable material should be included in any product where it is possible, and certainly the government's purchasing policies should also take that into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect of land management has obviously been mentioned by my colleague the member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) and others, that is, the role of landcare groups and the government funding that has gone into that. I did make a comment that in some ways we are fixing up past misdeeds. We certainly have gone a long way, and I commend the government and the opposition for their support for what we have done with land care and the role that it actually plays in educating society and bringing about the sorts of changes that are most necessary. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The cost that the farmers have to pay to put power onto those farms is around $50,000 per farm to connect to the grid. We could have done exactly the same thing with about $20,000 of solar cells and associated electronic componentry. It is a disgrace that we are taking power out there, putting up all these lines and power poles, when we could be producing the solar cells in Australia, producing the electronic equipment and putting them into those outback farms.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)notes the difficulties that GATT-produced tax changes pose for the Australian citrus industry; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)recognises the need for the (a) introduction of a range of tax changes and/or compensation packages to allow the citrus industry to maximise its export potential and (b) maintenance of the Uruguay Round of trade reform as it advances the opportunities for all exporters in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>I enter the House and this debate with a somewhat prejudiced point of view. Most of my working life has been spent in the citrus industry and, as a member of parliament, I still have a small interest in the industry and therefore a direct interest in the outcome of the concerns that are currently before the parliament. The parliament should be aware of my interest, not because I think it particularly prejudices my point of view but because I hope it means that I come into this debate with at least some background information on the industry and what it is currently facing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also come into this House acknowledging my indebtedness to the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest), who is in the House and planning to second this motion, and the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Hicks). They have been colleagues in representing the industry. The three of us can claim, immodestly, to have been very loyal to the government's point of view from an opposition perspective. That will get me into some trouble with the citrus growers, but the government should recognise that, while we, as opposition members, have been tempted to find all sorts of short cut solutions to the industry's problem which would have embarrassed the government, we have in each of our electorates to date avoided just that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We call on the government to recognise the dilemma that citrus growers face. We also call on the government to introduce some form of compensation package as rapidly as possible because the compensation package promised has now been delayed for something like five weeks and looks like being delayed another two weeks. This uncertainty is causing the citrus industry a great deal of stress because growers simply do not know what the government is going to do and therefore anticipates the worst, and this very negative anticipation is being reflected currently in market prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People not familiar with the industry may wonder what the GATT induced changes are that are so impacting on the citrus industry. It is very simple. The fruit juice industry in Australia has long had an arrangement with the government where any fruit juice product containing more than 25 per cent pure Australian juice was taxed at 11 per cent and any fruit juice product containing less than 25 per cent pure Australian juice was taxed at 21 per cent. So there was a deliberate incentive to use pure Australian juice in any fruit juice drink in order to get the tax advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, under the GATT arrangements, where we indicate that we will be traders who will trade as fairly and as equitably as possible, it is simply not defensible for us to go on with a tax advantage that deliberately favours Australian products. So the government, recognising its tax obligations, has introduced into this House legislation which says that it will no longer be proper for a tax advantage to be given to processors who use more than 25 per cent Australian juice in their fruit juice drink. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead, any processer who uses any juice from any source, as long as it is pure fruit juice to make up more than 25 per cent of a particular drink product, will get the tax advantage of 11 per cent. So there is no longer going to be an advantage for Australian growers. Australian growers are rightly saying to the government, `We as growers are not very fond of GATT. We recognise, however, that across Australia GATT does a great deal more for the nation than it costs and therefore needs to be supported.' For that reason, the growers are saying not that they are resisting this change they do not like but that they are seeking from the government some indication that in an appropriate way it will compensate citrus growers for these disadvantages. We are waiting for an indication of just what that compensation package will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the Australian citrus industry have said that it would be reasonable for the government to take 100 per cent pure juice product and give it no sales tax at all. That is the compensation they are seeking. It is not a plea for a particular recognition to the citrus industry; it is a plea for nothing more than tax equity. After all, the government already takes 100 per cent pure juice product&mdash;I use the term loosely&mdash;in the form of milk and says, `This is a food and therefore will be tax exempt.' Citrus growers are saying, `If it is good enough for pure milk to be tax exempt, it is good enough for pure fruit juice to be tax exempt as well.' Frankly, what is the difference? Both are regarded as food items. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Citrus growers are being very reasonable. They are not asking for a tax exemption on a product that is not pure juice. They are saying, `If what we are producing is not being processed in pure form, it should carry some sort of sales tax, just as any other beverage does.' But in the case of what can legitimately be said to be a pure juice product and therefore food, let us treat it as a food from a taxation point of view, and offer it tax exemption. Of course, this would apply not just to Australian fruit juice but to imported fruit juice as well. It would mean the Brazilian product coming in here as 100 per cent product would also be tax exempt. Australian citrus growers are saying that is fair enough. That is the sort of handicap they have to recognise under GATT but under the legislation the government has before the House we and the Brazilians would all be taxed at 11 per cent. Given the importance that Australian consumers place on fruit juice as a form of beverage, growers ought to be able to treat it as if it were milk and get it sales tax free. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This ought to be a matter of some embarrassment to the government because its own horticulture task force, set up by the government to determine what was in the interests of horticulture across Australia and chaired by Senator Nick Sherry, came out with a recommendation that said, `Any 100 per cent juice product ought to be tax exempt.' We are simply asking the government to pick up the recommendation of its task force in the interests in this instance of citrus growers, but also in the interests of horticulturalists right across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why are we propounding what we believe is in horticulture's best interest? It is because horticulture is one of those industries that offers the government great opportunities to increase our export earnings and decrease our balance of payments deficit. For too long there has been this popular view that the citrus industry is some sort of peasant industry coming to the government begging for a handout. It is wrong to have that perception. Everyone should be aware of the fact that the Australian citrus industry that finds it so difficult to compete with the Brazilians in the production of juice is the same industry that takes whole oranges and puts them in cartons and sells them, without any government assistance at all, into the Asian markets, the New Zealand market and even, if you please, into the United States market off-season in the face of competition from around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry can claim to be efficient by world standards and to grow a quality product that is appealing and delectable. It can be put in a carton and despatched around the world making money for growers and the government without government assistance. What the industry cannot do, and neither can the industry in California or Florida, is compete with the Brazilians who have become the world leaders in the production of juice and who, frankly, are flooding markets around the world with frozen orange juice concentrate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry is saying, let us recognise that if we are going to put fruit in cartons we will finish up with some sort of overrun because, inevitably, producing fruit of export quality or of sufficient quality to put on the fresh market in Australia means that some fruit will be not substandard, as the essence will be as pure as any other fruit, but will be scarred or marked and will not be appealing to the consumer and therefore will need to find another home. That juice, in Australian terms, will become part of juice production. In the current environment, the Brazilians dictate the price for juice fruit in Australia and a depressed juice price means a depressed price for whole fruit on the fresh market and the export market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government would act to offer the sort of sales tax regime that the industry is seeking&mdash;that is, no sales tax on the 100 per cent product, as recommended by Nick Sherry, one of the government's own senators&mdash;we would have a situation in which, frankly, we would provide a base juice market on which the local fresh fruit market and the export market could be built. The proposal that the industry puts to the government is not pain free; it still means a great deal of adjustment. It means the industry still has to focus increasingly on the export market but it gives the industry the opportunity for the first time to compete, in juice terms, around the world. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">notes the difficulties that GATT-produced tax changes pose for the Australian citrus industry . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) will find much argument from this side of the House to the proposition. He will certainly not find much opposition from me. Members of the government are already well aware of the difficulties that our compliance with GATT can bring to the citrus industry and other industries as well. There has already been considerable work done to come up with a range of measures to help the industry overcome those difficulties. The member for Wakefield has mentioned some of those already. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dairy industry, which is very strong in my area, has also had to make some adjustments as a result of our taking up the Uruguay Round of GATT trade reforms. Other industries are consulting with the government as well. The dairy industry has had good consultation with the government over many years on various matters. The last package of reform that went through when John Kerin was the minister was very well received. Now it is negotiating with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, to come up with a package of reforms which will enable the industry to move forward in the last years of the 20th century and into the 21st century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I have not been intimately involved with the citrus industry&mdash;unlike the member for Wakefield I do not have to declare a vested interest in the citrus industry&mdash;I nevertheless have an interest in it. I come from a rural and provincial seat and I lived in the Riverina area for a number of years some years ago. As I understand it, a proposal on the GATT reform packages was to go before cabinet last week but was postponed because of other pressing business. I can assure the member for Wakefield that it still remains a priority for cabinet consideration. The government is well aware of the problems confronting the industry because of the changes to GATT and will be doing all it can, while remaining consistent with GATT, to assist that industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those members who are not aware of the implications of GATT to the citrus industry, I will give a very brief picture. Currently, the Australian citrus industry sells a large percentage of its product as juice concentrate and receives a tax advantage over juice concentrates that are imported. Such preferential tax treatment, which the government has quite generously given over the last few years, is illegal under the agreed GATT provisions and will have to be removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This means that we will be competing on equal terms with our overseas competitors who are likely to gain some advantage because of their lower wage structures. The industry itself fears we would lose considerable domestic market penetration because of the increased competition. Currently, some 60 per cent of our domestic production of oranges goes into concentrate. So it is clear that losses in this area would have a considerable impact on the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard some in the industry say we should be ignoring the changes to GATT and keeping the existing taxation arrangements in place. Clearly, with so many advantages for Australia in adopting the GATT guidelines, that is not an option. I am pleased that members of the opposition here this morning, including the member for Wakefield, have not been party to those sorts of calls and have refuted that sort of a basis for action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the government recognises that there will be problems for the industry as a result of these changes. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and his parliamentary secretary, Senator Nick Sherry, have been working closely with the industry to develop measures which will help growers over the current hurdle. These measures are due to go to cabinet very soon. Until they have been through cabinet and approved, and until they have been considered by the industry, it is premature to be talking here today about compensation packages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the details of the government's program are known and before the industry has had time to consider them, it is clearly premature for the coalition to be attempting measures of its own. My call to the honourable member is this: wait and see what the cabinet and the government develop and then discuss the measures with the industry and, if it is not happy or the coalition has any ongoing concerns, come back to us and we will see what can be done to accommodate the remaining areas of concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the member's motion says that this House should consider measures to maximise the industry's export potential. People will certainly find no argument from me or anyone else on this side of the House with those sentiments. It is clear that substantial market opportunities are available, particularly in the fresh juice export area. Anyone who has tasted the difference between orange juice from concentrates and fresh orange juice knows that there is no comparison in quality or taste. This is an area where Australia has a competitive geographical advantage. The Asian and the South Pacific markets for fresh products are growing enormously. With proper industry planning and direction plus government support, we will capture much greater slices of these markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having just come back from Japan some two weeks ago, I think there certainly is opportunity in terms of the price and the quality of fruit there. For example, a mandarin or orange that I would consider to be of poor quality is selling for the equivalent of about $1. Fruit of better quality is being sold for about $2 to $3. In comparing the quality of Japan's fruit with that of our nation, I would say that the $1 mandarin is the sort of fruit that we might get at a well-known department store in Canberra on Sunday at about 10 o'clock at night. The better quality fruit obviously we might pick up during the day when the fresh supply of market comes in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much government support is already available. A $2 million program to promote the benefits of fresh juice is under way, and we are involved in a half-million dollar campaign to reduce the pest risk, which has closed many of our market opportunities in America and other potential fresh fruit or juice markets. Just last week Senator Collins announced in the Senate details of an innovative agricultural marketing program allocation to the Original Juice Co., as it is called. This company will receive some $900,000 to help it with the production and export of a premium 100 per cent fresh orange juice product with an extended shelf life. The company has been instrumental in developing a fresh juice sector in Australia and is now hoping to enter Asian markets. The use of innovative processing and packaging techniques will enable the shelf life of the product to be significantly extended. This has important advantages and cost savings in relation to both transport and storage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are already part way through a program which aims to eradicate fruit fly. The advantages of success here cannot be underestimated, as I am sure the member for Wakefield is aware. Last year Senator Sherry's horticultural task force report estimated that the value of Australian horticultural exports could treble by the year 2000 and be worth some $2 billion. This was to occur largely through growth in both Asian and American markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Australian horticultural sector is to take up a major share of these expanding markets and realise the vision developed by the horticultural task force, there is a real urgency for us to tackle impediments to growth in exports. One of the major impediments to growth in fresh fruit exports is the existence of fruit fly in some of our major horticulture producing areas. I understand that areas in South Australia have been able to take advantage of being declared free of fruit fly and have already seen considerable expansion of their export numbers to areas in America.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is history now that the task force endorsed the working group's recommendations and that the Commonwealth government in its last budget agreed to contribute some $595,000 over four years to that important initiative. There is no doubt from the Commonwealth government's point of view that successful implementation of the tri-state fruit fly strategy will lead to increased export opportunities for Australian fresh fruit exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A range of other government programs are available to help those primary industries which compete internationally. The agrifood policy is a good example of that policy. The measures in the 1992 agrifood statement are designed to be industry driven, to foster international competitiveness and value adding, and certainly to position Australia as a major and stable international supplier of processed and fresh food. Particular focus is on the expanding Asian markets with, for example, emphasis on niche markets, brand name packaging and further processing within Australia before export. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The clean food export strategy is another example of policies to actually develop those commercial linkages. The strategy is designed to  enhance Australia's image as a supplier of clean, fresh quality produce in overseas markets. It is based on creating a market advantage for Australian fresh and processed food on the basis of its quality and origin from a clean environment. The program is a joint initiative with industry and government funding and is conditional on matching industry funds. The government has given many programs of assistance to the citrus industry. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew, it is interesting that you should be in the chair while your motion is being debated. It is a bit like preaching to the converted. So, through you, I address my remarks to members of the government. I listened very carefully to the contribution of the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell). I was keen to hear him say, `Wait and see about the government's response.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole parliament and the government need to recognise what is being asked of citrus growers. They need to bear in mind that the citrus task force report referred to by the member for Wakefield first came to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) in January 1994. That was 11 months ago. How long is long enough? That situation has created uncertainty for citrus growers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am hoping that the government speakers who follow will reassure me that this industry is not being treated in any way contemptuously. The government knew that the enabling legislation that is currently before the Senate&mdash;it has passed through this House&mdash;was coming. It also knew that it had a citrus task force report before it, ready and waiting for due consideration, to address the needs of that enabling legislation to satisfy the GATT and a whole range of other problems confronting citrus. We are today advised that that task force's recommendations will go before cabinet on 28 November. I have personally been waiting since last month for the response from the government on this task force report. I make a plea to those government members who have anything to do with this to ensure that 28 November is the date that the package goes to cabinet for approval. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Citrus growers call me at home and address me in my office. They have waited long enough. The citrus industry is not grumbling or complaining. It has seen the impact of the trade reform that has occurred over a number of years. As the honourable member for Wakefield said in his contribution, the industry has responded to the challenge that has been asked of it by both sides of this parliament. Both sides have given bipartisan support for the Uruguay Round and getting the GATT up, and acquiescence was given to the legislation when it was before this chamber. We all agreed about the necessity for the GATT to be in place. We did so for two reasons. Not only is GATT for the benefit of our very important industries but also the rules associated with the GATT can finally be used to our advantage. </PARA>

The honourable member for Wakefield has made clear the rationale  and the argument to support such a proposition. The industry needs a decent package which assists the industry to benchmark so that it can procure the objectives to sustain its future and gain recognition of the importance of this citrus industry to regional development. </PARA>

I do not condemn the government in any way, but I simply urge it not to defer the response to the task force any longer. The task force has made some very worthwhile recommendations. Citrus growers in my electorate are looking for support so that they can get on with the job that this parliament has given them; exporting, being efficient, and competing on an ever-shrinking world market.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I fully support the proposition that the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) has put on behalf of the citrus growers of Australia. There is no doubt at all that food beverages, be they milk or pure fruit juices, should be treated equally under the taxation system. Because of the changes introduced by GATT, Australian citrus growers should be relieved of the 11 per cent sales tax currently being imposed on Australian fruit juices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, I believe that there are other things that the citrus industry needs to do. As chairman of the Melbourne Wholesale Fruit and Vegetable Market Trust which runs the Melbourne wholesale market, I was horrified to find that, under the by-laws of the Melbourne Wholesale Fruit and Vegetable Market Trust Act, growers of citrus products in Australia are prohibited from selling citrus products on the floor at the Melbourne market. It is the only horticultural product grown in Australia which growers are prevented from selling direct to retailers at the Melbourne market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Melbourne market is the largest grower market in Australia. Every trading day 640 stalls are made available for growers of horticultural and vegetable products. Most of those stands are utilised by two or more growers in sequential arrangements. So we have well over 2,000 growers who sell direct to the retail trade in Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was puzzled as to why a grower of citrus would be forced to go through a wholesaler to get his product into retail shops in Melbourne. As chairman of the trust, I arranged a meeting with members of the citrus industry in Mildura&mdash;in the electorate of the honourable member for Forrest. I tried to move to change the by-laws to allow growers to have the option of selling on the floor of the market. To my horror, I was fairly roundly abused by citrus growers because they really want to sell through a citrus marketing board&mdash;in this day and age, would you believe!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as I am aware, those by-laws are still in existence at Melbourne markets. Growers from South Australia and the Riverina are still prevented by the by-law from travelling to Melbourne, parking their trucks at the Melbourne market and selling their own produce straight off the backs of their trucks. It is a nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time that the citrus industry got rid of this rather quaint marketing notion that somehow it is better off having the wholesaling of its produce controlled by a board. In my own experience, and through my understanding, of the industry I have found that that only assists some large growers. It does very little for the family farm. It does very little for growers who want to produce a different product: because it is controlled by a marketing board primarily controlled by large growers, small family groups are forced into producing the product which the larger growers want to produce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I tried to get the by-law amended, the then Minister for Agriculture in Victoria, Ian Baker&mdash;a fairly useless individual who did very little for anyone in the state of Victoria&mdash;also abused me quite roundly. I found that, from both a governmental and an industry viewpoint, moves which were designed to assist small family farmers and small citrus growers to have access to the retail market were soundly defeated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) and the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) to talk to their citrus boards and their growers to try to get some more rational approach. If the citrus industry really wants to flourish, it really should open up the rights of growers to sell as they see fit.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)recognises the 50th anniversary of the Bretton Woods Institution by acknowledging both the value of the achievements of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund and the costs of their misjudgments; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)calls for the establishment of an intergovernmental committee with broad representation along the lines of the Committee of Twenty for the task of reconsidering the functioning of the international financial institutions after 50 years and their future role in the dramatically different world economy from that in which they were founded with a view to improving their effectiveness, their coverage and their democratic covenants.</PARA>
<PARA>The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have just celebrated at their annual meetings in Madrid the 50th anniversary of their establishment. This is therefore an appropriate time to consider, as suggested in the motion, the value of their achievements and the costs of their misjudgments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The world is at an economic watershed. For the last two decades we have been cursed with a particularly narrow approach to economic policy making, especially in the English speaking industrial countries. Reduction of inflation has been given pre-eminence over every other macro-economic goal, there has been absolute faith in the efficacy of unimpeded markets and there has been an obsession with efficiency and a neglect of equity. Social goals have commonly been relegated to insignificance. The core target of fiscal policy has been cutting public outlays and taxation on higher incomes. The Reagan and Thatcher governments were the clearest examples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The results are evident for all to see. There have been some benefits. Inflation is now generally low and productivity has improved, although not by nearly as much as would have been desirable. But there have also been severe costs. There has generally been a major increase in unemployment, an increase in the concentration of economic power and a deterioration in the equity in the distribution of income and wealth. Unemployment, poverty and homelessness are manifest on the streets of all major cities in countries which have adopted this fundamentalist stance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have been active advocates of this approach. They have been impelled to do so by some of their more powerful member governments, and have also been advised to do so by the majority of their professional advisers. As well, the fund and the bank do not act as global institutions: they concentrate their policies on current account deficit, developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Western hike in interest rates beginning in 1979 and the consequent crisis in debtor countries enhanced the leverage of the fund and the bank. Under the rubric of structural adjustment they imposed contractionary, deregulatory and inequitable policies on deficit countries. The success of these adjustment programs has been very limited indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the 55 developing countries in which these policies were used between 1980 and 1989, 27 experienced a decline in per capita income and, in another 13, external imbalance and debt continued to be unsustainably high. Yet, in another seven, there was clear evidence of declining social indicators. In Brazil the investment rate declined disastrously, severely reducing prospects for sustainable growth. Of the 55 adjusting countries, only seven appear to have adjusted successfully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aware of these and other related issues, the Australian parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade conducted an inquiry into the bank and the fund in 1991 through to 1993. The committee made many recommendations aimed at increasing the openness of the fund and bank's activities. For example, we recommended that an interparliamentary assembly be establish to monitor the fund and the bank. To keep such an assembly manageable, we recommended that it meet annually and that membership be limited to two members from each of the national parliaments of the countries providing the executive directors of the fund and the bank in that year. The first such meeting is being sponsored by the US Congress and is being held in Washington next Monday, 21 November. This Australian initiative has been adopted by the global community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary committee also strongly recommended that poverty alleviation be the focus of all structural adjustment lending and that the environment, land redistribution and the reduction in population growth rates receive higher priority. We also supported a new issue of  special drawing rights by the fund, a recommendation which was discussed at the Madrid annual meetings. We also suggested that, in order to increase the finance available to the bank, it be empowered to borrow more than the value of its capital base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary committee noted that in recent years the bank has been attempting to learn from past experience and to ensure that safety nets are available so that the poorest groups are not disadvantaged by structural adjustment loans. We could not find evidence, however, that the same is true of the fund. We wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From the evidence presented it is clear that although considerable work remains to be done, the Bank is moving, albeit slowly, in the right direction to alleviate the impact of its adjustment policies on the poor. However the same cannot be said about the Fund. Australia should therefore endeavour to raise the issues of poverty . . . with the Fund at every appropriate opportunity . . . The Committee recommends that the government strive within the Fund to achieve a poverty alleviation focus in structural adjustment lending. Within the Bank the government should press for full implementation of the Bank's poverty alleviation policies . . . and for more resources to be directed to evaluating the poverty impact of these loans.</PARA>
<PARA>We proposed that the annual report of the Treasurer to parliament detail more fully how such recommendations might be implemented. The experience with structural adjustment lending demonstrates the danger of policies with goals which are too narrow, involving concentrating on improving efficiency and neglecting equity and giving too little attention to development&mdash;for this leads to increasing poverty in equity and unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important lesson of the 1980s is about the importance of aiming for simultaneous achievement of goals, of increasing efficiency and equity, of reducing inflation and unemployment, of increasing economic development and of enhancing ecological sustainability. This is clearly a complex task but it is essential to attempt to balance those goals if effective sustainable policy is to eventuate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Conversations with politicians in other countries suggest that they have the same difficulty in dealing with international financial issues that we have in Australia. That is, these issues are kept tightly controlled by treasury and finance departments and that, given the lack of interest in these issues in the wider community, there is little incentive&mdash;let alone opportunity&mdash;for politicians to take them up. That is why a debate like this is really important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Global pressure for change is starting to increase. A clear symptom of this pressure is the agreement by the United Nations to hold the World Summit for Social Development. Institutional arrangements and policies of the international, economic and financial institutions are amongst the concerns which led to support for holding the social summit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is widespread recognition of the gaping hole in international economic policy making structures. That is why one of the issues on the agenda for the social summit is upgrading the economic and social council of the United Nations. It has been proposed that an executive committee be established within it which would meet in continuous session and which would have on its agenda the principal global economic problems, such as macro-economic coordination, the volatility of exchange rates, trade, investment and development finance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New institutional arrangements are certainly required. It is also important to find some ways of reducing the power of the international financial markets to set national economic and social agendas. So a very important issue which is being suggested by our Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) and Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) is the possibility of a small foreign exchange levy. This would have the effect of discouraging very short-term speculation, reducing the power of financial markets to set national agendas, reducing exchange rate volatility and generating revenue for national governments and the international community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to imaginatively examine such policies within the context of the fund so that its effectiveness can be increased. A reluctance to seriously consider such reforms is one reason for the excessive reliance on structural adjustment lending. A more comprehensive, genuinely global adjustment strategy is required in order to facilitate faster economic and social development within developing countries. At a time when the bank estimates that the number of people living in absolute poverty is well over 1,000 million people, nothing else is adequate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The signing of the Bretton Woods agreement in 1944 was an extraordinary leap of faith. Only three weeks after the D-day landings, financial experts met in a small town in New Hampshire and mapped out a new monetary system for the postwar world. They established a monetary framework of fixed exchange rates based on freedom of trade and currency movements to replace the anarchy of the 1930s; founded a new bank to replace the international capital markets, which had been killed off by the defaults induced by the Great Depression; and laid the foundations for the greatest half century of expansion the world has ever known.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bretton Woods is not just an economic milestone. The economic growth and increase in international living standards it delivered and their implications have influenced all facets of our lives since the Second World War. In 1944, Stalin's armies were beginning their occupation by stealth of eastern Europe and Mao Zedong was still building his rebel troops, the Red Army. Today Russia and China, along with most of the developing world, are belatedly adopting the open trade and financial markets that Bretton Woods sought to establish. In 1994, we should not just mark the anniversary of the agreement. As we look around the world and see the extent to which governments frame policies in line with the principles of Bretton Woods, we should examine the Bretton Woods institutions and their role in the contemporary financial world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bretton Woods monetary system of fixed exchange rates was effectively finished in 1971 when President Nixon suspended the US dollar's link to gold. International capital markets have expanded more than the 1944 conference delegates could ever have expected. The contribution of the World Bank to international lending is now marginal, and the distinction between the bank and the IMF has become blurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the immediate years after the end of the war, the IMF policed the fixed exchange rate system, giving short-term loans to countries which found themselves in balance of payments difficulties to enable them to avoid introducing trade restrictions, while the World Bank lent money to finance large public sector investment projects. After the fixed rate exchange system broke up, IMF approval for overall financial policies became more important than its short-term loans. Its clients also changed from industrial to developing nations, particularly in the 1980s, as the fund helped in the resolution of the Latin American debt crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, the World Bank became an adviser to developing nations on structural adjustment, helping them move to more market oriented economies and providing loans to finance the changeover. Today, it could be said that both bodies are in the business of telling countries how to run their economies and providing loan money to sweeten the pill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two most important policies the World Bank and the IMF advocate are control of the money supply and privatisation. This has led to accusations of externally imposed market fundamentalism without a democratic mandate. In the United States, a group is marking the Bretton Woods anniversary with the slogan `Fifty years is long enough'. Policies that are tolerable when applied to relatively wealthy countries can appear devastating for the developing world. So the groups gathered under the `fifty years' banner have called for fairer international trade, an end to structural adjustment programs, reforms to make the IMF and the World Bank more democratic and accountable, and cuts in or cancellation of debts owed by poor countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, a problem with this approach is that it criticises the operations of the free market as much as how the bank and the fund work. It also attributes an enormous amount of power to the twin institutions that simply does not exist. If anything, the two institutions have become less, rather than more, powerful over recent years. Many governments are more concerned with the assessments they will receive from credit rating agencies, such as Moody's or Standard and Poor's, than the IMF. The World Bank's lending program has been dwarfed by the explosion of available private risk capital, and private loans are often cheaper. The growth of Asian economies where nations have become rich from hard work and saving, rather than foreign loans, has also brought about changes in ideas on how development occurs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The world economy has changed out of all recognition since 1944, but it has changed to make it closer than ever before to the global cooperative free market arrangements championed at Bretton Woods. The World Bank and the IMF are showing substantial flexibility in adapting their operations to meet these changing circumstances. The tasks of developing or making the transition from communism to the market economy would be even harder without the technical and financial support that the Bretton Woods institutions have already provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Technology and the collapse of statism have meant that the world's economies are now integrated not merely through trade and goods but by trade in services, finance and production. We now need international economic institutions that can consolidate this achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are entering a period in the international economy where the stakes are high. Market reforms in China are offering new opportunities to a billion people. Almost as many Indians are beginning to benefit from economic opening up. Economic growth and low inflation are finally coming to Latin America. Parts of the former communist world, such as the Czech Republic and Estonia, are showing encouraging growth and want greater integration into the world economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The World Bank and the IMF, along with their long elusive sibling, the World Trade Organisation, the successor to GATT, now have a crucial role to play. They must help the reformers in the old communist states. Failure here would not just mean a reversion to central planning. As we are seeing, it will mean political extremism, civil unrest, capital flight, hyperinflation and even civil war. They will need to help the extremely poor nations. Infrastructure in the already poor nations of Africa is disintegrating to such an extent that even without misrule, disease and civil strife policy makers are finding change beyond their capacity. As Australia well knows, it will be vital to promote an even-handed commitment to open trade for all, despite the dealings of governments in America and Europe and the concessions that other countries demand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the World Bank and the IMF will need to look further than international trade rules and examine the network of international law, covering areas like trade practices, intellectual property, banking supervision and currency convertibility that are such vital parts of global financial system. This has led to discussion over a new exchange rate system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the early 1970s the Committee of Twenty held two years of far-reaching discussion aimed at designing a reformed international monetary system, but when this failed it was decided that the floating rate system would continue indefinitely. Floating rates have been workable but subject to volatility and misalignment. However, the old Bretton Woods rules cannot be resurrected. The mobility of capital has made it difficult to manage exchange rates with narrow bands and occasional jumps in central rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The experience of the European exchange rate mechanism has shown the problems that new exchange rate bands could cause. The currency trouble here has been a real challenge to the rhetoric of the European Community, exposing the unacceptable political reality that economic union is needed before monetary union and that political unity is needed first of all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The European experience suggests that our best hope for a more stable exchange rate system lies in leading industrial countries reducing macro-economic imbalances and pursuing greater policy convergences on inflation and other targets. Of course, all national leaders know better than others what constitutes sound macro-economic management for their country. But there are real doubts that government can set exchange rates and maintain them through central bank intervention if markets are determined to raise or lower them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The solution may lie in the formulation of economically intelligent rules rather than the sorts of arbitrary limits imposed by Maastricht, like international pressure for responsible fiscal policies and far smaller budget deficits.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be able to second the motion moved by the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), and I commend him for his contribution today. I also commend the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) for his thoughtful contribution to this extremely important subject. We are in the year of the 50th anniversary of the Bretton Woods agreement, which established the international financial system that we still know and the two predominant institutions around which the international financial system has been built: the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is certainly appropriate, as is suggested in the motion put forward by the honourable member for Fraser, that we have a bit of a rethink about the international financial institutions and, in particular, that we consider the implications of internationalisation and the accompanying deregulation that has gone on throughout the world in one form or another. It is quite clear, as the honourable member for Sturt indicated, that the world we now face is dramatically different from the world as it was in the 1950s and that the institutions which have been so dominant in international financial affairs since that time maybe have a slightly different role to play these days and perhaps could even be replaced by different institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund were established in an atmosphere of, I would suggest, combined idealism and mutual self-interest amongst the non-communist countries in the world at that time. The basic objectives for the establishment of these institutions were to stabilise the world economy; to assist developing countries with investment&mdash;obviously the realm of the World Bank; to assist countries with balance of payments problems; and, in particular, to try to avoid some of the protectionist excesses which had been characteristic of the 1920s and 1930s; and, in association with that, to try to establish a structure which allowed the world to avoid a repeat of the Great Depression. Looked at in that light, I think it is fair to say that we should accept that both institutions have had a considerable degree of success in terms of the charter that they were first established with. In particular, the avoidance of a repeat of international economic chaos that was associated with the Great Depression and unemployment rates as high as a third in developed countries has to be seen as a significant achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as the motion put forward by the honourable member for Fraser indicates, these achievements have not been without cost and they have not been without errors. Although it is quite clear that the development of an international regulatory structure for the financial system following on from the Bretton Woods agreement has been very important, it has also had some negative side effects, and we need to keep these in mind as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, the World Bank has had something of a predilection for what I would call gigantist projects in the developing world. It has been in love with the huge dam and the huge electricity generating project, when it is becoming increasingly clear that the engine room of growth in the world today is very much with human infrastructure&mdash;with things like education&mdash;rather than with large concrete or bricks and mortar projects like big dams. The failure of the World Bank to devote sufficient resources to things like education in developing countries stands it to debit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally, some of these projects had many unfortunate side effects&mdash;such as the displacement of large numbers of people&mdash;and substantial negative impacts on people in the countries where these projects were being put forward. They were often being developed by authoritarian governments that were simply not responsive to the concerns of people. Similarly, the International Monetary Fund prescriptions for countries in economic trouble have been often rigidly ideological and have involved cuts in social programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the IMF and the World Bank have operated according to a fairly simplistic economic model. One of my favourite stories is of the World Bank in the early 1970s refusing loans to Korea to develop its steel industry because it was deemed not to have a future in steel; in 1987 the same World Bank was describing Korea as the world's most efficient steel producer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can conclude that there has been some improvement in recent years in the World Bank, as the honourable member for Fraser indicated. We now have a radically different international situation&mdash;massively increased currency flows, capital flows; increased economic integration with exports and imports in all countries; the collapse of dictatorships and command economies across the world; far greater volatility; a variety of new economic theories that I think are set to displace some of the traditional neo-classical theories; and GATT.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House is discussing the 50th anniversary of the Bretton Woods Institution and the establishment of the IMF. The honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) has drawn the attention of the House to this fact in his motion, which we are considering today. Over that 50-year period the original intention of the IMF to provide a process for restructuring following the Second World War certainly has changed. There has been a change from initial rejection and lack of interest in the IMF, and a reluctance of a number of countries to deal with it, to a situation where, because of interview processes, visits and consultative processes undertaken by the IMF, it now has considerable in-depth ability to analyse, and it perhaps has a prospect of influencing the economic policies&mdash;political to some degree&mdash;and social policies of a wide range of countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that during this year the financial membership rose from 157 countries to 177. It is very interesting to read the annual report of the IMF and to see its success in evaluating the efforts and success of the organisation. I first of all tend to look at its balance sheet and see how successful it has been in managing its affairs. One would note that a proportion of its loan decisions that it has made have not been well judged. For instance, I draw the attention of the House to IMF members with obligations, as at 30 April last year, overdue by six months or more, by type and duration. For three years or more the top four countries in this category have been Liberia, Somalia, Sudan, and Zaire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would have suspected three years ago that all of those countries were predictably a bad investment. Yet the member for Fraser and his colleague have suggested that there is little social conscience in this process but a harsh rationalist economic attitude. I do not believe that anybody with a harsh rationalist economic approach would lend a cent to some of those countries. If one looks at the loans made in successive years over the last two years&mdash;not just the last three years&mdash;one will see that those countries again are consistently the defaulters in repayments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one has a quick look at the political situation in Liberia and in Somalia, one would say that there has been little resolution of their political problems. It seems to me that an organisation of this type would want to have some assurance that there was a prospect of political settlement before investing members' funds. The regime in Sudan is intolerant of any opposition. It is an absolutely totalitarian process. Yet the IMF continues against sensible advice to invest in the central regime. The situation in Zaire and Zambia is well known to members of this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to draw the attention of the House to these factors. The IMF has endeavoured to establish a regime of good management. Its decisions in many instances have not been good. Its success has been modest. As we look ahead, some of the issues alluded to by the member for Fraser, if the IMF continues, will have to be given attention. The effectiveness, the coverage and the democratic covenants applying to countries to which the IMF makes loans will have to be considered. We cannot always resort to the use of UN peacekeeping corps to solve problems wherever they turn up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to have this central process of providing funds to countries in need, to countries that are being damaged or that are in trauma, then there needs to be a wider agenda than the simple agenda of lending money for a return.

<PARA>Because of the massive numbers of Australians suffering some degree of dementia, there are few of us whose lives have not been touched at least distantly by the tragedy of dementia. Dementia is the loss of cognitive abilities in someone who was previously intellectually able. A dementia sufferer will experience the impairment of functions, including memory, thinking, orientation, comprehension, learning capacity, language and judgment. At the same time, there may be a deterioration in emotional control, social behaviour or motivation. At present, dementia is progressive and irreversible. With the loss of cognitive abilities comes a deterioration in the ability of dementia sufferers to perform the tasks of daily life which the rest of us take for granted. So to varying degrees dementia sufferers must rely on others for help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the responsibility of governments to ensure that no Australian suffering from dementia goes without help. Not simply compassion but economic good sense dictates that we enable as many sufferers as possible to remain in the community rather than be institutionalised. If this is to be achieved, services must be available to assist dementia sufferers and to assist those caring for dementia sufferers. When it is no longer viable for dementia sufferers to remain  in their own homes it is essential that we have appropriate residential facilities available in which these people can be cared for and live with dignity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the surface it appears that the government has the task in hand. At present we are in year one of the government's five-year national action plan for dementia care. At the same time, though, we have a health minister whose recent condemnation of the states and territories for their records on mental illness suggests the deepest commitment on the part of the Commonwealth government to all areas of mental health, of which dementia is just one. Yet, as I have had cause to say in this House before, under the present government nothing is ever as it seems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the level of the government's commitment to the needs of dementia sufferers and their carers is best illustrated by the story of Strathdon Lodge in Victoria. Strathdon Lodge is in the electorate of my colleague the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge). I am sorry that another commitment has prevented him from taking part in today's debate, as I know that his knowledge of the problems I am addressing today is considerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Strathdon Lodge is a facility which caters specifically for the needs of the physically able elderly suffering from dementia whose behavioural deterioration is such that it is no longer possible for them to be either cared for in their own homes or cared for in hostel accommodation. The need for this kind of facility is widely recognised. As Brian Burdekin wrote in his report on human rights and mental illness:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Evidence to the inquiry consistently indicated that people with dementia in institutional care should be separated from people who are not cognitively impaired . . . The behavioural changes that come with dementia can be extremely disruptive to other patients . . . The needs of dementia sufferers themselves are also very different to those of many other elderly people . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Burdekin pointed out that in particular the unsuitability of the nursing home environment for ambulant dementia sufferers can cause the human rights of these individuals to be infringed. Burdekin heard evidence that ambulant dementia patients get `zonked out with medication' or `tied to their chairs' in order to protect both themselves and the rights of other patients. In a purpose designated dementia facility this appalling situation just would not occur. The need for dementia specific facilities becomes even more obvious when one considers that 10 per cent of dementia sufferers are not elderly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, Strathdon Lodge is&mdash;or, more correctly, was&mdash;such a facility. Over the past two years Strathdon Lodge has been negotiating with the government to have its hostel level funding increased. Even though the nursing needs of its dementia patients are relatively low, they need constant attention. The subsidy for hostel beds has proved to be inadequate to cover the costs for this level of care. To date, the Commonwealth has refused to help; in consequence Strathdon Lodge will close. The government's lack of commitment to supporting specialised facilities for dementia sufferers is clear, as the Alzheimer's Association has noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . adequate dementia care for people with dementia and behavioural problems can only take place at present if the facility is running at a loss or is subsidised by some other means to compensate for the inadequacies of the Residential Classification Instrument and the Personal Care Assessment Instrument.</PARA>
<PARA>Having spoken of the need for specialised dementia care facilities, I acknowledge the level of expertise in dealing with dementia sufferers that is being developed in many mainstream residential care facilities. I recently had the pleasure of visiting Resthaven at Malvern in my electorate of Adelaide for the launch of a resource manual for use by carers of dementia sufferers in residential care. This manual has been produced by Resthaven Inc. following a small grant from the department of health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyone who cares to read through the manual will not fail to be impressed by the strategies that it has in place to deal with the special needs of dementia sufferers. I have no doubt that the implementation of this kind of strategy is quite adequate to meet the needs of 60 per cent of nursing home residents who, coincidentally, suffer from dementia and the many hostel residents whose dementia does not take a severe form. Yet the fact remains that, for the physically able whose dementia is relatively severe, specialised dementia care facilities are necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The short-sightedness of the government's resistance to the development of these facilities can be matched only by its neglect of the community care system. As I have said, dementia is a progressive condition. Sufferers of milder forms of dementia are able to continue living independently but only if services are available to help them with the tasks that they can no longer perform. Without this assistance, sufferers of mild dementia are forced into institutions prematurely at great personal cost to themselves and at great economic cost to the government and, therefore, to the country. Fortunately, for many of those who develop more severe dementia there is a close friend or relative and often a spouse who is willing to take on the role of carer. Yet when left to fulfil this role in isolation the carer succumbs to exhaustion. As Brian Burdekin found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The single most significant cause of institutionalisation is family carer breakdown.</PARA>
<PARA>Logically, it is essential that home and community care be adequately resourced to provide the services which will prevent this breakdown from occurring. I am pleased that the government has funded the counselling project for carers. However, the expenditure on this very important form of support is absolutely futile unless these carers can access services which give them occasional respite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs, which recently concluded its inquiry into the home and community care program, I am keenly aware of the fierce competition that currently takes place for scarce resources. While much could be done to better coordinate and deliver existing services, the fact remains that there are not sufficient resources to provide the assistance to dementia sufferers and their carers which are needed if dementia sufferers are to be kept out of institutions. This is a situation that the government must find the courage to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I reiterate what I have repeated time and again in this House: if we are to prevent our health system collapsing under the burden of treating the ill, then it is imperative that we fund research into disease prevention. This is particularly so in the case of an illness that we know will increasingly become more prevalent. Due to the ageing of our population, dementia is such an illness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that, under the national action plan for dementia care, four research training positions were funded by the Commonwealth. However, if there is to be a sustained effort to find ways to prevent and manage dementia, then there must be a comprehensive long-term commitment to funding medical research in general. According to an analysis by Access Economics, in the last budget funding for medical research over the next four years was reduced by nearly $50 million per annum in real terms. Research into dementia will be directly affected by this reduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the government's own reckoning, in just over 10 years time Australia's health care system will be required to cater for the needs of nearly 200,000 dementia sufferers whose dementia will be sufficiently severe that they will require significant levels of care. Unless the government addresses itself to the implications of its own projections, the already inadequate system of community and residential care which currently exists for dementia sufferers will collapse. It is high time that the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr  Lawrence) turned her focus from the mental health practices of the states to her own backyard. At present, social justice does not exist for all dementia sufferers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government recognises that dementia is one of the major health problems facing older people today and that none of us is immune&mdash;not even Ronald Reagan. That is why Australia now has a health system in place that provides older people, including those with dementia, with many options to suit their care needs. As a government, we must be open to new and innovative ways of approaching the question of dementia care. We must invest with intellectual energy, good practice and human compassion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government places a high priority on this investment. There are some 120,000 older Australians with moderate to severe dementia. About half of these people are in residential care; the other half live at home. The majority receive services funded by this government, regardless of where they are living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has reformed the aged care system in a significant way which provides direct benefits to people with dementia and to their carers. We have moved the balance of care away from nursing home care towards support for people living in their own homes or in hostels. We have massively increased hostel funding, emphasising the provision of higher benefits for people with higher care needs, particularly those with dementia. Hostel funding has increased from $59.4 million in 1985-86 to $316 million in 1993-94. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have developed a greater range of care choice for frail aged people, including community aged care packages, home and community care, day care, respite care, hostels and nursing homes. We have established 120 regional aged care assessment services which provide a multi-disciplinary assessment of frail older people seeking help. We have improved standards of care in nursing homes and hostels through the introduction of a standards monitoring program. We have introduced user rights initiatives in nursing homes and hostels, involving residents rights agreements in nursing homes, advocacy services, community visitors and complaints officers. We have improved support for carers through respite care schemes and carer information services and by increasing the domiciliary nursing home benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992-93 the government committed $90 million over four years to a national carers strategy. We provided $9.5 million as part of a 1994-95 federal budget initiative to provide better aged care services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The government recognises the role of carers in enabling people with dementia to live as successfully as possible in the community. There are a number of services in place for carers, including the range of home and community care services, respite care and carer support groups and the provision of information, counselling and carer training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the main sources of information and education about dementia is the Alzheimers associations located in each state and territory and nationally. Their activities include counselling services, carer support groups and the production and distribution of information material. In 1993-94 the government provided over $6 million to support the work of Alzheimers associations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The residential aged care system is well equipped to deal with dementia. About 60 per cent of people living in nursing homes and 47 per cent of hostel residents who need personal care have moderate to severe cognitive or dementia problems. Commonwealth policy recognises a wide range of approaches to the provision of dementia care, including special dementia units. Although a small number of providers operate fully dementia specific facilities, current information indicates that close to one in two hostels has a dementia care program. These programs involve a range of activity programs, individualised supports and different accommodation arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992 the government established the national action plan for dementia care. The plan provides for innovative service provision for people with dementia, counselling services, information services and support for research. The plan will cost $31 million over five years. The aim of the plan is to achieve an integrated and coherent approach to dementia care which addresses the care needs of people with dementia living either in residential care or at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1994 budget provided $12.4 million over four years to  establish special psychogeriatric units within selected age care assessment teams across Australia. This initiative will greatly enhance the assessment of care needs of people with dementia and provide expert advice and hands-on assistance to service agencies. It will also provide top-up funding to ensure that adequate residential care is provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has also commissioned a research project to examine the particular care needs of people with severe dementia and difficult behaviours. This research has been developed in collaboration with the peak industry association Aged Care Australia, and will assist in identifying effective approaches to care. People with dementia are a priority target group under the home and community care program. The national action plan for dementia care is undertaking a range of activities which will strengthen the capacity of the HACC program to meet the needs of people with dementia and their carers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The quality of formal care can be crucial to the quality of life of both the person with dementia and the family and friends caring for them and, in turn, can determine how long care at home can be maintained. A `first alert' pamphlet has been produced, which provides basic information about services. The pamphlet is currently being translated into 18 community languages for the increasing number of ageing people and their carers from a non-English speaking background. A training package has been developed to improve the capacity of community care providers to respond to the needs of people with dementia. Implementation of the training will occur nationally over the next two years. The implementation strategy emphasises its integration into existing training arrangements by the end of 1996 to ensure its ongoing availability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The training package will improve understanding of dementia, the effects of dementia, how best to communicate and aspects of the environment that can influence the behaviour of a person with dementia. Recognition of the importance of this training has been clearly demonstrated by the contributions made during its development by a wide range of people working in the field, including aged care assessment team members, medical practitioners, community nurses, geriatricians, TAFE educators, nurse educators and HACC workers, who, importantly, provide hands-on, in-home assistance. A training package is also being developed for carers of people with dementia to support them in their caring role. People with dementia wish to live as successfully as possible in the community for as long as possible, and their carers support this wish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the research to be undertaken as part of the 1994 psychogeriatric initiative mentioned previously, research is one of the key elements of the national action plan for dementia care. One of the recommendations of the plan was that both the National Health and Medical Research Council and the Research and Development Grants Advisory Committee agree to make dementia a priority over the life of the national action plan for dementia care. Both research areas have agreed with this recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national action plan for dementia care has provided $860,000 for additional research fellowships attached to established research units under the NHMRC. To date, six additional fellowships have been awarded. The clinical category `mental health and neuro sciences' received the largest share of NHMRC funding in 1994, approximately 25 per cent. The same proportion of $30 million in new funding announced for 1995 is in this area. The new research to be supported in 1995 includes research into the causes of dementia and related neuro-degenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease and also research on the causative agent of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the independent inquiry into the use of pituitary derived hormones in Australia and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease was tabled by the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) in the House of Representatives on 28 June 1994. The report makes a number of recommendations relating to research on this disease. The government's response to the findings of the inquiry will be announced by the minister shortly and will include some specific initiatives to encourage Australian research into Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's achievements in the area of dementia care are impressive and will have long lasting and positive effects on sufferers of dementia and their loved ones. There is more work to do in this area. We acknowledge that. It is, after all, this government that has commissioned the developmental and research work that I have referred to here today. However, we should not understate the achievements of the government so far, nor the contribution of the service providers, researchers and families already caring for dementia sufferers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to support the motion moved by the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), although I only have five minutes in which to do it. I congratulate her for putting this matter on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> and before the House of Representatives. It is, to my recollection, the first time that a member has done so and it is certainly overdue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that there is some sort of conspiracy of silence on the subject of mental disability. Whilst there are investigations, reports and consultant reports, in the community at large there is a very grudging debate of the issue of dementia in particular. In my own local newspaper, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gold Coast Bulletin</EMPHASIS>, there is a weekly column written by a psychiatrist who in only last Saturday's edition lamented the fact that Mental Health Day had gone by without a comment from the media&mdash;with not a word to inform the community that it was a day to give some attention to the subject of mental health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can only speculate on the reasons for this. Part of it is, I am sure, a fear that most people have that they themselves will have this fate befall them one day. The idea of the loss of control, and the helplessness of that, is daunting to all of us. Surely one of the other reasons that we have not paid as much attention publicly to mental health&mdash;and dementia in particular&mdash;in the past is that it has traditionally been women's work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is notable that in this debate today there are four women speaking on the subject. When one looks at the gender balance of the House of Representatives, the speakers list seems a little out of kilter. I do acknowledge, of course, that the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) was originally going to second this motion and speak to it, and I am sure he would have done a good job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put down none of my male colleagues, but the care of elderly victims of dementia has been women's work. It has been something that governments have been only too willing to see pushed back into the home, for women to look after either their male partners or their elderly parents. We now know that that is not good enough. We cannot burn out our women, particularly our older women, with this responsibility. The number of sufferers is getting too large for us to be able just to put it onto somebody else. It is now necessary for us to seriously address the issue of public resources that should be devoted to dementia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken many times in this chamber on the subject of care of the aged. It is no secret that I have a very large number of Australia's aged citizens living in my Gold Coast based electorate. There are a number of excellent establishments there that care for the aged. However, even they are getting a little old now. To me, it is notable that the very best institutional care I see of dementia sufferers in my electorate essentially takes place in the newer aged care establishments where there are purpose-built sections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see other establishments trying to cope with the growing percentage of their residents who suffer from dementia and I also see the very real physical constraints on making that possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) referred several times in the course of her speech to the general subject of aged care, and had quite a bit to say about the government's funding of hostels. It is certainly my understanding that a hostel is generally not seen as the appropriate place for dementia patients unless it has a section purpose built for them. It has been accepted that many sufferers of dementia require the sort of intensive care that is more appropriately given&mdash;and funded&mdash;in nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is highly desirable that those elderly people who can no longer live in their own homes for one reason or another who need to live in either a hostel or a nursing home but who are not themselves dementia victims, not be overwhelmed by having to spend their lives surrounded by those who are so afflicted. I am not suggesting that we should shut them away&mdash;on the contrary. Unfortunately, when a dementia section is tacked on to an existing establishment, or an existing section is modified to care for dementia patients, overinstitutionalisation of these patients is the result. The government's own consultants report has shown that $500 million is needed to upgrade nursing homes around the country to bring them up to a reasonable standard to be able to care for the number of sufferers of dementia now in our community. Unfortunately, that money has not been forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I was quite surprised that the member for Macquarie included in her speech the rights of nursing home agreements as a plus for the government in this context. I would not have thought that was appropriate for sufferers of dementia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has recognised that forward looking measures need to be taken not only to support people with dementia and their carers now but also to develop and enhance models which will provide improved care for people with dementia in the future. A national action plan for dementia care is in place and provides $31 million to bring about real change. These funds are being used to undertake research, to improve diagnosis and assessment of dementia, to provide training and education and to support carers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, 47 per cent of residents in Commonwealth funded hostels have a measurable cognitive impairment for dementia related condition. Mild dementia patients are often in the hostel situation and adequately cared for there. Over 40 per cent of hostels provide specific programs for people with dementia, resulting in more structured, varied, stimulating and supportive environments. In contrast, there are only 15 specialist segregated services for people with dementia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of different models of care for people with dementia is one that attracts considerable interest and is difficult to resolve. One initiative is the establishment of pyschogeriatric care units to provide expert diagnosis, assessment, advice and support to nursing homes and hostels on dementia. The units will be staffed by people with expert knowledge, and it is expected that these units will be established in most states by the end of the year. The second component, which is very important, is a research project which has been developed in consultation with Aged Care Australia. The research will clarify the care needs of people with severe dementia and disruptive behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another vital national action plan for dementia care is to expand training opportunities for workers in community care. About half the people with moderate to severe dementia live in the community, with a combination of support from informal carers such as family and friends and formal services provided through HACC funded agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at the needs of people with dementia, there is another group that the government recognises as having special support needs. These are the carers and the families of people with dementia. Between 1989 and 1993, HACC funding for respite services increased $10.1 million. The Commonwealth respite for carers program was established in the 1992-93 budget. Projects include information, training and support for carers; the extension of day care services for the dementia suffers; and the employment of activity coordinators to provide centre based day care for Aboriginal people who suffer from dementia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, then, I am proud to be able to emphasise this government's achievements in the area of dementia as part of our overall program of reforming the aged care system. There is more work to be done in this area; we acknowledge that. It is, after all, this government that has commissioned the developmental and research work that I have referred to here today. However, we should not underestimate the achievements of the government so far, nor should we underestimate the contribution of the service providers, researchers and families already caring for dementia sufferers. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In couple families one or both partners were employed in 90% of families with dependents.</PARA>
<PARA>This leads to the obvious conclusion that in 10 per cent of couple families with children neither partner is in the paid work force. There are significant social consequences for the 700,000 children in families with no salary earner. There is no doubt that there is enormous tension when, say, a 45-year-old man is sacked from his job and stays at home all day with his 17-year-old son who, despite a good education, has no job. These issues, along with the increasing numbers of Australians living in poverty, should be receiving more attention in this place and more attention from the government.</PARA>

This is the same Charlie Lynn who earlier this year said that he would rather be campaigning as an Independent than as an endorsed Liberal. It is the same Liberal candidate who supported the GST. He said that it was a good idea sold poorly at the time. It is the same Charlie Lynn who called one of the suburbs in my electorate a ghetto, running down the quality of life in the south-west of Sydney. It is the same Liberal candidate who said that he knew nothing about education and housing policy but that he did not need to if he was representing the Liberal Party at a by-election. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> even produced an editorial about this Liberal candidate on 21 January headlined `Werriwa voters let down badly'. The article concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So far Mr Lynn has demonstrated only his total unsuitability for endorsement and for election and the party officials who selected him must rue their decision. The people of Werriwa have been ill-served by the Liberal Party machinery. They deserve better.</PARA>

At the same time, it has cut road funding from 62 per cent of the fuel tax down to just 8.4 per cent in the coming financial year.

Dr Nelson is apparently moving to Sydney to live to prepare himself for a career in federal politics. There is only one problem: he has not decided which party to join!

On the other hand, if he believes in privilege, in inequality and that greed is good&mdash;especially for doctors&mdash;he might join the Liberal Party. You only need to look at the Liberal preselection result in Macarthur, as outlined before, or Boothby, in leadership ballots or wherever, to see the sorts of extreme right wing values it stands for.

The National Farmers Federation wants farm assets excluded from the assets tests which are imposed on social security assistance and Austudy. The assets test is designed for urban salaried families who invest in assets that are exempt from the assets test, such as the home and superannuation. The test assumes that other forms of assets are able to produce a reliable, steady source of income or are able to be easily liquidated in times of need. That assumption does not apply to farms or the farm sector, where it is difficult to sell part of a farm's assets in the middle of a drought, particularly the drought that we are going through at the moment, and where such sales reduce the viability of that farm.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. Of course, the House would be aware of the very good news that came through last week in terms of the unemployment rate, which dropped to 9.1 per cent&mdash;down two percentage points in the course of the last 12 months. It is true that we still have a long way to go&mdash;9.1 per cent is unacceptably high&mdash;but, importantly, the trend is very encouraging for continued jobs growth as well as for continued falls in the unemployment rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only that trend that is encouraging from the figures. I am pleased to report to the House that the government is making substantial inroads into the problems of the long-term unemployed. This is the group that we said we would not leave behind in this recovery. I am pleased to advise that today the Australian Bureau of Statistics released statistics that show that the number of long-term unemployed in October fell to 279,000&mdash;the lowest level for 32 months. This is a further fall over the month of 14,000 and it is a fall of 51,000&mdash;a 15 1/2 per cent fall&mdash;over the 12 months to October.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we compare it with the time when this government was re-elected to office 19 months ago, the numbers of long-term unemployed have fallen by 87,000. During the recovery in the 1980s, by way of comparison&mdash;opposition members should just listen to this because it will be important for them to understand&mdash;it took five years and 1.2 million jobs to cut the long-term unemployment by this much. In this recovery we have done it with 404,000 jobs in 19 months. The recovery in the 1980s saw the fall in the long-term unemployed recognised as only seven per cent of the total jobs growth. In this recovery it is 22 per cent of total jobs growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our success in cutting the long-term unemployed is no accident. Today's figures demonstrate that targeted measures by government do work in making sure that those the recovery would otherwise leave behind are not left behind. Among the initiatives that are well under way in helping in this task is the job compact, under which we have achieved 53,000 successful outcomes during the September quarter. In addition to that, 60,000 of the long-term unemployed are undertaking training to get them job ready. Since April, 190,000 unemployed people have entered case management either as long-term unemployed or those at risk of becoming long-term unemployed. We are ensuring that this jobs recovery is a recovery for all. The House should take heart from the very encouraging statistics that we continue to record.</PARA>

I refer the minister to the threatened strike by the TWU, which poses a grave threat to supplies of food, beer, other Christmas fare and family travel during a Christmas period Australians want to enjoy after the ravages of the recession we had to have. Is not this threatened strike due to the Prime Minister deliberately talking up the TWU's 15 per cent wage claim last week and exacerbated by your spineless changes to the Industrial Relations Act, which have placed unions above the law, thus encouraging the very strike which threatens to wreck Christmas? Is it not all also due to your craven pursuit of compulsory unionism within the transport sector?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5T4">Mr BRERETON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a pretty poor poleaxing job. How ironic it is that we get a question today from the opposition&mdash;and the member for Bennelong of all people&mdash;on the subject of wages and the threat of a transport strike. After a decade of unparalleled wage restraint and the lowest level of strike action for 50 years, the lowest since they started keeping records, it is understandable against that background and in this stable environment that there would be some public concern as a result of the publicity that has been given to the claim by the Transport Workers Union. That is made all the more so by the great atmosphere that we have been able to engender in industrial relations through the accord process. The last people who should come in here talking are those people still sitting opposite, the ones who gave us industrial chaos&mdash;that is what you were responsible for&mdash;wage break-outs and the recession of 1982-83. The member for Bennelong, principal amongst their numbers, is flat out counting the numbers now for another leadership spill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Something that more than anything else disturbs the public about the current union sabre rattling is the memory of the conflict and the industrial relations shambles of the Fraser-Howard period. That is a real concern out there amongst the public. In other words, people are realising how much better off they are under the accord then they were when the coalition was in power, until 1983. One thing that does not change, however, and is not ever likely to change is the behaviour of unions around union election time. I would think that the happiest people at this very moment are the officers of the Transport Workers Union, with the coverage that they see being given to this industrial action and the industrial coverage that is given widely in Australia on the eve of their union elections next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That said, the TWU must understand that it is part of the accord process. The accord process commits unions to wages outcomes&mdash;and I stress outcomes, not claims&mdash;consistent with maintaining an inflation rate at or below the level of our trading partners. The Transport Workers Union will undoubtedly go on pursuing its wage claim, but in the end it will be productivity related outcomes that matter&mdash;not wages claims&mdash;outcomes that under our system have to be determined enterprise by enterprise. Under the Industrial Relations Reform Act those outcomes are insulated from the award system. That is a great distinction between the present situation under the reform act and that which existed in the early 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the TWU chooses to use industrial action to pursue its claims that will be a matter of profound regret. Let me make that absolutely clear as far as the government is concerned. Yet again it must be said that the TWU knows that any legal right to strike that it has is conditional upon 72 hours notice and a process that involves bargaining in good faith. It also knows the right to strike can be terminated where damage may be done to the Australian economy or an important part of the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless one is arguing for a return to a centralised wages system&mdash;and I know the member for Bennelong is not arguing for that, although anything is possible of him at the moment after his performance last week&mdash;one must accept that both wages and industrial outcomes now depend a great deal on the actions of employers and the actions of unions. If either a union or an employer chooses to ignore the rules of the new enterprise bargaining regime established under the reform act, there are plenty of punitive measures under that act to ensure that such behaviour does not occur. For the government's part, we will be quite pleased to see them implemented.</PARA>

In order to get the $60 a week maximum child-care rebate somebody would need to be spending at least $220 a week on child care whereas the home child-care allowance paid to carers at home is completely free and clear without any such requirement. That is a thoroughly invalid comparison.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key point is that in looking at these things we have to look at the totality of government assistance to families. If we include payments, subsidies and allowances to families as well as those delivered through student assistance, we are looking at total amounts of around $11.5 billion in the current financial year, projected to rise to about $15 billion in 1997-98 when the new parenting allowance comes into effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great bulk of that assistance goes to low income earners. Around 54 per cent of it goes to families with private earnings below $200 and around 65 per cent goes to families with private earnings below $400. So it is very well targeted. It has horizontal equity elements but it also has very substantial vertical equity elements designed to redress inequalities. As I have pointed out to the House on a number of previous occasions, the real value of that assistance targeted to low income families has increased quite markedly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other key point about this is that targeting low income families has the practical effect of ensuring that most of the assistance goes to single earner households, for the obvious reason that two earner households earn significantly more than single earner households. If we take the additional family payment of around $3.6 billion, which is the key vertical equity instrument, 80 per cent of that goes to single earner households. Most of that again goes to households where the youngest child is between zero and five. That element of the payment system delivers enormous assistance to single earner households.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to make a comparison, my department has produced some figures for me which exemplify the point quite well. Two-earner households constitute 44 per cent of households with dependent children yet they get 12 per cent of total assistance to families. What that means is, if you look at averages, two-earner households receive on average $24 per week in family assistance; single-earner households, by contrast, receive $95 per week in family assistance&mdash;a huge disparity; and sole parents, a group which obviously also includes sole parent pensioners, receive $214 per week. When you look at those sorts of statistics, the sort of rubbish that comes from the opposition about government policy being discriminatory against single-earner households is just demonstrably false and typical of the total lack of any social policy framework from the opposition.

The fact of the matter is that its assumptions are based on an anticipated growth well below that which the government has in its budget figures.

I welcome this opportunity, because some very serious matters were raised on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> last week that led me to write to the chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, General Gration, asking him for advice in respect of the matters raised.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5T4">Mr BRERETON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. I might say that General Gration has written to me today advising that the current board and safety committee members, Mr John Ward and Mr Michael Terrell&mdash;he should not be confused with Mr Alan Terrell, who is the author of the Terrell report&mdash;will investigate the allegations made in the context of the 1993 Terrell report on air safety and report to the board.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These allegations relate to a report that was dealt with by the CAA in March 1993. Of the total nine members of the board in March 1993, only three continue to hold office. I want the House to understand that neither Mr Ward nor Mr Michael Terrell were members of the board when the study group reported to the board back in March 1993. Mr John Ward is the former CEO of Qantas and Mr Michael Terrell is the former Director of Operations at Ansett.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most serious allegation made on the program last Thursday night was that information from the Terrell report was withheld from the Civil Aviation Authority board. Dr James, who was one of the people interviewed, is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They were removed so that the board would be unaware of the exact situation with respect to deteriorating safety standards at that time.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a pretty serious allegation. The House should understand that these allegations do not relate to the Terrell report but to an accompanying board paper. The board was at the time provided with the Terrell report. It is also alleged that annexures to the report were not made available to the board. This morning I was told by General Gration&mdash;although he was not a member of the board at the time, having been appointed to the CAA only in September of last year&mdash;that the annexures were available to the then board on request.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also advised that the report of the study group and its annexures have been public now for more than 12 months&mdash;a lot more than 12 months, actually&mdash;because they were tabled in the Senate way back on 25 May 1993. No-one should get the discovery award today because the then Senator Bishop tabled these very papers in the Senate on 25 May 1993, which was about seven months before I even managed to come on the scene.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, I can inform the House that the Civil Aviation Authority at that time&mdash;that was back in March when the Terrell report was tabled&mdash;commissioned an independent review of the Terrell report recommendations. That review was apparently conducted by Mr Alan Harrison, the Director of Maintenance at Ansett, and Mr John Vincent, the Qantas Head of Line Maintenance Stations. They had access to all of the documents, including all annexures, relating to the Terrell report.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To answer that interjection from the opposition, I go into this detail because these are serious matters. I have committed the government on many occasions in this House to pursue these matters to the nth degree, and we intend to continue to do so. Given that the Terrell report and the Civil Aviation Authority's response are central to the allegations, I believe it appropriate that the matter should also be the subject of some external review, that we should not just wait for the board as reconstituted to consider the report of Mr Terrell and Mr Ward.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that this is separate to the Street judicial inquiry, which already has all of the powers of a royal commission. The government has committed resources of more than $2 million to see the pursuit of that inquiry over the next several months. Whenever allegations have been brought to the attention of the government, we have acted immediately to refer them to the appropriate authorities or to institute appropriate inquiries. That is the case with the judicial review of Seaview and the BASI inquiries&mdash;whether they be to the CAA or to the parliamentary inquiry which I set up at the suggestion of the honourable member. We have always sought to seek what is the most appropriate forum.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs. I recall that initiatives to promote sustainable forestry development in the South Pacific were a focus of the 25th South Pacific Forum in Brisbane last August. Are the recent changes of government in Papua New Guinea and last week in the Solomon Islands likely to affect this important initiative?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3210" SPEAKER="Bilney The Hon G.N." NAMEID="RE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="KINGSTON" MINISTERIAL="DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION & PACIFIC ISLAND AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RE4">Mr BILNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question; it could not have come more appositely than from somebody from Tasmania who has had an interest in the sustainable development of forestry resources, as the member has. The whole question of the management of limited resources in the South Pacific is an important one. That is particularly the case in Melanesia, where there have been unsustainable and rapacious activities by foreign logging operators in search of quick bucks. Those have been deplorable and rightly resented. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the August meeting of the forum in Brisbane, which the honourable member mentioned, forum leaders&mdash;particularly those from Fiji, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Australia&mdash;agreed on a range of initiatives for promoting responsible and sustainable management of regional forest resources. Part of that was the development of a common code of conduct to which all companies that would be operating timber concessions in the area, logging indigenous forests, would be subject. The initiatives also include enhanced monitoring of logging and of timber exports and enhanced regional consultations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia supported a range of bilateral initiatives which supplement those regional initiatives, including, importantly, an offer of a debt for nature swap in respect of the Marovo Lagoon in the Solomon Islands; other technical assistance, including a $5 1/2 million sustainable forestry project in Vanuatu; and, as far as PNG is concerned, a range of technical management assistance to successive PNG governments in that sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Considerable progress has already been made in implementing those forum agreed initiatives. I am pleased to say that the level of regional support for continuing that momentum is strong. In that regard, there was a very significant achievement late in October when there was a meeting in Port Vila in Vanuatu, supported by Australia, which made substantial progress on a set of guiding principles and best management practice for the proposed code of conduct. There is also a commitment to meet again before Christmas at technical level to refine those standards for the code of conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this regard I particularly applaud the actions of Vanuatu Prime Minister Maxime Carlot Korman, who has provided courageous and unequivocal support for sustainable development of the forest resources of Vanuatu, including by banning all exports of round logs and reviewing all existing licences and quotas. I believe he has discussed that most recently in Malaysia. During the meetings I had with Prime Minister Korman in Vanuatu last month, he emphasised to me the vulnerability of small Pacific island countries to unscrupulous foreign logging operators, and he expressed great appreciation for the kind of practical, direct support the Australian government was providing to Vanuatu to manage better its most valuable resource. Likewise, I wholeheartedly endorse the comments of Sir Julius Chan, the new Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, who was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Papua New Guinea Post-Courier</EMPHASIS> on 1 November as saying that the intelligent and responsible use of any nation's resources is the duty of its government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The past Solomon Islands government suspended for the third time the licence of the company involved in logging in the environmentally sensitive Marovo Lagoon area, because of the practices it was following and evidence that it was breaching the conditions of its logging agreement. A new government, as the member points out, led by the former Prime Minister Solomon Mamaloni, was elected last week by the parliament of the Solomon Islands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We look forward to Mr Mamaloni's continuing support for sustainable development that characterised recent Solomon Islands policy. We are heartened by his press comments which drew attention to his efforts to have the Marovo Lagoon listed as a World Heritage area. We stand ready to continue to provide substantial assistance to the new government to meet its development needs in the forestry sector through human physical resources and assistance, and through the development of sustainable forestry industry practices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that it is quite vital that forestry resources in the Solomons and throughout the region bring lasting benefits to the people of the region rather than being subjected to exploitative, short-term, rapacious, destructive practices which all too often benefit offshore countries but do not benefit the people who have to live with the consequences.</PARA>

Does the minister recognise that all of the inquiries he has ordered either are very narrowly focused or will not be reporting back until late next year. Given the minister's failure to express confidence in the CAA last week and again in his answer just a few moments ago, why does the minister refuse to carry out his responsibilities by taking immediate action to restore public confidence in civil aviation safety when any delay in action could mean the further unnecessary loss of lives.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Hume said that all this culminated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> of last week. I do not think that that is the case. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> on Thursday of last week, quite frankly, itself focused very narrowly on a couple of matters in the Civil Aviation Authority&mdash;including one I have revealed to the House today, which was the subject of papers tabled in the Senate by then Senator Bishop as early as May of last year. I do not think any of us should, as the honourable member for Hume does&mdash;and he is a member of this inquiry after all&mdash;jump to the conclusion that what was run on that program proves that there were doctored reports or proves that the Civil Aviation Authority is an unethical organisation.

The best way of guaranteeing that there is no further loss of life is to pursue absolutely with all vigour all of the processes that this government has put in place. When I failed to have confidence in the director of aviation safety inside the Civil Aviation Authority, he was promptly removed from office.

When I have the results of all of these inquiries, when they have been pursued exhaustively, we will all be able to make up our minds about all aspects of the Civil Aviation Authority.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today with two articles about drought in my hand. One is a whole-page article from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> saying that the drought is the worst on record in Queensland and the other is from the Sydney <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Telegraph</EMPHASIS> with a picture, which is familiar to everyone in Australia, of broken bones and barren, twisted land. As a nation we will see our wheat income drop from $3,000 million, which it was two or three years ago, to under $2,000 million this year&mdash;a vast collapse in the income from our sixth major export earning item. Our cattle numbers have dropped from 33 million in the late 1970s to 24 million today. Our sheep numbers have dropped from 174 million to 139 million. In fact, our agricultural production is going down at a dramatic rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the midst of yet another drought, which is to many commentators the worst on record, we again have a situation where absolutely nothing has been done to arrest these problems. If it were to be a major cost and an imposition upon the rest of the Australian public to arrest these problems, then one might say there is some understanding of why we are doing nothing about the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the excellent book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Work for all: full employment in the nineties, </EMPHASIS>the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) and a leading academic, John Quiggin, make the point that the real cost of unemployment in Australia is $20,000 million a year out of a budget of $115,000 million&mdash;it was probably $100,000 million when the book came out. I do not think that figure is exaggerated because it is almost identical to the figure produced by a group of Margaret Thatcher's government backbenchers in Great Britain. It is identical to the figure produced by a group which worked on the Bradfield proposals in Queensland some years ago. This group put the figure at $4,000 million on a budget of $40,000 million. That was with seven per cent unemployment, whereas the comparable figure for unemployment at present is around 16 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I think the real cost of unemployment is such that we cannot afford not to undertake some big capital works projects in Australia. It would be hoped that we would be enlightened enough to ensure that those capital works projects result in the Australian economic cake growing in size rather than diminishing in size and that those projects be of a development nature rather than of a consumption or self-indulgent nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me move to a micro-economic analysis, if you like. If a person on a wage of $500, the average weekly earnings, paid roughly $100 tax, that would leave him with $400. If we add up what a husband, wife and two kids&mdash;the typical Australian family&mdash;get on unemployment benefits and from the housing subsidy, we end up with a figure of around $360 a week. So, clearly, the cost of paying him to work is almost the same as the cost to pay him not to work. Surely it is the height of towering stupidity to be paying one and a half million Australians not to work instead of paying them to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the Great Depression in the United States, the incoming Franklin D. Roosevelt administration decided to pay people to work. During that depression, the United States built the biggest dam in the world on the Colorado River. It also built the huge Tennessee Valley Authority projects, which produce almost as much electricity as we produce in the whole of Australia&mdash;and it is produced free for ever, because it is hydro-electric power. The scheme was undertaken for irrigation and flood mitigation purposes; the hydro-electricity was just a fringe benefit that happened to be picked up on the way. That is one of the most magnificent schemes in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of carrying out those projects was negligible. The USA administration had to pay those people almost the same amount of money to work as it would have had to pay them not to work. In addition, the USA resuscitated, if you like, or rehabilitated 2,000 square miles of the Midwest dust bowl, as it was then referred to, with the planting of trees. The USA did all these great and wonderful things during the Great Depression, a time with high unemployment averaging around 17 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, according to the book by Mr Langmore and Mr Quiggin, the real unemployment rate in Australia today is 16 per cent&mdash;almost what it was in the United States during the Great Depression. Here we are, undertaking not one single, solitary capital works project in this country of any significance to the nation whatsoever. We are paying 1.6 million Australians to sit down on their seats and do absolutely nothing. We are making exactly the same mistakes as were made in the Great Depression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moving on, one of the great problems in the Australian economy is the chronically high current account deficit. Every single month $2,000 million more goes out of our country than comes into it. The only way that we can finance this opprobrious situation is by using very high interest rates to keep money flowing into the country to make up for that deficit. Those high interest rates are imposing crushing burdens on people; in the last seven or eight years, we have seen 750,000 small business families in this country go broke&mdash;and that is not stopping. Queensland's Bradfield scheme and the New South Wales Clarence River diversion could add $6,000 million on our annual earnings, circuit-breaking this destructive reciprocating mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me switch and give the House a quick geography lesson about the northern part of Australia. My remarks apply equally to northern New South Wales and to the northern half of Queensland. On the coast we have what is called the `super wet-belt' where the annual rainfall ranges between 200 and 300 inches. This year at my office in Innisfail it rained every single day for 3 1/2 months. When I was northern development minister, a photograph was taken of me tying up a boat. I had to lean down and tie the boat up to a no-parking zone sign in the main street of Ingham. I was doing that so that I could swim over to a telephone booth to ring Richmond, 200 kilometres away, to find out whether I had to put a drought submission to cabinet on Tuesday of that week. And I had to, Mr Deputy Speaker. I had to put in a submission for an area a mere 200 kilometres away as the crow flies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most wonderful engineer in all of Australian history by a long way would be Dr Bradfield. He built the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the great landmark, if you like, of our greatest city in Australia; the Storey Bridge, the landmark of Brisbane, similarly; the underground railway system in Sydney; and a large proportion of all of the major dams that were built in the state of New South Wales. This wonderful Australian, out of his own money, paid engineers and surveyors to work out the flood flows and heights above sea level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have this huge rainfall&mdash;God has been very good to our country&mdash;of which the vast bulk falls in an area which is 2,000 feet above sea level. Then a mere 200 kilometres away is what is described and marked on the official Sunmap map of Queensland as the best natural soils and grasslands of Australia&mdash;a big flat inland plain that rolls away for 600 kilometres. You can shoot a gun in any direction and you will not hit a tree, a beast or anything. Yet these soils can be farmed for seven years, as they have been in the research projects that have been undertaken there, without the use of fertiliser. The topsoils are between six inches and 30 feet deep throughout all of that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We run virtually no cattle or sheep on these areas because year after year we are ravaged by drought. Officially, our rainfall is 17 inches, but in one year we had nearly 70 inches. Mr Deputy Speaker, what does that do for your average? Most of these areas are empty, bereft. They yield nothing for the planet earth. They most certainly stand as a disgrace to our nation in that we have done nothing about this situation. But these areas are only 800 feet above sea level. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to continue my interrupted grievance of last week on behalf of the vast number of my constituents who list crime in the community as a real concern; who daily read of the crimes perpetrated against ordinary Australians; who are appalled at the very young age of those now being charged with very serious crimes. This fear, these crimes and the involvement of the youngest of our youth are all like the muffled sounds that even an ostrich can hear when danger approaches and his ears fill up with sand. The real noise of crime in our communities would drown out all the debates in this place 10 times over.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week I mentioned the suburb of Rokeby in my electorate, which is situated on Hobart's eastern shore. Rokeby has 1,300 residences. In September of this year, there were 90 burglaries. At this rate, every house in the suburb will have been burgled by the time of the next federal election. Rokeby is a suburb that is so tightly in the grip of crime that front-page news was recently made when the primary school went 26 days without any incident of vandalism. This is like something out of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Drop the Dead Donkey</EMPHASIS>. When I started teaching in Tasmania 30 years ago, it was front-page news when a school was vandalised. Now they will stop the presses if a month goes by when a school is not attacked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In last Saturday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS>, the headlines stated `God and her patrols stop school vandalism'. Even such a small step forward as this is achieved only at the cost of tremendous time, effort and expense, and after events have reached such a crescendo as to become terrifying. Rokeby Primary School's month in the sun could never have occurred without the mobilisation of the whole community after the burning of the community centre, the burning down of the school playground and the nightly patrols which followed which have been staffed by local and parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pay tribute to the efforts of Elaine Deeks, a woman who was described in the front page of the paper as `God'. Mrs Deeks has been an inspiration to her community. She has organised the patrols, arranged for police support and avoided the obvious dangers of vigilante action. She has faced very stiff opposition. Indeed, she has had her life threatened. Yet she stood resolute and has, with the help of her community, saved the school for 400 young children. It is rather a sad reflection of our times and somewhat of an indictment that a modern day Mary Gilmore like Elaine Deeks is not leading her community as a parliamentarian, or in local government, or by working in charitable organisations, or as an advocate for the disadvantaged in this area; rather she is forced to try to hold the line against crime. Issues of substance which affect all levels of government arise out of the experience of these individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is little to admire about the Kennett government in Victoria, especially when it comes to the provision of education health and community services. However, I admit that it has got something right in the area of recent reforms to the restrictive laws surrounding the fingerprinting of juveniles. Without boring honourable members with the details, it should be noted that the Victorian police now have the authority to fingerprint young suspects, those under 15 years, without having to seek permission from a magistrate. As a direct result of the new powers, that police force in Victoria is now solving 300 crimes a month that were otherwise unsolvable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue I want to raise is the insulation of magistrates from community values. I am often asked at Neighbourhood Watch meetings why police and legislators attend these meetings, yet the judiciary sees no cause to conduct anything so vulgar as consultation. I have to answer that I honestly do not know. Magistrates, particularly those operating in place of a jury, must be acquainted with the feelings of ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been high profile public awareness campaigns in recent years, most notably on road safety. I think the time has come for such a campaign on home security. Statistics on the numbers of homes and cars that go unsecured daily are depressing to say the least&mdash;28 per cent of burglaries target unsecured dwellings and vehicles. Similarly, the use of personal names on gates and doorways is inviting trouble and should be discouraged as widely as possible. The cost to the community of this type of crime and the fear that it engenders are so great as to be unquantifiable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Crime affects every one of us. This is not only in relation to our hip pockets&mdash;for example, in rising insurance premiums&mdash;but in our hearts, as the community of which we are part inches slowly but apparently unstoppably towards the law of the jungle rather than the rule of law. It affects all of us. Indeed, I believe there is not a member in this place who, if he or she genuinely examined his or her electorate, would not find in the people they represent sadness, anger, fear and frustration as a result of the crime in their community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are often said to be 10 years behind America in many ways. We must all hope that, as Australia approaches the next century, our cities are not swept by the crime which so plagues the cities of the United States. Not only must we hope; we must work towards this end irrespective of the various levels of government or party political affiliation. Much more urgent than the need to get government off the front page is the need to get crime off the front page of Australia's newspapers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we approach the end of 1994&mdash;it is coming faster than we all reckoned; it will be Christmas before we know it&mdash;I want to remind the House of an event which took place nearly five years ago on 22 December 1989; that is, the unfortunate and tragic Clybucca bus smash in which 35 people lost their lives. It remains to date the most horrific and worst highway smash in Australia's history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to remind the House about that because the need for special funding for the Pacific Highway still exists. An additional $300 million was supplied&mdash;$170 million from the state government and $130 million from the federal government&mdash;when the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) was Minister for Transport. Regrettably, he is no longer Minister for Transport because that funding has gone, as has the black spot funding. I want to take this opportunity to remind the House of the value of black spot funding, which was the most effective use of taxpayers' money on highways that this country has ever seen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it quite clear, and am delighted to be able to say, that the policy of my party and on my side of politics is that black spot funding should be reinstated right around Australia. It is also our policy that the Pacific Highway should receive priority funding because this has been acknowledged by most Australians as a very great need. It is the major artery between Sydney and Brisbane&mdash;in fact it is the major traffic highway of Australia. While the Pacific Highway is not classified as a national highway, it certainly needs either that classification or the special priority funding which it deserves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to make some mention of Remembrance Day, which was celebrated right around Australia last Friday, 11 November. As we all know, the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month has special significance as the time of the armistice of World War I, which was then known as the great war. I want to pay tribute to those RSL sub-branches throughout my electorate and throughout Australia which are continuing to acknowledge the sacrifice made by those who died in World War I. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, I want to pay tribute to the sub-branches of the North Coast District Council of the RSL which arranged a special parade of all of those sub-branches in Coffs Harbour yesterday. In a very heart moving performance, some 500 or 600 veterans marched and participated in a memorial service. To see those men and women marching past&mdash;a great many of them limping, some in wheelchairs&mdash;was a very heart moving experience. I want to say thank you to them on behalf of my community, and indeed the Australian community, for continuing to acknowledge what was an enormous sacrifice. There were people there from the Macleay Valley, the Nambucca Valley, the Bellingen Valley, Coffs Harbour and the Clarence Valley in the electorate of Page. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, in the time that is available to me, I want to make some mention of the drought. I note that the first speaker in this grievance debate, the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), was outspoken, as always, about the state of the drought, particularly in North Queensland which is where his electorate is based. In northern New South Wales the drought is absolutely frightful. While we do not qualify for special assistance, there has to come a time very soon when some action is taken by the federal government to make some provision for assistance. About 93 per cent of New South Wales is declared drought stricken, but 96 per cent of New South Wales farmers will not have the opportunity of receiving any assistance at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the two areas concerned with land boards&mdash;that is, Grafton and Kempsey&mdash;it will take another 10 months of drought before anybody in the Grafton area qualifies for special assistance and another 17 months in Kempsey. This just illustrates how absolutely silly the criteria are for providing assistance. I am not talking purely about social welfare assistance; there are a great many families who are not getting the help they need to put food on the table. This is not an exaggeration&mdash;I am not being dramatic or theatrical about it&mdash;it is fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But even more than that is the number of sheep and cattle that are being lost and the downgrading and the loss of our breeding herd. Even if we were to get drought breaking rains today, it would not solve the problem overnight. It will be years and years before we recover. I do not believe that very many people in this parliament, or throughout Australia, realise just how bad, how far-reaching and how widespread this drought is. People in my electorate are having to buy water to operate their dairies. Their creeks and dams have dried up. Every member in this place should be taking every opportunity to highlight the need for specific government assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I would like to make is that where fuel has been donated by oil companies and others the government should remit and forgo the fuel excise levy. Oil companies such as Shell, Ampol or Caltex provide $8,000 or $2,000 worth of fuel and the government gets half of that just in the fuel excise levy. It is certainly not appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned a moment ago the Remembrance Day commemoration. In line with that, I want to bring to the attention of the House the plight of one of my constituents, Mr Alan Thomson. He is a Vietnam veteran, lives at Coffs Harbour and receives a war pension of $70.50 per fortnight, which is a 30 per cent pension for damage to his ears from overexposure to artillery gunfire. This is basically compensation&mdash;a war pension. But, because it is deemed to be income, his unemployment benefit is reduced accordingly. He made the point in a letter to me that he has often wondered whether the bureaucrats who make these arbitrary decisions `have ever sent a good friend to his death, been shot at, mortared, or any one of a number of things that happened in that country'&mdash;South Vietnam&mdash;`that scar a man for life'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He wants to take out a war service home loan, for which he is allegedly entitled, but he does not own a block of land. At the moment he is living in a caravan which is 25 years old and starting to decay and fall apart. It is 22 feet by eight feet and is certainly showing its age in all ways. It is probably worth about $2,000 if he could sell it. He has, more than once, made an application to take out a war service home loan to purchase a second-hand mobile home or a demountable home. He cannot buy a new one because, even if he were to get the full war service home loan, it would not be enough. He has been told that if he had a block of land on which to put it he could get the loan. But, because he does not, he cannot get it. He is condemned to spending perhaps the rest of his life in a decaying caravan. There is a need for a little more flexibility and sensitivity in the allocation of those home loans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to talk about the need for funding for the science olympiads, particularly for the Australian team. This was brought to my attention by Mr Rodd Snook of Eungai Creek. In 1992 he was the first ever gold medallist at the science olympiad. We won a gold medal in chemistry this year and came second in biology. It is quite important because the 1995 international physics olympiad will be held in Canberra and in 1998 we will host the chemistry olympiad, and we do need funding for this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this grievance debate I wish to address a range of strategic planning and development issues in Werriwa. The city of Campbelltown in my electorate is at a critical stage of its development. For the past 20 years it has experienced rapid population growth, placing its physical and social infrastructure under stress. That growth is now slowing. Campbelltown is maturing, meeting new challenges and opportunities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Campbelltown City Council, to its credit, is developing a strategic plan for the city's future. In a city like Campbelltown a sense of direction is all important. Local government has a key leadership role to play, bringing together all parts of the city&mdash;community, business and state and federal governments&mdash;in support of a coherent and visionary direction for Campbelltown's development. Campbelltown council can fill the gap left by the Macarthur Development Board in urban planning and project facilitation. Its strategic plan can build on the city's many strengths. Let me just deal with three of those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, the city represents an interesting and challenging mix of old and new suburbs. As recently as the early 1970s, Campbelltown was a country town. It still features an old-establishment style community&mdash;the townspeople&mdash;with a strong sense of identity and civic pride but an inward looking focus. The new suburbs of Campbelltown, such as Eaglevale, Raby and St Andrews, are living out the great Australian dream: private home ownership, nurturing young families and forever seeking out new opportunities in education, sport, recreation and the arts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Campbelltown council has developed some of the best playing fields and sporting facilities in the metropolitan area. Our young performing artists are leading the rest of Sydney. At the recent New South Wales school rock eisteddfod, for instance, three of the finalists&mdash;St Pat's, Hurlstone and Sarah Redfern High School&mdash;came from the city of Campbelltown, with Sarah Redfern winning the competition with an outstanding performance based on themes of Aboriginal reconciliation. Young people such as these provide Campbelltown with an immense pool of talent in the arts, sport, academic achievement and, for the years ahead, business and community development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, as a legacy of the Macarthur Development Board, Campbelltown has a well planned and attractive green urban environment: that is, an effective separation of commercial, industrial and residential areas, well planned estates and road networks and the unique attractions of our scenic hills. No other non-coastal urban area in Australia has this kind of appeal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Third, over the next decade Campbelltown&mdash;both for commuters and economic development&mdash;will benefit from a range of transport improvements in and around the city. These include the construction of Sydney's second international airport, an initiative of this government, at Badgerys Creek; the national highway link between the Crossroads and Hornsby, using federal road funding; a rail link between Glenfield and Badgerys Creek; the Glenfield to Ingleburn rail freight loop, now under construction as a result of One Nation; and, hopefully, rail access to Port Kembla through the completion of the Maldon-Dombarton line. The substantial transport improvements in road, rail and access to air and sea ports will enhance the Ingleburn, Minto and Campbelltown industrial estates in the development of existing industries and attraction of new companies. A pattern has emerged in the relocation of industry from older restricted sites in southern and inner Sydney to the growth area opportunities of the south-west. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For 30 years Australian planners and politicians have been talking about a new style of urban development&mdash;the model of well-planned, well-serviced suburbs with a strong correlation between the labour force, those looking for work, and the location of work. Campbelltown now has an opportunity to fulfil this model. In particular, three strategic initiatives are required. In each of them, the federal government has an important strategic role to play. The first initiative is to end the imbalance between employment and population. In 1991 Campbelltown had a labour force of 62,000 but just 25,000 jobs in its local government area. This employment retention rate of 40 per cent produces high commuter travelling times to work, placing further stress on the transport system and all of the air quality indicators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This highlights the importance of the South-West Sydney Regional Development Organisation&mdash;I am pleased to see the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing and Regional Development, the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford), in the chamber&mdash;identifying competitive industry strengths and opportunities, promoting best practice initiatives, overcoming transport and planning bottlenecks, and cooperating with the three tiers of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Emerging industry clusters, such as the plastics group at Minto, hold immense potential for enterprise bargaining, work practice gains and the all-important export penetration. The quality of local leadership will be an important determinant of Campbelltown's economic development. Already several manufacturing companies, such as Pax Australia at Ingleburn, are leading the nation in the development of best practice methods and export growth, turning the government's programs and rhetoric into actual export achievement on the all-important Asian markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An opportunity exists for the federal government to play a strategic role in the services sector in generating employment. The three cities plan in the 1970s envisaged Campbelltown as a regional centre for government departments and offices. In the medium term, strong arguments will emerge for federal departments, such as Taxation and Immigration, to service the Macarthur region from major offices in Campbelltown. Sites have been identified between the Campbelltown CBD and Macarthur Square. I know my colleague the member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland) joins with me in wanting to progress the working group that has been established between this government and Campbelltown council with medium-term planning for the location of government offices and public sector jobs in the Campbelltown local government area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, the city's public housing estates at Glenquarie, Minto, Airds, Claymore and Ambarvale require renewal and rejuvenation. The planning and design mistakes of the 1970s can be overcome through a range of facade improvements, streetscaping and redesign, landscaping, better use of open space and opportunities for infill development. This is a major task of urban renewal covering 5,700 public housing dwellings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My electorate proves how the victims of poor urban design in Australia are more likely to live in suburban public housing estates than visit central business districts. State housing departments have been more interested in rental welfare and collection than capital stock rejuvenation and design issues. Happily, this is now changing. The Defence Housing Authority and a number of better cities pilot projects have established a cost-effective model for state renewal. No federal initiative would more effectively improve the quality of life and urban environment for a disadvantaged social group in Australia than entrenching these arrangements in the performance standards and funding for the 1995 Commonwealth-state housing agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No initiative would more substantially upgrade the quality of life, community spirit and image of Campbelltown. Already significant progress on these plans has been achieved through the skill and cooperation of the New South Wales Housing Department, Campbelltown council and the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe). The state MPs in my electorate, Craig Knowles and Michael Knight, have also been very supportive of this initiative. I understand that it will feature prominently in the ALP's housing policy for the forthcoming New South Wales election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Third, policies must focus on further improvements to the educational and training qualifications of Campbelltown's labour force. Large increases in school retention rates and the work of the University of Western Sydney Macarthur campus have been an inspiration to the city. Additional gains can be realised through the establishment of redistributive mechanisms in federal and state budgets for higher, vocational and school education. The availability of skilled labour is now arguably the single most important determinant of regional competitiveness. Educational agendas can be tuned to regional agendas while also addressing international competitiveness, thus becoming important instruments for economic development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to the development of Campbelltown's strategic plan and the important role this government can play in its implementation. In a city with so much talent and commitment and the emergence of so many opportunities, this kind of strategic thinking and direction will produce enormous results. In the late 1990s and into the next decade, there is the opportunity in Campbelltown to fulfil that model of an advanced urban area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Strategic planning is required to build on the green urban environment, well planned by the Macarthur Development Board, to close the gap between the availability of work and the size of the work force in Campbelltown and to boost those all-important educational skills. I have been a member in the area now for close to 10 months. It is a great opportunity for federal members, such as the member for Macarthur and me, to fulfil that model in the south-west of Sydney and lead the nation in aspects of employment generation, urban environment and educational standards. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the years there have been a number of disturbing cases where the culture of the Public Service has broken down&mdash;where it has acted to protect itself rather than the public interest. I am referring to examples such as the Midford-Paramount and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> cases. The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has addressed some of these long running cases; however, he has proved singularly incapable of dealing with a similar case involving his own department&mdash;the case of Mrs Sylvia Faulkner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Faulkner is now in her 70s and in poor health. In her heyday she was a pioneer; a woman with an interest in not only heavy engineering but also running her own company. Mrs Faulkner invented a heavy lifting device, the Trisal clip, which was recognised as a major innovation with a position in the finals of the first Prince Phillip Awards. In the late 1960s, Mrs Faulkner and her husband, Reg, concentrated on developing the Trisal clip for use by the Australian Army. They had good grounds for believing that the clip would be adopted as standard army equipment and that there was considerable interest from other Allied armies. In the event, the army bought only a few dozen clips and Mrs Faulkner sued for breach of contract. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She claimed that the army's then Engineer-in-Chief, Brigadier Charles Flint, the person negotiating to buy the clip, had demanded to be made head of the Trisal company and that when she refused negotiations came to an abrupt end. Brigadier Flint was later forced to resign from the army in disgrace as a result of an investigation triggered by the complaints of Mr and Mrs Faulkner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Faulkner went bankrupt but her breach of contract case was continued by the government appointed trustee even after her bankruptcy was discharged. But her case did not proceed normally. Delays&mdash;the bulk imposed by the defence department and government solicitors&mdash;deferred the actual trial for 13 years. Postponement is a classic tactic employed by powerful institutions to weaken opponents. For a woman who had been a millionaire, who put her whole inheritance into a brilliant invention and lost it all, 13 years was effectively a lifetime because Sylvia Faulkner's life was destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the time her case came to court, as I said, 13 years later, her mental and physical health had been shattered by alcoholism and other major disorders. On the other side of this dispute were the Department of Defence and the Attorney-General's Department. Not surprisingly, they prevailed when Mrs Faulkner's case finally came to trial in 1987. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, through an FOI request, I uncovered evidence of just how far these departments were prepared to go to shake off Mrs Faulkner and how these departments are still fighting to prevent the truth of this matter coming out. This is some of what the evidence disclosed. In December 1986, some months before the case was heard, the Attorney-General, Lionel Bowen, agreed to offer the Faulkners a $100,000 settlement plus their costs if this offer was accepted within two weeks. But the offer was vetoed by the defence department. So, instead of an offer, Mr Bowen approved a review of the legal funding Sylvia Faulkner received as a bankrupt and which she needed to conduct her case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review was conducted by the Commonwealth Solicitor-General, Dr Gavan Griffith. Dr Griffith was to find out what chance Mrs Faulkner had of winning her case so that he could recommend whether aid should continue. There are a number of concerns about this review, foremost of which is Dr Griffith's obvious conflict of interest. Even then secretary to the Attorney-General's Department, Mr Pat Brazil, in his submission to Mr Bowen of 9 December 1986 outlining options for the case, conceded this conflict. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is fair to assume that there will be criticism if the review is undertaken . . . and that criticism will increase greatly if, as a result of it, financial assistance is terminated. It could be said that the Solicitor-General, who is the main advocate of the first defendant (the Commonwealth), would in effect be deciding the merits of the claim brought against the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA>Another concern was the linking of settlement to a possible withdrawal of financial assistance. Records indicate that Mr Jack Hiatt, the Commonwealth's senior barrister, described this as `akin to blackmail'. A third concern was the advice given to Dr Griffith by the barrister acting for Mrs Faulkner, Mr Greg Woods QC. According to previous advice from Mr Woods, the testimony of overseas witnesses was vital to Mrs Faulkner's case, so funding restrictions meant she could not win. However, in his submission to Dr Griffith on 24 February 1987, Mr Woods changed his mind about the witnesses. He divided the case into two separate sections and declared:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first part of the claim will, in my view undoubtedly succeed with very substantial damages. The second is hazardous and involves certain difficulties of proof.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Woods then claimed that it was only the second part of the case relating to the loss of patent on the Trisal Clip which needed the overseas and interstate witnesses. When Dr Griffith called a meeting with Mrs Faulkner's lawyers in March 1987, all were turned away except Mr Woods. The other lawyers were upset, but they had no say. Subsequently, Dr Griffith concluded that Mrs Faulkner did have reasonable prospects of success but strictly limited her legal funding. She was to be allowed no overseas witnesses and only two interstate witnesses. The hearing would be restricted to 15 days. Every lawyer who had reviewed Mrs Faulkner's case believed she had reasonable prospects of success, yet the Government Solicitor's Office in Sydney, representing the Department of Defence, was adamant that her case was `baseless and without merit' and a `try-on'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the trial, a senior Defence official wrote to the Attorney-General's Department outlining why he believed Mrs Faulkner's claim was absurd. He claimed that Mrs Faulkner would be unable to prove a causal connection between Flint's alleged misrepresentations and any loss, that she would be unable to substantiate that moneys were advanced to the companies in question, that she did not have the proprietary interests in the companies and the patent rights to the Trisal Clips that she claimed, that no marketing opportunities were lost because the clip was unmarketable and that companies could not manufacture them in marketable quantities, and that the credibility of Mr and Mrs Faulkner was questionable. As far as we know without a full transcript of Mrs Faulkner's case, these claims were not raised in court. What we do know from the judgment is that the judge believed none of these claims to be true except the last relating to the Faulkners' credibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth maintained that Brigadier Flint had written certain letters and made certain statements that implied the clip would be purchased but that the letters had really been co-authored by Reg Faulkner in collusion with Brigadier Flint. Flint was Defence's key witness. Defence had tried to disown him, to pin all the blame on him and to make him pay his own costs. After all, he had been drummed out of the army in disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it was forced to change its tune on 26 February 1987 when the Defence Force Ombudsman ruled decisively that Flint was entitled to have his costs paid by the Commonwealth. Indeed, Flint's initial submission to the ombudsman, which recently came into my possession, indicated that the defence department had plenty to worry about. In it, Flint stated that he did tell Trisal&mdash;that is, the Faulkners&mdash;that the army was going to buy the clip and that procedures for its introduction were initiated but that there were unavoidable delays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Brigadier Flint also said that his own dealings with Trisal were on behalf of the Commonwealth. This constitutes significant new evidence. That was Flint's position in 1975, but Flint's financial position was precarious and Defence was threatening his pension. In February 1987, a senior official in the Attorney-General's Department legal services, Mr Peter Swinton, jotted notes of an extraordinary meeting with the Commonwealth's senior barrister, Mr Jack Hiatt QC, at which Mr Hiatt had said that Swinton should contact Defence and say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Flint has run the gamut of departmental proceedings and ought not now to have his pension affected&mdash;if that is the departmental position, let's confirm that and inform Flint. Flint should be required to say he acted without authority.</PARA>
<PARA>The possibility was thus raised that Flint's evidence would be influenced&mdash;that the Commonwealth, through its officials, would hold Flint to ransom. One week later, on 11 February 1987, Mr Swinton spoke with Mr Robert Muecke in the litigation section of the Attorney-General's Department. His file note contains the comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">re Flint proposal: he thought it sounded like we were trying to buy evidence, even if it was the truth. I said where's the ethical problem in buying truth? He said he thought truth will out in cross-examining Flint as adversary in any event.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we have it in writing: the Commonwealth lawyers were planning to buy evidence. But given the distorted view of the facts held by the defence department, which was briefing the lawyers, we must wonder whether truth was bought. The government had also been seeking an indemnity from Flint to protect itself from a cross-claim from Flint if he lost his part of the case in which he was co-defendant. Did Flint give some indemnity and, if so, was his pension used as leverage?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 2 April 1987, a few weeks before the hearing, Pat Brazil wrote to the Attorney-General's Department saying that, depending on the advice from the Commonwealth's lawyers on the prospects of success and the part Flint might play in proceedings, `we may need to look again at the questions of a possible settlement and payment of Flint's costs'. Was it because it was now certain that Flint's evidence would be favourable and that Mrs Faulkner would be unable to call crucial witnesses that the Government Solicitor's, the Attorney-General's and the defence departments decided not to settle?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One feature of this case has been the disappearance of important documents. Most of the transcript of the court case has gone missing from the New South Wales Supreme Court Registry. One official claimed cryptically that the `white cockies' must have got at it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even now, the Attorney-General's Department finds it is hard to part with some documents on its files. The FOI request was lodged at the end of January 1984. The Australian Government Solicitor's Office promised the documents by the end of March. A month after expiry of the processing period, my office appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on the grounds of deemed refusal. On 11 May, the AGS notified its decision on the documents. At a directions hearing on 16 May 1994 it claimed that it had been very generous in its decision on the release of documents. It was nevertheless decided to ask the AAT to rule on the documents remaining in dispute. In August, the AGS forwarded material it considered non-contentious. AGS also gratuitously forwarded the New South Wales court judgment. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Neither do I, but 160 days would be cut out for those purposes&mdash;functions, delegations and vacations. That leaves about 100 days. If we spent 14 hours a day talking to our local constituents, we would be giving one minute and 14 seconds per voter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of us know that there are people we never see and there are others we see a lot of in our general work within the electorate office. So there are a lot of people out there who feel that there is no line for input into government decisions. I commend the people, whatever their political persuasion, for coming up with the suggestion of citizens initiated referenda because it is an attempt to deal with that problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposition I am coming up with is one which does not involve petitions but actually involves citizens who want to make a change in going to a set place over a set period and registering their request for action by a level of government in the way that the citizens initiated referenda would do. I certainly do not see as democratic or legitimate people being asked on street corners to sign petitions, or people going around to houses to have petitions signed. It is too easy to get rid of someone by saying, `Yes, I'll sign it.' That does not work well for good government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look around our electorates at some of the successes people have had in getting small local community groups together. There are not very many of them. For instance, in Queanbeyan there is one particular Neighbourhood Watch group which seems to get 30 to 40 people from that very small local precinct area at every one of its meetings. That is a very high proportion of the people who live in the area. They get together and talk about local security, but this naturally leads to other issues, some of which relate to work being done by levels of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to briefly show how the need for people to feel sovereign, to feel as though they have democratic rights and to feel as though they can have an input to decisions can be incorporated into a proposal, which I have mentioned in two or three motions to this parliament and which have been supported by members in the parliament, to substantially reform local government and to reduce the number of levels of government to two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are people in North Queensland, in Northern Australia, in Central Australia, in north-western Victoria and south-western New South Wales who see themselves as separate from, say, Melbourne and Sydney respectively. There are people in the Australian Capital Territory and south-eastern New South Wales who see themselves as living in one region. It is interesting that the recent proposal by the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe), which has come to him from the state and territory governments, incorporates both the ACT and south-eastern New South Wales into one region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That proposal gives us a foundation upon which we can build so that we can have much more successful and much more answerable local government. I believe that the people in each local area ought to be able to appoint representatives to local town meetings. Small areas of towns and small local villages ought to be able to have precinct meetings and report to local town meetings, and those town meetings should be able to relate to government. I firmly believe that it is well worth considering the proposition of the President of the Australian Local Government Association, Peter Woods, that we ought to have about 80 local council governments. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe we do not have to live with it and that we will not live with it into the next century because people are changing and are getting a bit sick of the system they see now, including the party system. One good way of changing that would be by giving people more local power. The suggestion, in the case of the Commonwealth government, of 31 regions for regional economic development is proving to be very popular in a lot of local areas, particularly those that are interested in taking a regional approach to tourism or a regional approach to building up businesses. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendments put by the coalition in the Main Committee have been fully debated in that committee and I would just like to add one or two comments on aspects of the Australian Postal Corporation Amendment Bill with which the coalition is less than satisfied. The first matter is the issue of the frequency of roadside delivery services. This was referred to by the Industry Commission in its report on the efficiency of the mail, courier and parcel services industries. The commission recommended that, in those areas where roadside delivery is made only once a week, frequency be increased to twice a week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has long been of the view that a twice-weekly service should be available to rural and regional Australians. In the regional communications policy, which we took to the last election, we made a commitment to increase the government's maximum once weekly service to a minimum twice weekly service. Despite the government's hollow boasts in the 1994 edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Rural Book</EMPHASIS> that every effort was being made to provide at least two services a week to those in rural areas, including the most remote areas, this bill shows no evidence of any such efforts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission's recommendation has simply been ignored in the fashion typical of the government's neglect of rural and remote Australia. The coalition has attempted to hold the government to its empty promises through its proposed amendment to clause 8 of the bill and will continue to remind the government of its unfulfilled obligation in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter which has caused concern not only to the coalition but also to post office agents and licensees is clause 17 of the bill, which excludes post office agents and licensees from offering any discounts on Australia Post products. Australia Post itself, through post offices run by the corporation, effectively offers discounts by allowing bulk mail and advertising discounts. Post office agents and licensees are not allowed to offer such discounts to their customers. I have received representations from the Post Office Agents Association protesting this distinction and have been receiving faxes all morning from agents and licensees calling for an end to this distinction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The rationale behind this decision is apparently that it has been claimed by Australia Post that some postal agents and licensees have been selling stamps to customers at discounted prices. However, it has been acknowledged by Australia Post that it is not a large problem. The bill allows the corporation to obtain a Federal Court injunction against an agent or licensee where there is evidence of discounting. Such draconian measures do not seem warranted by what Australia Post and the agents and licensees see as being a minor problem. The major issue which remains unresolved under this bill is the advantage which the corporation will have over the smaller agents and licensees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 26 as it stands allows the minister to dismiss any member of the board of Australia Post. Such a degree of ministerial control over the board and the possibility of interference in, and intimidation of, the board by the minister cannot go unremarked. The coalition has spoken in the strongest possible terms against this provision. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very briefly, I will just make it clear, as the shadow minister for employment, training and family services, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) has pointed out, that this debate was the subject of quite extensive discussion in the Main Committee. There has been a deal of discussion around these issues. I want to make it clear that the government does not accept the amendments proposed by the opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following that debate, a confused position has arisen as to the opposition's view about Australia Post. On the one hand, we are being lectured because we have not more rigorously followed the Industry Commission report on the deregulation of postal services; yet, at the same time, the attempt to prescribe two mail deliveries per week to all areas is still part of the opposition agenda, notwithstanding the fact that the fundamental thrust of the debate was all about deregulation and, essentially, the privatisation of Australia Post services, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We make it clear that we are determined to ensure that the efficiencies of Australia Post are maximised and that the very strong improvement that has been achieved in Australia Post in recent years is continued. Under the arrangements that the bill provides, around 50 per cent of Australia Post's revenue is now being opened up to competition. We think that is a very positive step in ensuring that the efficiency and productivity of Australia Post are continued and advanced. But nothing in the opposition's amendments will add to that cause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, nothing in the opposition's amendments resolve the problem of areas which at the moment do not receive the once a week service. Indeed, the likelihood is that the further marginalisation of aspects of Australia Post's services to remote areas will be curtailed by that approach. For those reasons, and given that the debate in the Main Committee has been quite extensive, the government is opposed to the amendments outlined by the opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendments to clause 12 which the coalition has proposed do not seek to make any radical changes to the existing legislation. The coalition seeks to maintain the status quo with regard to document exchange services. Amendment No. 2 put by the coalition in the Main Committee seeks only to ensure that document exchange services can continue to provide to their customers an end-to-end service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's biggest document exchange service, Ausdoc, has expressed concerns that the bill as it stands will reduce its ability to provide its current level of service. The government's proposed prohibition on carrying documents from one document exchange service to another or on direct delivery to the address of individual members will only serve as an impediment to efficient business practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The definition of `organisation' in clause 12 also gives rise to some concern that current practices will be limited. Government departments and subsidiaries of the same company will not be able to have a private contractor carry their mail from office to office. The definition which the government has proposed is excessively narrow and will mean that many business and community groups will not have a choice as to who may carry their mail from office to office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendment to clause 15 of the bill, which allows Australia Post to negotiate with customers agreed terms and conditions for the supply of a bulk interconnection service, including discounts for mail carried by private operators to designated mail centres, seeks only to ensure that discounts for bulk interconnection services will apply intrastate as well as interstate. As it stands, the bill makes no distinction, but concerns have been raised by the Prices Surveillance Authority that discounts for bulk interconnection will only apply where mail has been transported interstate by private operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is regrettable that the amendments proposed by the coalition and supported by the recommendations of not only the Industry Commission but also the Prices Surveillance Authority, the major mail users of Australia and the Post Office Agents Association have been dismissed by the government to the detriment of consumers of postal services. I take this opportunity to exhort the government to reconsider its stance on these amendments in light of the concerns which have been raised in the Senate and the Main Committee. </PARA>

That response was to abolish it altogether and absorb its activities clearly into the mainstream industrial relations system in Australia. He has not done that. Once again, he is sitting on top of the organ and acting like the monkey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition opposes specialist industrial tribunals. Employers, including the New South Wales Coal Association, have been calling for the coal industry to be brought into the mainstream for 10 years. The Hancock inquiry way back in 1985 called for the Coal Industry Tribunal to be abolished and for that industry to be brought into mainstream industrial relations in Australia. To date it has not happened. This bill will not make it happen. The minister fails miserably to address what has been called for by all sections of the industry, apart from his mates in the United Mineworkers Federation, for in excess of a decade. We will come to the $200,000 worth of reasons for this a little later on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this bill is to provide for a two-stage transfer of the functions of the Coal Industry Tribunal, the CIT, to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the abolition of the CIT following the transfer of all its functions. The bill will also increase the salaries payable to members of parliament, although we know that this is just a change in the description of payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CIT was established by the Commonwealth and New South Wales coal industry acts of 1946. So it is fairly  anachronistic. The CIT, along with the Joint Coal Board, was established to facilitate settlement of disputes in the volatile coal industry and to allow greater government influence in the New South Wales coal industry. It followed a campaign by the mineworkers federation to establish government control of mines. The situation after the war was of a finely balanced supply and demand for coal so that even a minor disruption in the supply of coal had an effect on industry and domestic users of coal. It was also a time of change in the industry with increasing mechanisation and calls for nationalisation of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the need for a separate industrial tribunal for the coal industry has been called into question a number of times during the CIT's existence&mdash;for example, the Hancock committee in its 1985 report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian industrial relations law and systems</EMPHASIS> recommended the CIT's absolute abolition, and the Hancock committee certainly did not fall down on our side of politics; it was supported by the government&mdash;the current proposal to place industrial relations in the coal industry within the mainstream industrial relations system arose from a strike by miners over coal prices in April 1994. In response to the strike and the inability of the CIT to quickly resolve the dispute, the Minister for Industrial Relations announced his intention to abolish the CIT and place the coal industry within the ambit of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The decision was based on the miners' contempt for decisions of the CIT and the hope that miners would show more respect for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. That in itself is probably a little bit of a joke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what the minister had to say in April this year during that strike. He was going to completely abolish the Coal Industry Tribunal because it was not doing its job. He wanted to bring the coal unions and the mining unions into the mainstream industrial relations system in Australia. In an interview that the minister did with Monica Attard, Ms Attard said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government has announced it will abolish the Coal Industry Tribunal, as coal workers across the country strike. Industrial Relations Minister, Laurie Brereton, has criticised the United Mineworkers' Union for continually ignoring the rulings of the tribunal in their protest over discount coal prices to Japanese buyers. Mr Brereton told reporters in Canberra a short time ago, that because of the union's continued contempt of the tribunal, he'll move to bring the coal workers under the auspices of the Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me say today that I believe and the Government believes that the decision of the Mineworkers' Union to take industrial action each time they're dissatisfied with the outcome of coal price negotiations, is a totally unsatisfactory state of affairs. It's doing great damage to this industry, and from the Government's point of view it is totally unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it's high time that, given the contempt that the union has consistently shown for decisions of the Coal Industry Tribunal, that we should bring the coal industry into the mainstream of industrial relations and bring it under the auspices of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, and I'll be taking steps to put that into effect. Are there any questions?</PARA>
<PARA>The reporter said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That tribunal was set up 1949; it's long since outlived its usefulness. Do you think that you will have any trouble in moving it back into the Industrial Relations Commission?</PARA>
<PARA>The minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, let me say, it's been there for a long time and I think it's done a very good job in many respects, but it's equally clear, as a result of the course of action of the Mineworkers' Union over recent months, that the union is not prepared to take any notice of it at all and its orders. And it's against that background that I think it's appropriate that it should be brought within the mainstream of industrial relations in Australia, and that is the Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>There you have it. The minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, I would hope that all Australians would support the idea of an industrial umpire that covers all industry, and I would think that it's entirely reasonable in these circumstances that the commission responsible for almost every area of IR in Australia should have an overview of the coal industry, and that's what I'll be proposing.</PARA>
<PARA>But has that happened? Certainly not. What has happened is that the Coal Industry Tribunal has been brought under the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, but it has its own separate little entity within that organisation. It comes under the umbrella of the Industrial Relations Commission, but it is a little bit autonomous in its own right. That was a fob off to the mineworkers union and Mr Maitland, who has put an enormous amount of pressure on the minister in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is opposed to the moves that the government is making in this regard. We believe that we should be completely abolishing the CIT and that we should not be bringing it under the umbrella of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. It should be done away with completely. If we are going to have an industrial relations mechanism in Australia, it should be for everybody in the workplace. We need one set of rules and one umpire&mdash;not one umpire for one set of people and a different umpire for another set of people. The shadow minister has moved his amendment along those lines. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. I believe that your ruling is correct. We are talking about people who are directly affected by the decision of the minister regarding the Coal Industry Tribunal.

It continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst unions at an administrative level will commit to support for Labor, it was our ability to involve large numbers of rank and file unionists which was the key to success previously. In 1993 the "goods and services tax" was an electoral plus but in 199? Laurie Brereton will be an electoral liability and will alienate large sections of traditional Labor supporters.</PARA>
<PARA>So there you have it, Mr Deputy Speaker. There is the union movement coming out and saying how much it supported this government in its re-election in 1993. Just to add to that, an article appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> about a month ago reporting an interview between a reporter and Mr Maitland of the United Mineworkers Federation. The article states that at a meeting in Collinsville in Queensland:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Maitland reminds the meeting how he personally handed over the union's $200,000 donation to the ALP before the last Federal election . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is what this is all about. At the beginning of last year the minister was going to introduce all sorts of reforms in the industrial relations area of his portfolio concerning enterprise bargaining, voluntary unionism and unfair dismissal. At the beginning of 1994, he made public promises about abolishing the Coal Industry Tribunal, because it was not being taken notice of by the unions. He was going to move the coal industry within the ambit of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. What has happened? He has failed miserably. Why? It is because the ACTU and those people have got to him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the chronology of what has happened this year with this bill. I will start with the development of the bill. On 19 April 1994, Brereton pledged to abolish the Coal Industry Tribunal and to absorb its functions into the industrial relations mainstream under the auspices of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Rocher)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Order! Is the honourable member quoting? If not, he should refer to the minister by his correct title. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SU5">Mr VAILE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I beg your pardon. In July 1994 the minister released weak exposure draft legislation which was obviously drafted with the United Mineworkers Federation in mind. The exposure draft had two stages, each to commence on proclamation. Stage 1 was to introduce a right of appeal to the commission of CIT decisions. Stage 2 integrated the coal industry into the industrial relations mainstream.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In August 1994 the United Mineworkers Federation released a response to the exposure draft legislation. It totally rejected absorption. It specifically rejected all the major facets of the draft. It called for the tribunal to work autonomously within the commission. The response submitted that appeals to the full bench should take place only when precedent had not been set within the CIT. This effectively precluded appeals to the full bench of the commission because the CIT had set so many since its creation in 1946. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In October 1994 the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill (No. 2) was introduced into the House. The bill set out two stages in a similar form to the draft exposure. However, a minimum period of two years was set for stage 1, deferring stage 2 to the next parliament and to the next industrial relations minister. What was stage 2? It was the abolition and the absorption of the CIT into the mainstream industrial relations system in Australia. Also, the minister promised a tripartite body to review the need for abolition during the minimum two-year stage 1 period. This appeared to be a poorly thought out idea to placate the caucus. It was unclear how it would operate and did not appear in the bill. The central council of the united mineworkers gave its president, John Maitland, the power to call an indefinite coal strike if meetings with the minister and the ACTU president failed. Maitland told reporters:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Laurie appears to me to be the type of person that likes to engage in a bit of brinkmanship, and I'm now in a position to engage in the same sort of brinkmanship.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the attitude of Mr John Maitland, the President of the United Mineworkers Federation. On 13 October there was a caucus economic and industrial relations committee meeting followed by a private meeting between the minister, Mr Maitland, Mr Ferguson and caucus committee chairman, the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan). Mr Maitland said that the threat of a national coal strike was on hold pending discussions in the following week. On 17 October Maitland met not with the minister, as promised, but with the minister's advisers. On 18 October the minister told caucus that he was prepared to revisit legislation. The minister met Maitland ahead of Wednesday's meeting with the caucus economic and industrial relations committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 19 October newspapers reported that the minister would amend the bill to implement the union's demands. The Australian Coal Association wrote to the minister, with signatures of 20 leading coal body and company heads, to strongly oppose watering down of the bill. The minister wrote to the Australian Coal Association chairman, calling reports that he has acquiesced to union demands `pure speculation'. Australian Bureau of Statistics figures reported that working days lost in the coal mining industry increased from 69,900 in the 12 months ended July 1993 to 171,700 in the 12 months ended July 1994&mdash;an increase of 146 per cent. On 20 October the Secretary of the Newcastle Trades Hall Council, Mr Peter Barrack, wrote to ALP colleagues calling for the minister's sacking as the industrial relations minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 7 November the bill was introduced, and here we are now debating it. So where has it come from? It has come from the United Mineworkers Federation. It is the same old story. We are seeing the same actions that we saw last year. The minister is not in control of this portfolio. The government is not in control of this portfolio; the ACTU is in control of this portfolio, as was evidenced last year when the Industrial Relations Bill was introduced and finally passed through this parliament at the end of last year just before Christmas. It resembled absolutely nothing like that which was promised by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the then Minister for Industrial Relations at the March 1993 election. It did not even resemble the promises that they made to the people of Australia as to what they were going to do in the area of industrial relations in this term of the parliament, if re-elected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, in this bill we see the union movement playing the organ; the minister is the monkey on top of the organ doing the dance. How many times are we going to see this minister backing down, having his arm twisted by the union movement and having the union movement completely rewriting the industrial relations law to suit the government? We no longer have a system that treats everybody equally. The Labor Party in government has berated the opposition. It has bored the Australian public witless about discrimination on all sorts of fronts. When it comes to industrial relations, it is the greatest perpetrator of discrimination this country has ever seen. People in this country no longer have the right to make the decision as to whether or not they belong to a union. They no longer have the right to say that they want to employ a non-union worker. People cannot do those things as a result of the actions of the Minister for Industrial Relations, overseen by the Prime Minister and the people who have hold of the levers&mdash;the ACTU. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I endorse totally what my colleague the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) said just a few minutes ago. If anyone needed any evidence that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) was unfit to hold office, that evidence is contained in the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 and all of the machinations that have taken place between this government and the union movement along the long and tortuous road to debating this bill in the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill seeks to amend legislation in a number of areas. It claims to bring the coal industry into the mainstream industrial relations system and to allow for the eventual abolition of the Coal Industry Tribunal, and it deals with a couple of other aspects of governmental activity. I intend to concentrate on the question of the Coal Industry Tribunal. The reality is that, given the minister's having made a promise a number of months ago and having reneged from being battered by the union movement, the legislation which we are now debating means that the minister has delivered to the unions two of their central demands. In effect, a new specialist coal panel will be created within the commission, rather than the Coal Industry Tribunal being totally absorbed into the commission. Also, and most seriously, the commission will have to take tribunal decisions into account when dealing with coal matters. In April this year the minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the contempt that the union has consistently shown for decisions of the Coal Industry Tribunal, that we should bring the coal industry into the mainstream of industrial relations and bring it under the auspices of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, and I'll be taking steps to put that into effect.</PARA>

<PARA>The reality is that in April this year the minister promised reform which the opposition would have supported. We have supported for a long time the total abolition of the Coal Industry Tribunal because of its shocking record in this area. The minister and the government obviously sought to adopt our policy. But what has happened? The minister and his mates had a meeting, then another meeting, and we find that he has dragged into the public arena a multiplicity of proposals. He is rolled time and time again by Maitland and union troglodytes. Instead of an umpire that covers all industries&mdash;namely, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission&mdash;the minister now wants to maintain a de facto specialist coal tribunal. He wants special courts for special people. When we look at what the government proposes&mdash;and given the history of Minister Brereton and his mates of making deals&mdash;we find that he wants special deals for special people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Australia have had a gut full of the way this government operates. If we are going to have a system that is seen to be accountable, seen to be open and seen to be fair and doing the job, what is wrong with bringing the coal industry into the area of industrial conciliation and arbitration which exists for almost every other industry in Australia? The minister obviously does not want this to happen&mdash;or if he wanted it to happen then the union bosses did not. It is absolutely disgusting that the minister is dancing to the union's tune. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The union has objected strongly to what the minister and government tried to do. My colleague referred to the letter which Peter Barrack circulated to his ALP colleagues in which he set out in very clear, compelling and obvious ways that the union movement had no confidence in Minister Brereton. We have no confidence either in Minister Brereton. In my view, he is the most utterly incompetent industrial relations minister this country has ever had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the one hand, he promises that the Coal Industry Tribunal will be totally abolished and that the coal industry will be dealt with, as other industries are, in the Industrial Relations Commission but, on the other hand, this bill seeks to implement a provision that the Coal Industry Tribunal be allowed to continue to exist by another name. It is a Clayton's change. The Coal Industry Tribunal is being brought in as a specialist section of the commission and it will continue to have an existence of its own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government might say that, given the shocking record of the Coal Industry Tribunal, while it will exist as a section of the Industrial Relations Commission, new rules will apply; the same rules that apply to the commission in other areas will apply to the Coal Industry Tribunal; and the Coal Industry Tribunal's bad record will be wiped out and we might have some decent decisions in the future. But, no, the government says that the decisions of the Coal Industry Tribunal must in future be used as precedents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some decisions of the Coal Industry Tribunal. In 1983, three pit ponies were still being used in an underground mine. The union objected to proposals to retire the horses. Mr Deputy Speaker, can you believe this? A decision was formally notified in 1986 and the union's position was upheld. The horses were retired only when the union consented in 1989 and after three years of very inconclusive inspections and hearings. I suppose the horses were just about to collapse of old age. That is the kind of decision that the Industrial Relations Commission will have to take into account when dealing with coal industry matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In another classic case a company decided to retrench 140 employees because it had a mine that could not make a profit. The local coal authority interpreted a site agreement to mean that it could not retrench those employees unless less senior employees at a nearby better performing mine were retrenched first. Everyone went out on strike. What happened? Some 280 workers lost their jobs, not 140 workers. That again was endorsed by the Coal Industry Tribunal. Those kinds of crazy, mad and insane arrangements are now to be incorporated by the commission in its deliberations on the coal industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give another example. A dispute arose between a company and two unions over whether crane drivers or tradesmen should operate a small lifting device attached to a maintenance truck. The dispute led to an order by the local coal authority that tradesmen should operate the device when lifting equipment on or off the vehicle, but a crane driver had to be called in if the device was used to hold parts in position while they worked on them. This is absolute certifiable madness. That kind of principle is to be followed by the commission when it deals with coalmining matters in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another widely publicised example given by the New South Wales Coal Association is that in 1993 the United Mineworkers Federation sought enforcement of an alleged industry practice of recruitment only from union retrenchment lists. The union threatened national industrial strife if it could not maintain its closed shop and provide the list of employees available to a mine. The Coal Industry Tribunal found that custom and practice at the mine was recruitment from the retrenchment list&mdash;nothing about the best person for the job&mdash;and that the practice was reasonable and ordered it to continue. Furthermore, the industry suffers from roster arrangements that are inflexible; overmanning and absenteeism remain a serious problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the catastrophic state of affairs over which the Coal Industry Tribunal has presided. These are the reasons why Minister Brereton said earlier this year that the Coal Industry Tribunal had to go. But the government's response is to allow this dinosaur to continue under another name as part of the Industrial Relations Commission. I think that is quite disgusting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has a Minister for Industrial Relations who is totally inept. We have only to look at the minister's history when he was a minister in New South Wales. We all remember the problems with the Sydney Harbour Tunnel and the billions of dollars of New South Wales taxpayers that were lost through special deals that the minister did with some people in New South Wales. We also know what a menace the minister is to air safety in Australia. He goes skiing at Thredbo while planes are falling out of the sky.

The minister marched into the industrial relations arena earlier this year and said that he was going to make a very necessary and required amendment. Yet, after the attacks made on the minister by Maitland from the United Mineworkers Federation and Barrack, we find that again he has changed his story. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Lyne has outlined how the minister has failed to deliver. The minister has in effect been very hard to pin down. Every time he made a public utterance the utterance changed, with the result that we are now debating this bill, which does not bring about a change that is desperately needed. It does not make a reform which is absolutely essential. It entrenches the bad industrial relations practices which have been allowed to grow up in the coal industry over the years into the new tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Coal Industry Tribunal is not being abolished; it is simply being made a part of the Industrial Relations Commission. Further, the Industrial Relations Commission is required to take note, and therefore implement, the precedent decisions by the Coal Industry Tribunal. So this minister stands condemned.

He should be getting in there and demanding that the Coal Industry Tribunal, which has  been responsible for throwing lots of Australian mineworkers onto the job scrap heap, be totally scrapped. He should be concentrating on the social wreckage which is resulting from 11 years of Labor government and which sees one and half million Australians unable to find adequate work and at least 800,000 Australians out of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government and this minister have failed the Australian people yet again. They have not told the truth. They have rolled over in favour of the union movement. What we need are some policies to get people into work. One policy that is very necessary is to get rid of the Coal Industry Tribunal, which has been responsible for so many bad decisions and so much mismanagement in the coal industry and so many ridiculous work practices which have cost jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the minister stands condemned for failing to carry out his promise to get rid of the Coal Industry Tribunal. The minister stands condemned for merely incorporating the Coal Industry Tribunal as part of the Industrial Relations Commission. Furthermore he stands condemned for insisting that the commission take into account and implement precedent decisions by the Coal Industry Tribunal which have been such a monumental disaster and which were the very reason that the minister in April this year said that the Coal Industry Tribunal had to go. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with great delight that I rise to support my colleagues the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) and the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) in this important piece of legislation concerning the potential abolition of the Coal Industry Tribunal. As the member for Fisher so rightly advocates, the Coal Industry Tribunal has been a very difficult and unhelpful industrial tribunal in the administration of the coal industry. This tribunal is the manifestation of the centralised industrial relations system that has been operating in Australia since 1908. As members on this side of the House have indicated time after time, the existence of the tribunal and now its incorporation into the Industrial Relations Commission are a matter of great concern to us, who have been advocating enterprise agreements and the flexibility that flows from such an industrial relations change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this situation it is clear that the coalminers have great and persuasive power over the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton). All the evidence we see before us in the parliament and the negotiations that have gone on indicate the power of Mr Maitland, the leader of the miners union, and the ability to overcome what was originally a sensible suggestion by the minister that the Coal Industry Tribunal should be abolished and that matters within the coal industry should move into the mainstream of industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coal industry, as both sides of the House know, is a very dangerous industry. Lives have been lost historically here in Australia and throughout the Western world as this difficult and arduous activity has taken place underground. The difficulties of gas, of hard manual activity and of ever present danger have encouraged a culture that in the long run has not always been helpful in the industrial relations sector. Let me place on record my understanding that this background has been the case on the waterfront, in the shearing industry and in other industries that I am familiar with. It has produced an attitude both by management and the work force that has not always been helpful in bringing about change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) was quite clear and up-front that he strongly supports the collective union approach, that the union movement should be able to put a point of view across all the mines in Queensland, New South Wales and the Hunter Valley area, which some members have been talking about in this parliament. Obviously, this collectivist view is very much against the philosophy of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), the honourable member for La Trobe and me. Our view is that we should be concentrating on a cooperative culture, in this case between the mineworkers and management in terms of safety, productivity and getting a better result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) quite rightly pointed out in a well-researched speech that the closed shop arrangements working in the coal industry ensured that nobody outside the union membership, union families, would ever get a job in the coalmining towns. That really strikes at the level of opening up the industry to anyone else. Margaret Thatcher had a similar problem in the UK where the closed shop was predominant and only those people close to the mining industry could get a job. The member for Gippsland went on to talk about and incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> details of the very high level of strikes in the coalmining industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong, the shadow minister, drew the House's attention to the fact that the trade union was above the law, that union membership provided special privileges and again brought about the closed shop arrangement. Under this arrangement only those persons who have union membership could be considered under the Coal Industry Tribunal. We are suggesting and have seen in action similar situations at the Alcoa Point Henry aluminium plant. On previous occasions I have told members of this House about the wonderful activity that is going on in that plant. There are enterprise agreements between management and the work force. The work force is working in small groups and they enjoy their work. They have a very close eye on safety, productivity and profitability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a far cry from the whole arrangement of this Coal Industry Tribunal where we have a fundamental tradition. We have management, the employees and this third party, which is interfering between those two groups. As anyone would know, it is really an industrial relations system out of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Jurassic Park</EMPHASIS> because we are moving on from that confrontation situation with the umpire in the middle. The Coal Industry Tribunal is a classic example of this. It goes back to the Chifley days&mdash;and I will mention that in a minute&mdash;when Ben Chifley was under considerable pressure, even as a Labor Prime Minister, to set up some mechanism. He adopted the usual Labor Party attitude that we must negotiate and we must put up what he saw as a fair and neutral umpire. We ended up with the Coal Industry Tribunal, which has survived so many years since its introduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill, as other members have said on this side, is a move to get the coal industry into the mainstream of industrial relations. However, its real effect is to guarantee the continuation of the tribunal as a subcommittee of the Industrial Relations Commission. From the original intention to get rid of it, we now see it as having some special privileges in the Industrial Relations Commission. In April the Minister for Industrial Relations promised to abolish the coal tribunal. That is what he suggested and that is what he put forward, and we agreed with that. Between then and now the minister has gradually backed down. He has moved away because of the pressure of the coalminers and their leader, Mr Maitland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have a situation where the Coal Industry Tribunal effectively stays in position. It has got a new name, a new identity, a new facelift and a new wardrobe. Because it is now in the Industrial Relations Commission, it has got a certain amount of respectability. It becomes a specialist panel of the Industrial Relations Commission and the President of the Coal Industry Tribunal, Mr David Duncan, now becomes a presidential member of the IRC. Quite a remarkable turn of events! From a position of total abolition, it is now incorporated in the industrial relations club. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other interesting thing is that the Industrial Relations Commission is to take into account past decisions of the Coal Industry Tribunal. It has to `take into account'&mdash;let us just be clear about. Whilst the minister has made it clear that the Industrial Relations Commission is not bound by the past decisions, it is, however, to take them into account. It is my understanding that the minister made this very important change between the first reading of the bill and its current stage. Again, the miners union has been working on the minister to make sure that 40 years of tradition of industrial practice will now be incorporated and taken into account in the industrial relations tribunal. The minister should have got rid of the Coal Industry Tribunal. He has been unable to do this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, the Coal Industry Tribunal came into existence in 1946, postwar Australia, when coal supply was very short and when keeping production going was the main concern of the government of the day. Industrial unrest was the norm for those who can remember. Even as a young Australian I can remember the concern that Australians had about the unrest in the coalfields and the current Labor government trying its best to maintain some semblance of normal arrangements between management and the coalminers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Coal Industry Tribunal had a highly adversarial nature. It was trying to stop some of the problems that employees and management got themselves into. The Chifley government, as we well recall, tried to avert strikes, lockouts and lost production. It was really set up in the first instance as a means of settling disputes between the two adversarial opponents&mdash;the workers and the employees. This third party again was drawn up to interfere, arbitrate and try to sort out the problems that quite correctly should have been sorted out between management and their employees at the coalface, so to speak. The Coal Industry Tribunal at that time was charged with the task of `facilitating increased production', whatever that might mean. We all know that it was really related to the industrial relations problem that emerged in these postwar years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a perception that the Coal Industry Tribunal decisions had more to do with a quick return to work than assessing the various disputes on their merits in each case. There was considerable pressure on the national government to make sure that the miners went back to work to ensure the export of coal and the availability of coal for the power stations throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even now the level of industrial disputation is very high in the coal industry. It accounts for less than one half of one per cent of the work force but 12 per cent of the time lost in strikes. That is quite a staggering statistic even in this modern age where a certain amount of sanity has come to the coal industry because of the pressures of overseas prices and some new arrangements in certain mines. There have been three national strikes in the last 14 months. It might even have something to do with the abolition of the Coal Industry Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice the member for Throsby is coming into the House. I am delighted to see that one member of the government is prepared at least to come into the chamber and defend his position. There is no other member of the government here to defend the abolition of the Coal Industry Tribunal. The coal industry, as the member for Throsby would well know, is a very important export industry, exporting about $7 million a year, subject to international competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed in some of the previous comments that the Coal Industry Tribunal has been trying to work on the way in which some of the coal prices have been set. The coal industry is subject to international competition in terms of quality, price and delivery and is not able to withstand the pressure from lack of delivery because of unwarranted strikes. There need to be working arrangements that are productive and competitive from a world perspective. Especially when power needs to be delivered at the domestic level, we need to set in place arrangements within the coal industry that ensure a whole new set of industrial relations attitudes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that award rates are higher for coalminers than for miners and employees in other industries. For all the discussion about danger and productivity, we know that these rates are much higher than the rates paid to other workers. Over the last 10 years the wage premium in the coal industry has risen from 70 per cent of average weekly earnings to 85 per cent. Over the same period the proportion of those working underground has fallen from 70 per cent to around 40 per cent. As the member for Throsby would know, that fall in percentage reflects the movement of a number of personnel from arduous activity in dangerous underground areas to less dangerous and more mechanised activity which is employed in the open-cut method of mining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other differences really demonstrate these differentials between pay rates to workers in the coal industry and those of other workers around Australia. A fitter in the coal industry gets a base rate of $519 per week; a fitter elsewhere gets $425 per week. A clerk in the coal industry gets a base rate of pay of $505 per week; a clerk elsewhere gets $394 per week. Total earnings per week are also much higher in the coal industry: coalminers average $1,237 per week; other miners average $1,026 per week&mdash;and the rest of the economy averages $672 per week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also generous sick leave, annual leave and long service leave entitlements that accrue to people working in the coal industry. This also means that there are rates of pay per hour that show even larger disparities. According to ACL, miners get $44 per effective hour. That is quite a staggering figure when you take into account all the coal industry overheads and add-ons. According to ACL, everyone else in Australia gets an average of $21 an hour. Of course, the important thing is flexibility of earnings. This is very limited because, as is being advocated by the member for Throsby, the mining unions want rates of pay to be the same across the board, even though some mines are more profitable and have different sets of conditions than others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we need in the culture of the coal industry is a shift away from the old style adversarial arrangements to a more cooperative bargaining system where management and employees can get together to solve some of the industry's problems. The total abolition of the Coal Industrial Tribunal would be a very symbolic step; it would show that the government's rhetoric was not only confined to the coal industry but also moving on to other industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several enterprises feel frustration at the government's inactivity on labour market reform&mdash;it gives plenty of lip service to and rhetoric about how it has moved to enterprise bargaining. But, if you look at the details necessary for arrangements to be registered as an enterprise flexibility agreement&mdash;and that is a very interesting set of words, `enterprise flexibility agreement'&mdash;this is what you have to go through to get it in place. Parties must become respondents to the federal award. That is the first thing parties must do&mdash;so they are going back to the old industrial relations club. Secondly, they must notify the union associated with the award. So, even if the plant workers are not associated with the union, they have to let it know what is going on&mdash;and the union, of course, can become party to the deal. What does management around Australia do? It is not taking on enterprise flexibility agreements because of the ham-fisted and very bureaucratic arrangements it must now go through to adopt a policy which has been advocated by me and the member for La Trobe. Finally, of course, the parties must satisfy themselves in these enterprise flexibility agreements, through specific tests, that there is no disadvantage, no discrimination and that they are in the public interest. How can anyone, who wants to make any progress in the whole arena of industrial relations, who finds there is a genuine arrangement between the employees and the employer to get a better set of working conditions, put up with all of that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will spend a couple of moments considering the Woodside offshore petroleum operation in the North West Shelf. I have been there with you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and others, and have talked to management about its enterprise agreements and the way in which it has been able to change the culture of its particular operation. Woodside is a very big project. Some $12 billion has been injected into exporting LNG to Japan and supplying natural gas to the Western Australian market. It is obviously under considerable pressure in terms of supplying the gas on time to its export market and in making sure that the quality and time constraints accord with its contracts over five to 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, over the last couple of years the company has been seeking to improve its productivity and quality control and has sought to come to some arrangement with its 300 to 400 workers at Karratha. It sought an enterprise agreement, which was worth an extra 10 to 15 per cent to the employees, to bring about a reform of work practices and produce more flexible arrangements within the plant and on the offshore platforms so that the whole operation would work more efficiently and effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ACTU, the AWU and the firemen and electrical trades unions opposed this deal; they were dead against it; they did not want to have anyone coming to an arrangement between the workers and management. However, in the end, the unions backed down because, by secret ballot&mdash;and I draw this to the attention of the member for Throsby&mdash;the workers indicated that a margin of 75 per cent of them preferred to be on staff. That group wanted to join staff because they found they could get work which was more satisfactory. They found there were more flexible arrangements to suit families and the way they worked in these very hot conditions and that they could help the company's profitability and thereby keep their jobs. If they retained the old arrangements under strict awards with union interference, a number of them were going to lose their jobs. So that was a situation where a well-known, very responsible company had brought about enterprise agreements, even in the face of considerable pressure not to do so by the trade union movement. The Coal Industrial Tribunal is an example of what should not be done in Australia. In the long term, it will meet its demise in the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He is flexible in that and other areas&mdash;he is the minister for backflips. Unlike all other workers in this country employed under federal awards, workers in the coal industry have enjoyed their own industrial relations arrangements through the 1946 coal industry legislation. If you are a unionist or employer in the coal industry, you have had to work within the specialist area of the Coal Industry Tribunal which has had jurisdiction over industrial disputes in this country. I notice the administration costs in New South Wales alone amount to $1.2 million a year. Though the mechanisms vary from state to state according to whether you have an intrastate or interstate dispute, this position has applied for some period of time, whereas the rest of Australia has had to use the Industrial Relations Commission or, as it is now called, the Industrial Relations Court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coal industry has traditionally been a fairly militant industry, often presided over by fairly dictatorial and belligerent union leaders. Because it is a very high capital cost area, the coal unions have had enormous leverage or muscle which they have used from time to time&mdash;I think often to the detriment of the interests of the country and of the coal industry itself. I do not deny for a moment that workers in the coal industry should be very well rewarded. Indeed, members of my own family and relatives have had a long history of working in the coal industry on the surface and underground and, in particular, in the area of industry safety. The coal industry, I stress, is a very important industry to Australia. It is the biggest export earner we have in this country now by a long margin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the workers in the coal industry and the coal industry as a whole could have done much better without some of the lurks and rorts that have been put in place due, in large part, to the Coal Industry Tribunal. In one of the coalmines, three pit ponies were still being used in the 1980s. It took many years to get rid of them&mdash;a crazy situation. How could something like that exist in a modern era?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From last year to the end of June this year, 171,000 working days were lost in the coal industry. One-half of a per cent of the work force accounted for about 12 per cent of the working days lost in this country, a ratio of 24 to one. It is true that in past years the coal industry has been relatively profitable, and the unions have exploited this point mercilessly. But recently, with a world recession and with a plunge in commodity prices, the chickens have come home to roost in this industry. Energy costs for commodities have fallen in the oil industry, the gas industry and the uranium industry perhaps more so than in the coal industry. Members of the coal industry unions have been running around trying to put the screws on the Japanese for some reason, saying that they have been screwing coal prices in Australia more so than in any other industry. I invite them to look at the fall of energy prices in all those industries. The coal industry has been far from the leader in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has led the world in mining industry technology and inventions over the years. We have led the world in flotation, cabling, drilling and exploration techniques, which has led to efficiencies which have been largely passed on to those industries. In some areas the coal industry has dragged its feet because of the intransigence of the unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Coal Industry Tribunal, in some of its judgments, has been slow to implement the benefits of these discoveries to the detriment of all. In 1985 the Hancock report virtually recommended the abolition of the Coal Industry Tribunal. Now, in 1994, almost a decade later, we have legislation before the parliament to do that. It seems that Minister Brereton, the present minister, has been a disaster in whatever he has touched. We have seen examples of that with ANL, the Civil Aviation Authority, industrial relations, particularly with his unfair dismissals legislation, and now with the shifts in ground in relation to the Coal Industry Tribunal. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In relation to the amendment moved to this bill by the shadow minister for industrial relations, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), the government never ceases to amaze me with the selective manner in which it signs international treaties relating to industrial relations and other matters and then, upon doing so, insists on implementing in a very selective manner only those things in the treaties which suit it. A classic example is the enforcement of compulsory unionism. A clear denial of a basic human right exists within this country today, namely, the right to join a trade union. Opinion polls have predicted that at least 75 to 80 per cent of the population have consistently said that people should have the right if they wish not to join a trade union. But I do not see the government rushing forward with any legislation to implement this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been no suggestion of freedom in the coal industry, where compulsory unionism is the norm. If you are not a member of the trade union, quite frankly you do not get a start. It is as simple as that. At the moment the coal industry is presided over by the United Mineworkers Federation, which has as its umbrella the CFMEU. The United Mineworkers Federation has about 21,000 miners. As the previous speaker, the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur), has said, the average wage is about $1,200 per week. I do not deny them that for a moment, but I would like to see some of the work practices in that area improved. The president of that union is John Maitland, known colloquially as Mario. It is interesting to read some of the things that have been said about this fellow, a colourful character if ever there were one. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> recently said that he was leading a strike in Collinsville, a coalmining town in Queensland which had brought down some security checks on the workers to stop pilfering. Mr Maitland said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When I lived here, they could have got any one of us!</PARA>
<PARA>Others spoke of pilfering as `traditional and part of the company's contribution to the town' when denouncing the recent security clampdown.

This is exactly the legal requirement that applies to every industry. It does not matter what industry it is, there is a panel charged with the responsibility of looking after that industry area under the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. It is not a requirement that people will find in this bill because it is already contained, fully outlined, in section 37 of the Industrial Relations Act 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, in the course of this debate, the opposition has suggested that our proposed amendments will result in the commission being bound by previous decisions of the Coal Industry Tribunal. Let me say for the 99th time&mdash;and let those opposite get it into their heads&mdash;that this is simply untrue. I made this abundantly clear in the second reading speech. If the opposition wants any further enlightenment I am more than happy to provide it during the consideration of the government's amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I can suggest to those opposite is that they give some further consideration to the role of the opposition, because it has not been fulfilled in the course of this debate. It is not a question of coming into the chamber and engaging in time wasting point scoring, nor is it a hopeless search for some non-existent faults in a reform which has tripartite support. No amount of beating around the bush, no amount of obfuscation, no amount of misrepresentation by the opposition can alter the fact that this reform is endorsed by the government, the industry, the employers and the union movement. </PARA>

You cannot pretend that you have absorbed when you pass an act preserving the precedence of the old Coal Industry Tribunal. The fact that you have agreed to this demand of the unions illustrates that you have not really created a single body; you have got a single body which is still going to operate in a hybrid fashion.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The features of that requirement are that the commission is not bound by CIT decisions. Instead, it must have regard for any that are relevant to the particular matter before the commission. But it is not bound by them. Of course, the obligation is subject to the Industrial Relations Act and the opposition has to come to understand that. In other words, in dealing with coal industry matters, the commission will also have to observe any of the other requirements of that act, such as its objects in the various other statutory obligations, such as the public interest obligation under section 90. All these things lie each alongside the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision is a legislative expression of the commission's practice in taking over the jurisdiction of another tribunal. It is the practice that has always been followed by the Industrial Relations Commission in taking over any jurisdiction. It makes great industrial sense as well. It is a self-limiting provision in that, with the passage of time and with changing circumstances in the industry and in the economy, the CIT's decisions will inevitably cease to be relevant. If it was not in here, it would be the practice pursued, and pursued absolutely, by the commission&mdash;the practice always pursued by the commission in taking over a jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have inserted it here because there is now no interim stage as originally proposed. The first stage of the integration process has been curtailed in the amendments to this legislation. In other words, rather than waiting two years to mainstream the CIT, we have it mainstreamed from 1 July next year. These amendments in the House today mean that there will be no intermediate stage. We are there at full integration, at full mainstreaming&mdash;exactly what we committed ourselves to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act will therefore require the commission to take account of relevant CIT decisions as it brings the coal industry into that mainstream framework. That is a very sensible, orderly approach for us to take during this vitally important transitional period. </PARA>

Everyone has said, `This is terrific,' except one bunch. Who is out of step? Talk about being locked into a mind-set! Talk about being unable to help yourselves! The fact is that none of these bodies&mdash;the ACTU, the mining unions, the coal industry employer bodies or the Australian Industrial Relations Commission&mdash;had any difficulty with this provision whatsoever.

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Employee Share Acquisition Schemes</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will give effect to the 1994-95 budget announcement by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) on 10 May 1994 that employee share benefits provided by an employer to an employee in respect of employment will be subject to fringe benefits tax, FBT. Transitional arrangements will apply so that in certain circumstances the existing provisions of the income tax law will continue to apply to shares, or rights to shares, acquired after 10 May 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is making these changes to reduce the exploitation of the existing legislation and to ensure that the tax concessions that are available under the new arrangements are directed at share schemes which encourage employees to own shares in the company by which they are employed or in a holding company of their employer. The measures will significantly increase the taxation benefits available under schemes which encourage investment by employees in their employer company and which are available to all permanent employees on a fair and equitable basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986, FBTAA, so that FBT will be imposed on employee share fringe benefits which arise when an employee, or associate, acquires shares, or rights to shares, for an amount less than the market value. The amount subject to FBT will be reduced by any amount paid by the employee or associate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two concessions are available which can further reduce the taxable value of the benefit where certain criteria are satisfied. These concessions are referred to as the `exemption concession' and the `deferral concession'. The `exemption concession' is available where there are restrictions on the sale or disposal of the shares or rights and where the restrictions exceed a five-year holding period. Where this concession is used, the taxable value of the benefit can be reduced by up to $500. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The `deferral concession' is available where there are restrictions on the sale or disposal of the shares or rights and where the restrictions exceed a five-year holding period but do not extend beyond 10 years. Where this concession is used, the taxable value of the benefit can be reduced by up to $1,500. An amount will be included in the employee's assessable income in the year in which the restrictions on the shares or rights cease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments will allow an employer to claim an income tax deduction for the amount of the exemption or deferral concession. The bill will also amend the capital gains provisions to ensure that the advantage gained by the concessions will not be `clawed back' through those provisions. The nature of these measures is such that a reliable estimate of the revenue impact cannot be provided.

The first change is that the shading-in rules, which currently apply where a company's research and development expenditure is between $20,000 and $50,000, will be eliminated. The full 150 per cent deduction will be allowable for the 1994-95 and later years of income where the total research and development expenditure is more than $20,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second change will extend the concession to expenditure incurred on certain research and development activities undertaken outside Australia. Expenditure incurred on research and development activities conducted outside Australia must be given prior approval by the Industry Research and Development Board. The Industry Research and Development Act 1986 will be amended to give the board power to develop public guidelines specifying the criteria that companies must satisfy for their activities to be approved by the board. Some of those criteria are to be set by these amendments. </PARA>

This change will facilitate the use of syndicate structures for smaller research and development projects, which is expected to benefit small to medium sized companies. </PARA>

Simple rules will allocate the allowable deductions, capital gains and capital losses of a PDF between the two components of taxable income. The measure is estimated to cost the revenue nil in 1994-95, $3 million in 1995-96, $4 million in 1996-97 and $4 million in 1997-98. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill contains amendments to give effect to some changes relating to superannuation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will recoup tax concessions given to superannuation funds that change their status from complying to non-complying and impose tax on funds which change their status from non-resident to resident.

In addition, the bill contains amendments to the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 to restrict complying status to resident superannuation funds and resident approved deposit funds and to specify the circumstances in which a superannuation fund could lose its complying status.

In particular, the bill contains measures to specify the exceptional circumstances in which a superannuation fund will become a non-complying fund.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the bill excludes from fringe benefits tax employer contributions paid to a non-resident superannuation fund for the benefit of expatriate employees who are in Australia temporarily for a period of up to four years.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 9 September 1994, the Treasurer announced retrospective amendments to the income tax law relating to the tax treatment of surpluses repatriated to an employer from a superannuation fund. The amendments ensure that any payment or benefit from a superannuation fund, other than a payment or benefit to a member, is included in the assessable income of the recipient. The purpose of the amendments is to overcome arrangements entered into by taxpayers whereby the surplus from an employer sponsored superannuation fund is repatriated to the sponsoring employer, or an associate of the sponsoring employer, in a way which avoids the payment of tax on receipt of the surplus. Those arrangements are in breach of the clear thrust of the existing law and represent a serious threat to the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To allow surpluses to be repatriated tax free would also give an undeserved benefit to employers at the expense of the taxpayer community in general.

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Children's Income</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The income tax law generally taxes certain income of minors at a higher rate to prevent taxpayers diverting their income to children for the purposes of avoiding their proper tax responsibilities. In recognition that not all unearned income of minors should be taxed at a higher rate, the law was intended to relieve from taxation at the higher rate income derived by a minor from the investment of property transferred to the minor as part of a legal settlement in connection with a family breakdown. However, the law did not achieve this because the words used in the relevant relief provisions are inconsistent with the Family Law Act 1975. Amendments in the bill will ensure that the parliament's original intention to provide relief is fulfilled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other amendments will clarify the anti-avoidance provisions relating to a minor's unearned income. Specifically, the amendments will continue to limit the relief from the higher tax rate to ensure that the amount qualifying for relief is no more than an arm's length rate of return on the property transferred. The amendment of the anti-avoidance provisions will prevent a potential loss to the revenue of around $6 million per year. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the existing income tax law, successful cash bids for the granting of offshore petroleum titles are deductible over 10 years or the life of the petroleum field, whichever is the lesser. The bill proposes to extend this deduction to successful cash bids for onshore and overseas petroleum titles and to onshore, offshore and overseas mineral titles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures are consistent with the government's general approach to taxation policy, which is to enhance equity between taxpayers and remove obstacles to worthwhile investment. The bill will ensure that Australian explorers and miners operating overseas are not disadvantaged, whether they operate onshore, offshore or overseas in making cash bids; all successful bids will have the same Australian tax treatment, and so no area of bidding will be comparatively advantaged or disadvantaged.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of the amendments to the revenue will be less than $1 million per annum. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Income Tax (Deficit Deferral) Bill 1994 will impose deficit deferral on companies in certain circumstances to ensure that the tax is paid.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Charles,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RE: VIETNAM VETERANS EXPOSURE TO TOXIC CHEMICALS:</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would be pleased if you will table the following letter in Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>I intend to read Mr Ashmore's letter into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recent revelations by Professors MacLennan and Smith, and acceptance by the Australian Government, of a clear link between a range of cancers and exposure to herbicides whilst on service in Vietnam, is welcomed. These latest findings are what Veterans have always suspected and this belated confirmation will be helpful to them and their families.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has taken fifteen years for Vietnam Veterans to have their strong suspicions of the increased incidence of cancers confirmed. They have been equally concerned and vocal over the same period about the high incidence of birth defects amongst their children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also suspected amongst the same veterans that exposure to herbicides whilst on active service may be responsible for cancers in their children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My now 12 year old Son was diagnosed with Leukaemia almost ten years ago. He suffered two relapses but was fortunate his young sister had compatible bone marrow. A transplant took place in 1989. My Son is now cured of his cancer but now has a chemotherapy induced heart condition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After the admission last month, which clearly showed that a Senate Committee and the Evatt Royal Commission were in error to proclaim Agent Orange not guilty, my Son is asking questions like, "Did this cause my leukaemia?". I am sure that disabled children of Vietnam Veterans are echoing the same type of question. It's a question their parents are unable to answer with authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fifteen years ago Veterans observed a high suicide rate in fellow Veterans and high rates of cancer and birth defects in their children. It has taken fifteen years to have been proved correct. How much longer is it going to take before our children, whether they have birth defects or cancer, are told the truth?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As successive Governments have had fifteen years to investigate claims of birth defects and increased incidence of cancer in veterans children, I ask the government:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In light of the overturning of the findings of a Senate Committee and a Royal Commission will the government now commission rigorous independent investigations to determine if Veterans strong suspicions in these areas will again be confirmed?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe the least the government can do is to provide our children with concrete answers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours faithfully,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Alan Ashmore.</PARA>
<PARA>Alan Ashmore is a thoughtful man. He is a man of the highest integrity who deserves to have his question answered. I know Alan well, as he is the driving force behind an organisation dedicated to serve young people in my electorate. This organisation is known as ECHO, the Emerald Club for Hope and Outreach. Every week hundreds of young people come together to learn how to be leaders in the community and how to respect Christian moral values. They are given activities which help them to interact with each other, to not get into trouble, to not resort to graffiti, to not go out on the streets and to not resort to drugs and alcohol. This youth group has been one of the most effective that I have seen anywhere in the world. Alan Ashmore is the man who created it. He is indeed a well-respected member of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of Alan's letter is that I am certain it was sent in all sincerity. He asks us in this place who represent him, the people of my electorate of La Trobe and indeed the people throughout the nation to consider most carefully this most important question of birth defects and cancer in the children of Vietnam veterans. I do not know the right or the wrong of the issue, but I do believe that veterans and their wives and offspring deserve honest and careful evaluation of their suspicions. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5V5">Mr STEPHEN SMITH</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Perth)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (7.32 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I wish to draw attention to an important banking and finance issue in my state of Western Australia. I do so in my capacity as a Western Australian; as the federal member for Perth, in which most of the administrative headquarters of Western Australian financial institutions are based; and also as an interested member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration, which Mr Speaker has chaired well in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue has been the subject of public comment in recent days in Western Australia. It requires careful consideration and serious analysis. I refer to the proposed privatisation of Bankwest, which is the state owned Rural and Industries Bank which has recently been renamed, and the possible merger with Challenge Bank, which is a private bank not in public ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subject to a couple of points in respect of ensuring the headquarters remain in Western Australia and attention to involuntary staff reductions, I think the privatisation of Bankwest is a good thing and good policy. I also think that the merger with Challenge is a good thing and good policy. I hope the Western Australian state government agrees to it. Why I think that merger is a good thing is summarised in one essential point: it would leave Western Australia with one strong regional bank, which would be good for the state and good for the inhabitants of Western Australia. Some members might be aware, particularly those from Western Australia, that in recent days Challenge Bank has announced what I describe as its $100 million-plus offer by way of merger; that is, whatever is proposed to be raised by the privatisation of Bankwest, Challenge argues that with a merger it can raise finance by $100 million more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased to hear the Premier of Western Australia saying that he would not be rushed or bulldozed into a decision on this matter. I think that is right. This is a serious policy issue for the state which requires serious consideration and which needs to be looked at carefully. While on the surface the Challenge offer or proposal seems to be an attractive option, there may well be other issues which go to the benefit of the state, which have not yet been the subject of public comment and which the government of Western Australia is currently considering. The argument that the Challenge offer is worthy of consideration is best summarised in a couple of articles in newspapers of Friday, 11 November. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, under the heading `Challenge's BankWest offer hard to reject', Stephen Bartholomeusz says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Challenge proposal ought, however, to be irresistable because it . . . would produce a substantially higher return to the Government than any other option.</PARA>
<PARA>Towards the end of the article, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only concerns for state government vendors ought to be price and residual risk. On both counts . . . a merger looks better than a simple float.</PARA>
<PARA>In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of the same date, Ivor Ries says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case for merging Challenge Bank and BankWest is compelling. It has been estimated that the merger would boost the profits attributable to the organisation by around $40 million.</PARA>
<PARA>That explains the nature of the offer and why this issue is obviously deserving of serious consideration. It would be good policy and good for Western Australia for the merger to proceed because, as I have said, it would leave Western Australia with a strong regional bank. It is acknowledged on all sides that there are, as described in the trade, substantial synergies between the two banks; that is, they would be a good fit and a good mix. It would minimise the risk of losses in any market share that might occur from the privatisation. Western Australia would have one regional bank, rather than two competing out of a limited pool. It would be more secure from possible takeover threat from the eastern states. But the key compelling point is that it would provide Western Australia with a strong regional bank with better international access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer again to the article by Stephen Bartholomeusz in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The merger of two WA banks would produce substantial synergies but would minimise the risk of market share losses that normally occur in bank mergers . . . It would create a $12 billion bank&mdash;about three times the size of Challenge&mdash;and would ensure that there weren't two WA institutions of modest size competing for the limited pool of funding and assets available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would have about one-third of the WA market . . . would probably be more secure from takeover than either of the individual banks, given the presence of the other.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both banks are supported by the capital markets and a larger, more efficient and more profitable bank could only expect to gain better support and better access to international markets.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the key point, particularly in respect of those Asian countries on the same time line as Perth. Similar sentiments are expressed in an article by Bryan Frith in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 11 November entitled `Banks' merger would be a beautiful fit.' <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 1 November the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) announced a $183 million package aimed at reducing the impact of aircraft noise on residents living around Sydney airport. The package was largely based on the July 1994 draft noise management plan by consultants Mitchell McCotter. However, at the last moment the government extended its offer of insulation to public buildings, such as schools and hospitals, in inner Sydney that the consultants did not originally consider were in a noisy enough area to warrant expenditure on soundproofing. This added a further $8.4 million to the original $175 million cost. On 1 November the minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The implications of this decision for other similarly affected airports are being examined.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet the Public Affairs Director of the Federal Airports Corporation, Mr Peter Arnold, was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> of 11 November, after I raised the matter of equal treatment for Moorabbin airport area public buildings, as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There were no plans to extend the federal government's noise compensation. If that were to happen, other airports would be higher up the list than Moorabbin.</PARA>
<PARA>Why the apparent contradiction between the minister's statement and that of a key government authority? My office has had many complaints about aircraft noise in and around the Moorabbin airport area over the past few years. The Federal Airports Corporation admits that the number of complaints it has received so far this year is slightly up compared with 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sydney consultants say that, at forecast noise levels of 25 to 30 on the scale used, between 20 and 30 per cent of people will be seriously affected by noise and another 40 per cent moderately affected. Yet this government&mdash;and I stress that this is not the fault of the FAC&mdash;now refuses to give similar offers of insulation to public buildings such as Parkdale Secondary College in Isaacs, whose 700-strong community is subjected daily to between 25 and 30 Australian noise exposure index contours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Mitchell McCotter report made it clear that an actual reading of 25 to 30 for a school was unacceptable. The table drawn up by the consultants referred to Australian noise exposure forecasts rather than actual readings. So in inner Sydney, a number of schools will be insulated, when the amount of noise they are assessed as suffering is only a forecast based on projections to the year 2010&mdash;16 years away&mdash;when Sydney airport may be at full capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pandering to Sydneysiders while ignoring the same difficulties faced by residents around Moorabbin, Adelaide and other airports is most unfair. Surely, if you are a student at Parkdale and you take almost a year to get accustomed to the noise of aircraft movements, you should have the same expectations as a Sydney school student that your school will have the same acoustic treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My constituents have other reasons to be unhappy with the government. The new 650 stall market at Moorabbin airport was opened recently without a planning permit. My constituents are also being denied the opportunity for lower domestic air fares that the entry of Air New Zealand might bring. But, most of all, residents near Moorabbin airport want a fair go and insulation for one of the worst affected public buildings&mdash;Parkdale Secondary College. That would be most welcome. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I made my maiden speech in this House 20 months ago, I mentioned that child care in parliament was a very important issue. I am happy to say that there has been some progress on this matter. I think the House would benefit from knowing what steps have been taken, Mr Speaker, especially in regard to your role and that of the Joint House Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many members of parliament have young children, and when they come to Canberra to visit it is essential that they have somewhere where they can spend their time without disrupting the member's office. My good friend and colleague the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) has a daughter who has just turned one and a son who has turned three, and he tells me that he is very pleased that we have now made some progress in this field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are usually only one or two weeks of the year when school aged children such as my own are able to join us here during the school holidays. Perhaps for those in the Senate, there would be even more of these dates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although there is a need for child-care facilities for staff and departmental members, due to parliamentary sitting patterns such facilities are probably not exactly what we require as members of parliament. So it was necessary to take a two-pronged approach. Arising out of discussions with your good self, Mr Speaker, there was the idea that in the International Year of the Family it would be appropriate to rename the Spouses Lounge the Family Lounge and make this a family friendly parliament. I am pleased to say that this idea has been taken up. Also, I think we should thank the Parliamentary Partners who, when they were approached on this suggestion, agreed to it and have been very cooperative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 21 November work will commence in-house to make some adjustments to the room which was previously the Spouses Lounge&mdash;and which now, I am pleased to say, has the name `Family Lounge' on it&mdash;to make it child safe. This will require some small changes, such as removing part of the carpeted area, taking out the hot water system, relocating a nappy disposal unit and also supplying a nappy changing table for babies, and putting in some low tables for children to play on. Also, parliamentarians will be able to donate suitable videos, games, books and other activities material for their children to use in this room. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Joint House Department for a very sensible initiative in relocating existing resources that everyone may benefit from, especially as members are required to visit their children but still be in four-minute call of the chamber when they are needed for their work. Either the member's spouse or his or her nominee can supervise the children in the Family Lounge. Of course, older children will not require supervision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the other issue, which is that of child care for staff, members should be aware that a child-care centre is located in the new Foreign Affairs and Trade building which will be open in 1996. Some places have been earmarked for people working in the parliament to have access to that centre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of work has been done by the Joint House Department in liaising with private child-care facilities to provide a child-care facility within the Parliamentary Triangle. To this effect, in February a survey will be conducted of all employees in the parliament asking them for details. We must remember that there are five departments at work in Parliament House, as well as journalists and the staff of members. Of course, during sitting times the number of people working in the parliament can swell up to 4,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This survey has been particularly adapted for those people who require child-care facilities. It is not a classic case of asking, `Do you require child-care, and if so what?' It is going to be looking at the special needs of the parliament&mdash;the hours required, broken placements, occasional care, holiday activities, et cetera. This survey has been devised in conjunction with work and child-care services, so it will, hopefully, be able to answer a number of the requirements that staff members have. It is hoped that a private child-care centre will be built within the Parliamentary Triangle that will meet the specific needs that come out of this survey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I make the comment that Jill Baker from the Joint House Department, who has overseen a lot of the detail of this project, has demonstrated a mother's touch that has been evident in a lot of the things that have been brought in. There are some splendid ideas which do not involve any cost in terms of taxpayers' money, just some good commonsense which I am sure all members will benefit from. Hopefully, the staff will be able to have their needs met as well. The entire department needs to be thanked. We must also resolve that this is not just a women's issue; it is a people's issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to talk about one of the most exciting inventions this country has ever seen and to tell how the present government has bungled the assistance that was due to helping this discovery come to commercial fruition. I refer to a small company based in Sydney, Intec Copper Pty Ltd, which has continued the great Australian tradition of pioneering mining inventions by discovering a chemical process to economically separate copper from copper sulfide ore.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the present method, you put this ore into a large smelter at a high temperature and out the other end you get copper but, unfortunately, you also get hundreds of thousands of tonnes of sulfur dioxide, which eventually becomes acid rain and which has been banned in other countries. If you trap this sulfur dioxide, you end up with sulfuric acid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To smelt copper in this way requires an enormous capital cost in smelters, usually running into hundreds of millions of dollars. The smelters are very large to get economies of scale. They are costly to run. The one at Port Kembla has been running at a loss for some years. An announcement was made the other day that because of the modifications that have to be made for environmental and other reasons, it may close down next year, with the loss of 440 jobs. Of course, the copper that is processed there would have to go overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Intec has a chemical chloride leaching process which produces very high quality copper&mdash;it is 99.99 per cent copper&mdash;and elemental sulfur, which can be used for such things as fertilisers. It can also extract gold and other impurities such as bismuth, arsenic and antimony. It can treat lower grade ores than can a smelter; therefore, present sub-economic ore bodies could be utilised. It can treat very complex ores, because the valance on the copper ion is only one plus instead of two pluses. It uses only half the energy. It operates at a very low temperature compared with a smelter&mdash;only 85 degrees. Environmental pollution is cut to zero; no sulfur dioxide is produced, only elemental sulfur. It is less costly to run and it can be run on a scale of any size, so you can use it on-site for small deposits. It cuts the freight costs of sending the ore to places like Mount Isa, Port Kembla or wherever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Worldwide, 100 patents have been taken out on this. I think that it absolutely oozes potential in royalties. Later it could be used for other ore such as lead, zinc and nickel. It sounds almost too good to be true. The world has been searching for a successful chloride leaching process for over 200 years and this small company in Sydney has finally cracked it. Within a short period of time, the partners in this company are going to put a $10 million plant into Port Kembla to test it there. By early 1996, at the latest, they hope to put a $75 million plant into north Parkes which could also treat the ore from Cobar at Girilambone and Cadia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many companies are already interested in this&mdash;16 companies have already bought in. In fact, Intec is beating them off. They include Australian companies such as BHP Minerals, North Broken Hill Peko and Western Mining; overseas companies such as RTZ, the largest mining house in the world; and Japanese companies such as Sumitomo, Nippon and Mitsui. But, every time an overseas company comes in, it dilutes the Australian equity. Intec would benefit greatly if it could get a government grant&mdash;as I believe it is entitled to&mdash;to further advance what it is researching. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The IR&amp;D board has five committees. The EIE committee&mdash;the engineering, infrastructure and environmental committee&mdash;has looked at it on numerous occasions but has always knocked it back. On 20 May last year it said that the grant of $900,000 needed was too large for the potential, the commercial outcome was doubtful and it was not competitive against other projects. There are no other projects in this area. When it was reconsidered in October and December of that year and January and June of this year, it knocked it back for the same reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been able to get the committee to look at it again, but it has knocked it back because it said it is now going to be commercially successful and it does not need the money. No matter which way you go you cannot win. I believe that the government should look at this. It has great potential and I believe it is something the government should be associated with.

When I asked a simple question of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Training and Education (Mr Free), the opposition tried to stall the answer and not allow it to be given.

The local residents have taken this matter up by circulating a petition to try to do something to control it. The people who are actually pulling it down do not look to me as though they have had too much expertise in the destruction of buildings. I think it is one of those jobs where things are being done on the cheap.

If they speak out, they get some sort of sanction put on them. They might get demoted to some other part of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian government has state school teachers in such a bind that they are afraid to speak out in case they jeopardise their position. This has all come about because of the Liberal Party's manic obsession to close state schools and ship people into private schools. The Fairway Primary School was a good school. It should not have been closed down. What it is doing is putting not only the lives of primary school children in danger but also the lives of residents of that area in danger. I imagine that the government will soon sell the area off and turn it into apartments. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today the member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) raised important new evidence about the long-running case of Mrs Sylvia Faulkner. But he did not get the chance to tell parliament the full story of how the Attorney-General's Department, and in particular the Australian Government Solicitor, dealt with his FOI request. Even now the Attorney-General's Department finds it hard to part with some documents on its files.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Bradfield lodged his FOI request at the end of January 1994. The Office of the Australian Government Solicitor promised the documents by the end of March. A month after the expiry of the processing period the member for Bradfield appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on the grounds of deemed refusal. On 11 May the Australian Government Solicitor notified its decision on the documents. At a directions hearing on 16 May 1994, it claimed it had been very generous in its decision on the release of the documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In August, the AGS forwarded material it considered non-contentious. In addition, the AGS also gratuitously forwarded the New South Wales court judgment and which drew particular attention to the judge's finding that Mr Faulkner emerged from the case with no credibility. This can only be taken as a clumsy attempt to dissuade the member for Bradfield from pursuing the Faulkner issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 15 September, the AGS forwarded the decision maker's affidavit, which claimed additional grounds for exemption under section 41 of the act. Yet on 22 September at the AAT hearing the AGS filed a new affidavit which dropped most of the section 41 exemptions. The AGS then argued to the tribunal that most of the material remaining in the dispute was irrelevant. Given the AGS's track record, the AAT was asked to rule on whether or not this actually was irrelevant. It decided overwhelmingly in favour of the applicant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The material that the AGS claimed was irrelevant&mdash;and which it has now been forced to release&mdash;relates to discussions of indemnity for Mr Flint, a witness in the case, and the bearing of former Brigadier Flint's testimony on his pension and, most pertinently, records the remarks of the Commonwealth as `buying truth'. One item to turn up in documents connected with the FOI application was a file note recording the AGS's consultation with the Solicitor-General on this FOI request. It reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Griffith&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the Solicitor-General&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">said that he had no objection to release of the documents. He suggested that a copy of the judgment could also be provided `with compliments'.</PARA>
<PARA>The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) should be appalled not only that the Solicitor-General sought to deter an FOI applicant but also that the person who recommended limits on Sylvia Faulkner's legal assistance clearly holds prejudices against the Faulkners. Material uncovered by this application revealed that the Commonwealth government has engaged in an attempted cover-up. It has engaged in what amounts to a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. The Attorney-General needs to answer for this. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) It is considered that, having regard to the disciplinary and administrative action taken against certain individuals, appropriate and proper disciplinary action was taken in response to the findings of the Board of Inquiry into Private Cave's unfortunate death.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Yes. The officer in charge of the practice in which Private Cave was killed did face a General Court Martial to answer 14 charges relating to the activity.

The court martial found the member not guilty on the remaining seven charges. I do not intend to detail the reasons why the member was found not guilty on each charge. However, you can be assured that due legal consideration was given to each charge and that on the basis of evidence provided the court found insufficient justification to deliver a guilty verdict on any charge.</PARA>
