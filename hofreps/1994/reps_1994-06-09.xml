<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill amends the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948&mdash;the PCS Act, the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Amendment Act 1981, and the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Amendment Act 1983. The main purpose of the amendments is to allow the parliamentary contributory superannuation scheme to comply with the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 and associated acts and regulations, referred to as the SI(S) legislation, in relation to the vesting and preservation of members' benefits, and disclosure of information to members of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opportunity is also being taken to correct a number of inequities in aspects of the scheme. Amendments are being made to the arrangements covering the reduction of former members' pensions when they hold offices of profit, invalidity retirements, service in state and territory parliaments, as well as in the Commonwealth parliament, and a minor amendment is being made to spouse benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will recall that the SI(S) legislation provides for the prudent management of certain superannuation funds, particularly with regard to the security of members' moneys, and for certain minimum standards. The parliamentary contributory superannuation scheme is an unfunded scheme, that is, there is no separately invested fund and members' contributions of 11 1/2 percent of their salary are paid into the consolidated revenue fund. Consequently, many of the SI(S) provisions are not relevant to the scheme. However, the government has decided that all Commonwealth schemes that are completely unfunded will comply with the main operative provisions of the SI(S) legislation, that is, vesting, preservation and disclosure of information to fund members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the vesting aspect first, the SI(S) legislation and the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 taken together require that all employees receive a minimum level of employer sponsored superannuation support. While the pension benefits provided by the scheme will meet this minimum requirement in all cases, the lump sum benefits provided where persons do not qualify for pensions may not, in some cases, meet that minimum requirement. Accordingly, the bill proposes `topping up' lump sums where necessary so that recipients receive at least the legislated superannuation guarantee minimum available to most other workers in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the preservation arrangements, there are no provisions in the PCS Act which require the preservation of lump sum benefits. The bill amends that act to ensure the preservation of lump sum benefits in line with the SI(S) legislation. I should mention that, in common with the arrangements that apply to all other superannuation schemes, the preservation arrangements do not affect pension entitlements as the pensions are payable for life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally in the SI(S) context, there are currently no provisions in the PCS Act requiring disclosure of information to members. Honourable members will be aware that the Department of Finance has provided members with annual statements for the last three years. Relevant information has also been provided to new members and to retiring members. The bill formalises these administrative arrangements by amendments to the PCS Act to apply the SI(S) legislation disclosure arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The PCS Act currently provides for the reduction of a pension where a beneficiary is the holder of an office of profit. Offices of profit are defined to include positions such as ambassadors, judges and positions that have judicial status. Many less well paid positions, such as part-time board members of Commonwealth and state authorities, are also included in the definition of an office of profit. Currently, most people who hold part-time positions lose the entire remuneration paid from the office of profit. This is a result of the current pension reduction of $1 for each dollar earned from the office of profit until 50 per cent of the initial pension entitlement has been removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill amends the PCS Act to decrease the amount of pension reduction to 50c for each dollar earned from an office of profit, and to provide a threshold below which earnings from an office of profit cause no reduction in pension. For persons who receive substantial remuneration from an office of profit, the current 50 per cent maximum pension reduction will continue to apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The PCS Act currently provides for the parliamentary retiring allowances trust to grant a member of the scheme an invalidity retirement benefit if it is of the opinion that the member's resignation from the parliament is made bona fide on grounds of ill-health. The PCS Act provides little guidance to the trust in making a decision. The current arrangements make no provision for the special demands of parliamentary service, as the invalidity arrangements in the Defence Force superannuation schemes do in respect of the demands of military service. Accordingly, the bill introduces procedures to be followed where there is an application for invalidity retirement, provides for three degrees of invalidity with differing benefit levels, and provides for a mechanism to review invalidity assessments once made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary superannuation scheme currently provides for the recognition of periods of service in a state or territory parliament in some circumstances, and for the reduction of benefits payable from the scheme where the beneficiary is a member of a state or territory parliament or is receiving a pension as a result of such a membership. Under the current arrangements, the interaction of Commonwealth and state/territory legislation usually results in the Commonwealth funding all of a benefit that is based on both Commonwealth and state or territory service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill amends the PCS Act so that periods of state or territory service will be recognised in the scheme only to the extent that the service is purchased through payment of a transfer value from the state or territory scheme to the Commonwealth scheme. If a transfer value is paid, the state or territory service would be recognised on the same basis as service in other employment is recognised on the payment of a transfer value. It is proposed that benefits paid under the PCS Act would continue to be reduced where the beneficiary is a member of a state or territory parliament, but would not be reduced where a beneficiary of the scheme is also in receipt of a state or territory parliamentary pension. Importantly, transitional arrangements are included in the bill to protect the benefits available to current members with prior state or territory parliamentary service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not possible to quantify the precise financial impact of the changes in the bill because of the limited application of the amendments in the relatively small parliamentary superannuation scheme. Having said that, however, the restoration or partial restoration of pensions to persons who currently hold an office of profit is estimated to cost $80,000 in a full year. It is expected that, in the longer term, these additional costs will be more than offset by savings made by the Commonwealth no longer recognising prior state or territory parliamentary service at no cost to the state or territory. In summary, therefore, the changes in budgetary outlays and change in long-term costs from the measures in the bill are expected to be relatively insignificant.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, I indicate to the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) that the opposition supports the Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill. We have a number of concerns on these matters which I might raise with the minister during my remarks. I am informed that there are some 223 members and senators contributing to the scheme at present and some 264 former members and senators receiving benefits under the parliamentary superannuation scheme as at 30 June 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These provisions arise from some problems with the operation of the scheme, one of which is the provision of invalidity payments. As the minister pointed out prior to the introduction and the coming into operation of this legislation, the question of how invalidity could be treated under the act was something which was unsure and somewhat uncertain. The new arrangements provide that categories of invalidity can be determined by the trust and, depending on the level of invalidity of a senator or member, the level of benefit which may be paid is then determined. We certainly support the clarification of that aspect of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also provisions in relation to lump sum payments whereby a certain proportion of a benefit can be taken by way of lump sum. I wish to raise one matter of concern about that. I am informed that, since 1948, some 75 per cent of former members and senators have qualified for the parliamentary superannuation scheme. This means that, if that proportion is maintained in the future, one quarter of all members of parliament will not fully qualify under this scheme. The reality these days seems to be that the average period of service in parliament is some six to seven years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the records of service of members of the parliament, we find that these days members are coming in at perhaps a younger age and are certainly not staying the length of time that members and senators stayed in the past. There are some notable exceptions, such as the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) on our side, and there have been others from the government side&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mrs Bishop" NAMEID="SE4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Mrs Bishop</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HK5">Mr ANDREWS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), whose period of service to the parliament has been of some considerable time. In each of the cases of those three gentlemen, their service has been in the order of 25 years, on average. Maybe the change in the pace of life affecting members of parliament is why, on average, the length of service to the nation through the parliament has been reduced&mdash;the average period of service is now six to seven years, which is less than the minimum qualifying period for the scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When people enter parliament at a younger age and perhaps stay for only one or two terms, their ability, in their mid-40s, to go back to a profession or job is proving very difficult. This occupation in parliament is now a full-time one and it is very difficult for most of us to carry on any other sort of occupation, unless perhaps one is lucky enough to be a farmer and have someone run the farm but, even in those circumstances, it is proving very difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People come in here from all walks of life and from all political persuasions and give up their profession or occupation, and do so at an early stage, and for many it can mean that they have to go back to working outside the parliament after a period of, say, six to seven years. If they are in their mid-40s or so, it means starting a career again because, in most cases, they have young families and it is not simply a matter of being able to retire, so to speak, on the public purse&mdash;far from it. So the ability to be able to convert some of any accumulated benefits into a lump sum to enable them to start their occupation or profession again is obviously quite important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We realise on this side that in a superannuation scheme, which is aimed at providing a retirement income for people generally, there must be a balance between providing a retirement income, which is the purpose of superannuation, and in this instance, because of the peculiar circumstances of parliamentary service, being able to have some of those funds available to, in effect, restart a career. Therefore, we are pleased that the amount of 50 per cent by way of a lump sum has been provided. It is something which I think we should continue to monitor because there may be circumstances where, if members are leaving parliament at an earlier age, the figure ought to be reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter which I wish to comment on relates to the position of former state members of parliament. I noted in the Minister for Finance's second reading speech that he made reference to this matter and said that the act would be amended so that periods of state or territory service would be recognised in the scheme only to the extent that the service is purchased through payment of a transfer value from the state or territory scheme to the Commonwealth scheme. He went on to indicate that transitional arrangements are included in the bill to protect the benefits available to current members with prior state or territory parliamentary service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality, of course, is that from time to time members and senators who have served in state parliaments are elected to the federal parliament, and the preservation of any entitlements which they have as a result of their parliamentary service elsewhere is important to them. I am informed by some of my colleagues, and there are members on both sides of the House in this situation, that they have some concern about the possibility of a disadvantage arising from this proposal. I noted what the minister said in his second reading speech; but, on behalf of them, I would like to seek some assurance that they are not going to suffer any impediment or disadvantage as a consequence of these arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am informed that some proposed complementary legislation will be introduced in the states in relation to this matter, but that has not occurred at this stage. Therefore the possibility of a lacuna developing in relation to this matter is obviously of major concern to them. Some assurance from the minister that they will not suffer any disadvantage as a result of this matter would, I am sure, reassure them. We are supportive of this bill subject to these concerns being allayed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Library raised a question about the possibly unconstitutional effect of parts of this legislation by dint of the operation of section 44 of the constitution in relation to holding offices of profit. I presume that the minister and those who advised him will have looked at this matter. As we have observed in recent years, citizens of the Commonwealth have been prepared to take a suit to the High Court under the provisions of section 44 of the constitution. Whilst I have no doubt that the government fully intends that that should not arise here, one would not like to see the situation arise where some member or senator in this parliament was subject to a challenge of his or her position by virtue of the operation of section 44 of the constitution. I presume that has been well and truly looked at by the minister, but again some assurance on that matter would be comforting to those members and senators who could be affected by it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of us realise we have to leave this place at one time or another. Most of us prefer to leave voluntarily. Sometimes we have to leave involuntarily because of the results of elections, but I am sure that none of us want to leave involuntarily because of some technical difficulty with section 44 of the constitution. I would be grateful if the minister could address those specific concerns with the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If there is one thing that brings parliamentarians and the institution of parliament into disrepute it is the enormously generous unfunded parliamentary superannuation schemes that exist for federal parliament and also for the state parliaments. It is interesting that the Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill is getting very minimal attention, because I think most people in here are really aware of the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think these schemes underline the self-serving nature of parliaments and to an extent they make a mockery of the endless calls that we hear in here about concerns for the well-being of the public. Further expanding the benefits for members and ex-members on top of the recent salary and benefit rises is quite unjustified and is guaranteed to bring this institution and all of us in here into contempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a time when we have almost a million unemployed, when we have an OECD report expressing alarm at the widening disparity between the rich and the poor in Australia, and while there has been some dispute about that OECD report, I notice the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) has tried to defend the report on the basis that we should take into account the many direct payments that have been made over recent years and that the disparity is really not as great as the report shows. That is really not much of a defence because he is really saying that we are becoming much more of a welfare dependent society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is couched in very obscure and complicated language, but fundamentally it gives members and ex-members the option to take improved benefits. It is quite clear from the bill&mdash;I think the previous speaker, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), can be assured of this&mdash;that no-one will be worse off. We stand only to gain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The public are going to like the expansion of benefits for ex-members who are in public positions&mdash;in other words, making jobs for the boys much more attractive than they were in the past. I find this appalling when millions of low income workers, mainly women, have been forced to pay superannuation that they cannot afford and then have fees and charges use up most of their funds, yet we are making jobs for the boys, for ex-members, more attractive. There is no unfunded, fully guaranteed scheme for the average person like ours. There are no management charges on MPs' superannuation. We have a situation where it is just one law for us and another for the public. We cannot expect them to respect us for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer (Mr Willis) yesterday expressed belated concern about low income workers and superannuation&mdash;he is going to support the removal of fees and charges&mdash;but I think the general public can only regard this as so much hypocrisy. The basic fact is that we enjoy superannuation far beyond the dreams of the average worker. We receive vastly greater contributions from our employers, who are in theory those same low income workers. We can enjoy benefits long before we reach retiring age, unlike the rest of the community. I am sure other members had people coming into their offices because of the recent recession wanting to somehow get access to their superannuation funds to help them over a difficult period, and of course they cannot. They cannot touch them, but we can. Most of them have to pay on average for around 40 years and get far less in benefits than we can get after eight years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the previous speaker pointed out, this situation is going to get far worse because the average age of parliamentarians is dropping. We have larger and larger parliaments and the time spent in parliament is getting shorter and shorter. Real increases in salaries are going on all the time. To try to pretend that this is only a minimal cost of $80,000 which applies to ex-members in public positions is, I think, really trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the current scheme we have 264 beneficiaries and the public are paying some $12.8 million, which is indexed. That works out at around $50,000 a head and does not include other retirement benefits such as the gold pass. We have seen in the past that some people have taken another $30,000 each for gold passes. I admit that that has been restricted somewhat in recent times, but it would be interesting to know how many retired members might accumulate frequent flier points and get a couple of extra overseas trips a year. As I understand it, there is no effective way of checking on those matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum attempts to minimise the costs of all this. As I said, it indicates only $80,000, but that disregards the flow-on effects to all of the states and eventually the flow-on effects to the Public Service in general. At least the explanatory memorandum does indicate that it really is impossible to quantify the total costs. It is claimed that there are some offsets, but when we really look at what those offsets are we see that they are really only the federal government passing the costs back to the states. But the taxpayers are not interested in sleight of hand between the Commonwealth and the states. The fact is that they are paying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another indefensible arrangement is the administering trust, which is five members of this House. Would the public not like to be able to administer their own superannuation trusts? When questions of extra benefits come out, the members of the trust are very conscious&mdash;they are usually senior members of this House&mdash;of their own benefits. Without casting any aspersions on them, there is every incentive to be a lot more generous with public funds than with their own. They can allow extra benefits without any financial loss to the members because we have an unfunded scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am genuinely affronted by this proposal, and I think many in the community would also be affronted. I have had a longstanding position on this. I have refused benefits on two occasions. I say that simply to indicate a consistency of position over the last 10 years. I am not against parliamentary superannuation schemes. If a scheme were comparable to the public scheme, I would be very much in favour of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the arguments that people try to mount for a special case for politicians are quite spurious. In this day and age of contract employment, many people suddenly have to change careers several times in their lifetime. The old idea of career service has gone forever. We are no different from anyone else in the community. Other people can turn up to work on Monday to suddenly find they have been sacked. We have much greater security in a sense, and I do not believe there is a special case to be made for politicians. I think the public will be genuinely affronted by this bill. If we had any respect for the public, we would withdraw the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I presume nobody else wants to speak, so I will close the debate on the Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill 1994. I want to pick up a couple of points that were made by both speakers who have spoken on the bill. The honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), who spoke for the opposition, made a number of points and sought assurance on some of them. I think his basic analysis of the very short period that most members serve in parliament is correct. I think the average term is about seven years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although it is possible to see a combination of circumstances that would produce a parliamentary pension within seven years, generally speaking it would not. The problem to which the honourable member alludes of future members leaving this place without access to much of the moneys they are ultimately entitled to is a point of some concern to a number of members on both sides of the House. That matter is not addressed in this bill. Its impact is unlikely to fall terribly heavily on anyone who is here, but it will certainly fall heavily on people who are subsequently elected to the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way in which the community handles this problem&mdash;because this bill makes the parliamentary scheme like any other scheme in the community as far as lump sum entitlements are concerned&mdash;is through redundancy payments. Redundancy payments are not part of a superannuation benefit and therefore could not sit as a piece of superannuation legislation. Some of us on this side of the House are turning our attention to the matter to see whether there is a way it can be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commissioner of Taxation, as I understand it, does not accept that parliamentary defeat constitutes redundancy because the job is continuing. Nevertheless, the circumstances have all the characteristics of a person being made compulsorily redundant. Whether it has the technical characteristics is another matter. I think there is a problem in that members of parliament are unusually disbenefited compared to the rest of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point that he raised was the service of existing members. In these amendments there is no diminution of benefit for any person who has a state entitlement. Such people have the right to persist with the arrangements that are in place to this point. A `lacuna' might arise&mdash;that is the word that he used&mdash;in the possibility that these changes could produce a better benefit. In other words, there is a possibility, if state legislation is passed in a certain way, that the combined total of the two benefits may exceed the benefit that would now be obtained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is only a possibility because these schemes have a series of ramifications associated with them that may produce one effect for one person and a different effect for another person depending on their terms of service, the extent of time they may have served in ministries and so on. Unless the states pass complementary legislation, the possibility of additional benefits being obtained by existing members of parliament will not exist. There is also the possibility that lesser benefits will be obtained by members of parliament who choose to opt into this arrangement if the state legislation reads in that way. The principal point is that, while it is possible for better or worse options to be offered via state legislation to existing members of this parliament, it is not possible for them to be offered worse options than they currently experience if they choose to stay with the arrangements that are currently in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue relating to section 44 of the constitution has been raised informally with my department. It has had opinions expressed to it on this. I am advised that no problem arises with this section. This legislation brings the parliamentary scheme as close as it possibly can to the experience in the general community. As the previous speaker, the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack), said, it is true that the parliamentary scheme is a generous one in comparison to most schemes. But the gap is closing quite substantially. The honourable member said that people would, through their lives, locate themselves in a number of different superannuation schemes. That is a perfectly valid analysis. This legislation brings the parliamentary scheme closer to that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation assumes that most members of parliament will come in here with some form of superannuation cover. Up to this point in time many will not have unless they were state or federal public servants or state parliamentarians. If people change employment, most schemes that are confronted in the general community will offer those people the opportunity to buy into the scheme connected with their next employment or to stick, effectively, with an accumulation of schemes. This legislation will do exactly the same thing for the parliamentary scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been quite a substantial attack on the motivation of existing members of parliament. In our defence, whilst it is true that this is an unfunded scheme and benefits are substantial, it is also true that there would be very few people in the community and very few people for many years to come who would contribute from their own income anything like the amount that is imposed on members of parliament in this place. We contribute 11 1/2 per cent of our income. Most other superannuation schemes have contributory arrangements that are much less than that. The benefits we emerge with at the end of the day have not been accrued without some degree of sacrifice on our part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sacrifice has been so extensive that in the state area, but not in the federal area, one or two state politicians have chosen to opt out of their schemes and to keep their contributions because they felt they would be much better off. I think they were unwise in their judgment, but the personal contribution of members of parliament is so substantial that that issue does arise for many people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am able to give the opposition spokesman the assurances that he seeks to most of the concerns he expressed. I cannot give him an assurance on the first problem that he mentioned. I think that is a matter for ongoing discussion and trust between members of this place. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill proposes amendments to the Industrial Relations Act 1988 which would suspend for three years the age discrimination provisions of that act in relation to junior wage rates. This issue was foreshadowed in the government's Working Nation white paper on employment and growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These provisions were included in the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993 as a result of amendments in the Senate in December last year. Although the Senate amendments required that junior wage rates be removed from all federal awards as they are progressively reviewed under the act by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, they did not allow for a transition period. These provisions are also creating difficulties for new agreements and awards, because some employers have not had sufficient time to adapt to the new requirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has received representations suggesting that many parties, particularly those whose awards would be examined early in the first statutory review period, would not be able to adjust to the new requirements in time. The government considers that an orderly change to competency based wages can be achieved within three years and regards this as a reasonable transition period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is concerned that the existing requirements of the act may create difficulties for that orderly transition, given that many parties appear to need more time to develop wage arrangements that pay workers on the basis of their skill and capacity rather than their age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will modify the effect of the four provisions in the act that prevent age discrimination. They are to be suspended to the extent that they apply to discrimination because an employee has not reached a particular age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions concerned are for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to review all awards over a three-year cycle beginning on 22 June 1994; for the commission to certify agreements and to approve enterprise flexibility agreements; and a provision contained in the act's principal object. The period of suspension in each case would correspond with the first three-year cycle of award reviews under section 150A of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, this aspect of the age discrimination provisions would commence in relation to wage rates on 22 June 1997. All other grounds of award review would commence on 22 June 1994. This would result in the commission's only applying the age discrimination element of section 150A in the second and subsequent three-year cycles of award reviews. Similarly, agreements which contained wage rates that discriminated on the basis of age could not be approved or certified under the act from 22 June 1997. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government remains committed to the general policy of preventing and eliminating age discrimination. However, the government has been persuaded that a suspension of the relevant provisions of the act would facilitate the orderly introduction of more appropriate arrangements for junior rates. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendments concerning termination of employment</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish to foreshadow amendments to the bill that relate to the termination of employment provisions of the Industrial Relations Act. The proposed amendments, which were announced by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) on 30 May 1994, will change certain aspects of those provisions, namely: who is covered by the termination of employment provisions; the amounts of compensation that can be awarded by the court; and where the onus of proof lies in proceedings before the court. The termination of employment provisions are part of a safety net of statutory minimum entitlements for employees who do not have adequate alternative remedies. This protection is contained in part VIA of the Industrial Relations Act, which took effect on 30 March 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Broadly expressed, the termination of employment provisions have the following features.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the act, an employer must have a valid reason for dismissing an employee. That reason must be connected with the employee's conduct or capacity or the operational requirements of the employer's business. An employee must be allowed to respond to any alleged grounds of dismissal, except if the employer could not be reasonably expected to give that opportunity to the employee. Employees must be given specified periods of notice or pay in lieu of that notice, unless that is not reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act also prohibits dismissals on various discriminatory grounds. Some reasonable exceptions are allowed. There are also consultation and notification provisions in respect of redundancies. If someone is sacked and wants to challenge the dismissal, the Industrial Relations Court can decide whether the dismissal was fair, unless there is an adequate alternative remedy available under other federal or state laws. Conciliation occurs before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in the usual case. If conciliation fails and the employer cannot justify the dismissal, under the current law the court can order the employee's reinstatement or the payment of compensation or both. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These provisions are to be modified in the following ways. The amendments will confine the termination provisions to employees who are either employed under a federal or state award or whose base wage is no more than $60,000 per year. This amount is to be indexed annually by regulation to reflect increases in average weekly earnings. This restriction will not affect applications made to the court before the bill is enacted. The exclusion of high income earners who are not covered by awards is intended to ensure that the court's resources are fully available to address matters involving the lower paid and non-managerial employees who constitute the vast majority of the Australian work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be a broader power to make regulations excluding categories of employees from the provisions about termination of employment, as allowed by the ILO Termination of Employment Convention. This will allow regulations to be made to exclude those cases where the application of the legislation is anomalous. An example is where the statutory notice provisions could apply in a way which is not consistent with employment arrangements for which special provision has already been made under an award. There will be full consultation with interested parties before any regulations are made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed modifications will maintain the key objective of the current provisions, namely, to give employees protection against unfair dismissal. This is to be by reinstatement or, if that is not practicable, by fair compensation. The emphasis is on reinstatement in an unfairly dismissed employee's former position or one that has no less favourable terms. In such a case, the court will be able to make orders for the payment of any lost remuneration and to preserve the employee's continuity of service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The court will also be able to award compensation as an alternative where reinstatement is impracticable. This condition is not meant to be narrowly construed. It is expected that the court will have regard to the surrounding circumstances, such as the practical effect of reinstatement on the working relationship or the industrial consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compensation that is awarded instead of reinstatement is to be limited to an amount not exceeding six months remuneration. For non-award employees, the compensation will be limited to an amount which does not exceed six months remuneration or $30,000, whichever is the lower. This amount will also be indexed annually by regulation to reflect increases in average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The onus of proof in court proceedings alleging unlawful dismissal is to be altered. The employer will only have the onus of establishing that the dismissal was for a valid reason. The applicant will have the onus of establishing any other elements of the case, including that a dismissal was harsh, unjust or unreasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employers involved in proceedings before the court about termination of employment will be given the right to be represented by any association of employers to which they belong. At present, only federally registered organisations of employers can represent their members in such proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is proceeding with these amendments in advance of a review of the practical operation of the act scheduled for later this year. This action is being taken in direct response to some employers' views that the existing unfair dismissal provisions are an impediment to employment. The government considers that the concerns expressed in some quarters about the legislation are exaggerated, particularly since the court has yet to order compensation in any application under the existing provisions. Even so, it is not acceptable for the termination of employment provisions to be perceived as an impediment to the recovery of the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also appears that a number of claims have been made in the court in anticipation of more generous awards of compensation than have been available in other jurisdictions. This is not consistent with the purpose of these provisions, which is to guarantee adequate forms of protection for people who do not otherwise have them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments should also assist in ensuring that proceedings before the court are not delayed by unnecessary arguments about the adequacy of alternative remedies or arguments about the validity of extremely large claims for compensation. The government considers that the amendments will ensure that the provisions operate fairly and effectively, particularly for ordinary Australian employees who require the protection of the law against the unfair termination of their employment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the opposition let me say at the outset that we do not intend to vote against the proposal about the youth wage rates. We have a lot of reservations about what I might call the Carmichael regime so far as training wages in this country are concerned. We are not certain that the best approach to training wages is to relate them entirely within the concept of awards. However, the government is saying that it is not practicable to proceed with the removal of the age related junior wage rates at present and that they ought to be maintained over a transition period. I have absolutely no argument with that at all, and the opposition will not be voting against it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nor, indeed, will the opposition vote against the changes the government now proposes to the wrongful dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Reform Act. Those changes, coming as they do within what must be a world record short period of time after a bill has been enacted, will make an unsatisfactory act somewhat less unsatisfactory but will still leave the act as a very unsatisfactory piece of legislation. For reasons which I will canvass briefly in a moment, it is an act which actually makes the Australian labour market more rigid and less productive and represents a further impediment to the achievement of higher levels of productivity and international competitiveness by the Australian economy. I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: "whilst not opposing the passage of this Bill, the House, aware of the distress caused by Australia's continuing high rate of unemployment, mindful that a heavily regulated labour market contributes to unemployment, and conscious of the OECD's strictures of Australia's dilatory rate of labour market reform; reminds the Government that it has acknowledged the need for greater flexibility in the labour market, states its belief that this Bill will do nothing to achieve it, and urges the Government to abandon its Industrial Relations Reform Act which not only has failed to relieve labour market deficiencies but exacerbated them".</PARA>
<PARA>That second reading amendment encapsulates all that the opposition has been saying for a long time about the state of industrial relations and the state of labour market law in this country. I take this opportunity to restate my very strong conviction that labour market reform is the nerve centre of micro-economic reform in this country. We will never have a truly modern and competitive Australian economy until we reform our labour market. We will never reform our labour market unless we do four essential things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing to do is give all Australian workers, subject to adequate protection on the question of minimum standards, an absolute right without duress to either continue to be employed under the existing award structure or to enter freely and voluntarily into an employment contract which does not need to be vetted&mdash;unless it is the desire of the worker&mdash;by a trade union, the Industrial Relations Commission or any other body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To deregulate the Australian labour market in its best sense, we need to give freedom of choice. That is a choice that has to be exercised without duress and without fear of victimisation. Equally, to truly free the Australian labour market, we need to give Australian employers the opportunity to operate without compulsion and without fear of duress. So principle No. 1 is freedom of choice. It is a great Australian principle, a great liberal principle and a principle that is important to the future international competitiveness of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Principle No. 2 is that people should have absolute freedom of association. I know it is hard for those opposite to emotionally embrace the concept of freedom of association. They preach from the mountaintops about discrimination when  it comes to sex, religion and all sorts of other things. They carry on about age discrimination. The politically correct have captured every high point inside the bureaucracy that advises the government on these matters. They even have the nerve and the gall to lay down a set of guidelines in the Australian Public Service about workplace harassment. They virtually tell people whom they can have a drink with or whom they can dine with, but there is one thing they will never suffer telling people about: the compulsion to join a trade union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is still a fact in this country, as I speak in June 1994, that people are forced to join trade unions in order to be fairly and equally considered in the Australian Public Service. It is still a fact, despite what the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Johns) and the government may say, that preference is given to people who belong to trade unions. I know of men and women who at the moment cannot get voluntary redundancies, because they do not belong to unions. I know of somebody who has been employed by a government agency for 29 years and who, out of conscientious belief, has never joined a trade union. This man was entitled to a voluntary redundancy, and he was told that he could not have it unless he paid 10 years back union dues. Ten years! That is blackmail. The minister grins.

You lecture and preach and harass and hector from the other side of the House about discrimination, human rights and about the equality of men and women in our society. What kind of equality is it that will allow a great commercial agency of this country to do that sort of thing? What kind of fairness is it to put an advertisement in a newspaper calling for applicants for one of the DEET programs and, at the bottom of the advertisement, to say that preference will be given to people who belong to the Public Sector Union? That happened only a few months ago. All of us on this side of the House have examples of that kind of thing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not idle talk, this is the hard edge of discrimination. You can make your fine speeches, you can send your Prime Minister overseas and you can talk about liberty, equality and fraternity while he rubbishes our flag and our constitution in a foreign country. What about a bit of liberty, equality and fraternity here in Australia when it comes to freedom of choice?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an absolute cornerstone of what we believe in for a free labour market that people have freedom of choice. They should have a right to decide whether or not they belong to a union. That should apply whether a person is a metalworker, a doctor, a lawyer, a rugby league player or a shearer. It does not matter. There should be complete freedom of association right across the board. It does not exist at present. The concomitant of that must be that, if a person decides to join a union, he should not suffer any victimisation or punishment in consequence of that decision. It has always been part of our policy that people should be free to join unions, free of victimisation or punishment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us examine our voting record on this. At no stage have we ever voted against provisions of legislation guaranteeing people who join a union protection against victimisation. Yet, time and again, you have voted not only against protections in industrial relations legislation but also against guarantees in human rights legislation and against guarantees about freedom of association. The second great principle on which our approach to IR is built is total freedom of association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third principle is that all sections of the Australian community should be equal before the law. That is a very basic thing. It is very strange to me that, in 1994, we should still be arguing such basic issues. A great document written in 1776 contained the very famous words: `We hold certain truths to be self-evident.' That was the American constitution. One of the things that I hold to be self-evident&mdash;and I would have thought every man and woman representing any party in this parliament would hold to be self-evident&mdash;is that all sections of the Australian community should be equal before the law. The truth is that, under the act that was passed a few months ago, you once again place sections of the Australian society, namely, trade unions engaging in certain forms of secondary boycott activity, above the law.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to the declaration of neutrality that you have made, Mr Acting Speaker, and I am courteously rebuked. You are always very courteous and I appreciate that, Mr Acting Speaker. It is self-evident that this government does not believe that one of the truths which are self-evident in our society is that everybody should be equal before the law. Let me illustrate my point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the law of this country which existed until the Industrial Relations Act was passed, if the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations, who is at the table, were running a business and one of his business competitors put a secondary boycott on its activities, he would have been able to go to the Federal Court and get an injunction telling that competitor to lift the boycott. He would have been able to do it immediately, straightaway, as soon as the boycott began to bite. Equally, under the law that used to exist, if a trade union had imposed that same boycott with the same consequence and the same damage, the minister's firm would have been able to go to the Federal Court to get an immediate injunction. That was equality before the law&mdash;same predatory behaviour, same consequence, same damage and same remedy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the changes that the government has now made and which we have voted against, that has been altered. The government has preserved the remedy if it is a company which is applying the boycott&mdash;it can still go immediately to the Federal Court. But the change it has made in relation to the trade union is that, if a trade union puts on the boycott, the company cannot go to the Federal Court for three days and, during that three-day period, it has to conciliate before the Industrial Relations Commission. Anybody with any atom of commonsense knows that, if you say to a small firm which is denied essential supply that it is three days before it can go to court, that firm will sue for a settlement, it will cave in; in other words, it will be put at a massive disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is necessary to avoid wasteful litigation, why did the government not amend the law to apply equally to a company; why is it that it does that favour for a union, but it does not do that favour for a company? It is a totally unjustified privilege which is being given to unions. I have no argument with unions occupying a central role in the industrial relations of Australia; I never have had. But I have every argument with trade unions being given privileges and being put above the law. Here is an open and shut case of how the trade unions in this particular respect have been placed above the law. That is the third principle that we are on about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth principle is that people who do decide to join unions should have a right to join any union of their choice. It is very strange that, even when it comes to a choice of unions, this union-driven government is so reluctant to give people freedom of choice. We ought to have workplace unions in Australia. We ought not be telling our workers that they can only join a small number of very large unions, many of which have no sort of coherent industry philosophy any more. We now have a combined mining, forestry and energy union; there is also that humorous example of where we have one union which embraces both clowns and journalists&mdash;and so the examples can be multiplied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are our four principles and, until we in this country embrace that kind of approach, we will not reap the benefits of labour market deregulation. The government keeps telling us that it has made great strides. I heard the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on the radio this morning speaking to a French audience. He rubbished our constitution and denigrated Australia's history&mdash;once again, in a foreign country. He does not have the guts to do it in Australia. Why does he not do it here? Why does he have to go racing off to a foreign country? He rubbished the flag in Indonesia, and he has despoiled our history in France. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has a lot to do with it because he was talking then about productivity and international competitiveness. He says that we need to change our constitution to do well in the world; if we do not, we will not do well in the Asia-Pacific region. Perhaps he can tell us why Hong Kong, which still has the Union Jack in the corner of its flag, with eight million people can have a GDP which is 25 per cent of that of China, which has a population of 1.2 billion people. I am sure the logic of that would totally escape our peripatetic Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Prime Minister did not acknowledge when he addressed his French audience was that one of the things holding back the internationalisation of the Australian economy is the rigidity of our labour market. The OECD told us a few weeks ago that, between 1987 and 1992, Australia's productivity growth was only 70 per cent of the OECD average. The OECD only yesterday, in a report on unemployment in its member states, said that rigidity of labour markets was one of the major causes of high unemployment. That same report by the OECD identified the rigid labour markets of continental Europe and Oceania&mdash;Oceania being Australia and New Zealand&mdash;as suffering, more than other member states of the OECD, the affliction of high unemployment caused by rigid labour markets. The OECD and many others have pointed out that the United States labour market is infinitely more flexible than is ours and, as a consequence, the United States has an unemployment rate of 6.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lot of evidence against this government's record when it comes to the labour market. It talks about reform, it runs scare campaigns and it talks about the oppression of workers. There is nothing more oppressive for a worker than not to be able to work; that is the ultimate indignity and the ultimate oppression. The government is running an industrial relations system which shuts people out of jobs, which frightens small employers out of taking on more staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has essentially admitted that the unfair dismissal provisions that it brought in a couple of months ago did have a negative effect, otherwise it would not be changing them. It cannot seriously expect us to believe that, after only two months of operation, something has to be changed for any reason other than it was wrong in the first place. If it had been in operation for a couple of years and those opposite had come in and said, `Well, look, it's gone all right for a couple of years, it's served its purpose but we now have to change it,' I could understand that. But, for heaven's sake, these unfair dismissal provisions have been on the statute book for only eight weeks. We were told when they came in that nobody had anything to worry about. But it was obvious from the very beginning that people had a lot to be concerned about and, as a consequence, the government has found it necessary to change those provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not think the government has gone far enough. We think the changes are better than the bill in its existing form&mdash;that is why we are not going to vote against them&mdash;but we believe very strongly that the government should have gone much further. The onus of proof is still on a person to establish the valid reason for dismissal. That will mean, in practice, that every small employer will have to keep a dossier on every employee that he or she has and will have to take a careful record and note of every discussion that the employer has with the people who are employed. Of course, for reasons I have already outlined and also made in other speeches in this parliament in recent weeks, other sections of the legislation are highly objectionable.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The workplace bargaining provisions, which are meant to give a new era, as promised by the Prime Minister, to people in the non-union sector, are of course a joke in that respect. The game has been given away by people such as Stan Sharkey of the building unions who has made it perfectly clear with his famous `ton of bricks' phrase that, as far as he is concerned, we cannot expect unions to stand by and allow employers and employees in the non-unionised sector to make workplace deals without unions muscling in on the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will not vote against the specific amendments because they make very unsatisfactory legislation slightly less unsatisfactory. But we will be pursuing the second reading amendment and, in the process, yet again saying to this parliament that the most urgent area of micro-economic reform in this country remains the labour market. It is still the litmus test of whether governments and oppositions are serious about micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will not have a modern Australian economy until we change the operation of our labour market, until we trust workers and employers at an individual plant level without unwanted interference from anybody, be it a union, an employer organisation, a government, or an interfering bureaucracy&mdash;whatever it may be&mdash;and until we change our industrial relations system. It is through that that we can genuinely have higher levels of productivity. That is why we propose the second reading amendment which I commend to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose the amendment moved by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) to the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill (No. 2). I want to deal with a couple of issues that he raised. The honourable member has a great belief that common law has always protected working people. Common law has not always protected working people, including the Tolpuddle Martyrs and many others. Industrial relations is a little more complex than just holding up the common law or the rhetoric of a lawyer. The history of our country and many other countries would show that, but the honourable member has a simplistic attitude that common law can solve all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member holds up the American system and says that unemployment is lower in America than Australia and that, therefore, America's industrial relations system is better. Many working people in America are working poor and have no dignity&mdash;and that is where the honourable member's argument falls down. If we look at the system in America in detail, we find that it is deficient. The Americans under the Clinton administration have been in Australia recently looking at our industrial system to see where they can make some gains and take some positive suggestions back to America. They have problems as they do not have an underpinning of their system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill deals with junior rates in awards and provides transition for three years from the old junior rates to a competency and skill based wage structure for juniors. In the old system, a junior was not usually older than 21 and rates commenced at about 50 per cent of the adult wage and increased with age, rather than skill. We should be building in a recognition for skill. In the future, using a wage scheme based on skill and competency&mdash;not age&mdash;is definitely the way for this country to go. We should be building pathways for working people to go down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A young person in Australia should be able to train in an industry and pick up skills and competencies to do the task. We then need a regime in the training and education system that allows people to move to the next skill level with an acceptance of prior learning. In the past, we have made it hard for people to move on to other levels of training. The apprenticeship scheme has been seen as an end of training, not as a beginning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Junior workers receive no recognition for their skills or for how competent they are for the task they are to perform. If junior workers are to negotiate and bargain for their wages and conditions, they have a right to have their skill levels and competencies recognised. There is no reason in the future why workers cannot have pathways, from being a junior worker to achieving a university degree. It will be based on ability and there will be no other impediments, such as no prior recognition of the knowledge already acquired. For example, a fitter should be able to become a civil engineer if he has the ability, and a carpenter should be able to become a building inspector, with recognition of prior learning. If their ability and skill levels are such, there should not be any impediments to slow them down or stop them from doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Junior workers have always been abused. They have had very weak bargaining positions because they have been tied to the adult rate. So, no matter what the level of competency, they are paid a percentage of the adult rate. In most industries, junior workers have always been charged out as full workers. If a third year motor mechanic services your car, you do not receive a discount on the bill because of his wage rate. If a cleaning contractor has a contract and uses juniors to do the cleaning, the savings are never passed on to the client. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Juniors in the future should have an opportunity to bargain by having their skills and competencies recognised. Junior rates have been in existence for 70 years and are common in industries where there is less skilled labour, such as in the retail sector and the restaurant industry. Unions have certainly recognised that there is a need for pathways. Many have been active in trying to solve the problems of allowing young people to learn on the job without compromising their conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue finally came before the ACTU Congress in 1989. The Carmichael report went into some detail of the changes required. This report advocated the abolition of junior wages in favour of additional training schemes and a competency based scheme called the Australian vocational certificate training system. The government has broadly supported this report and has sought cooperation with the states to enable young people to go ahead and gain skills that count towards their competency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the principal act ensure that junior rates can continue in federal awards and agreements and provide a transition period of three years for the movement from junior wage rates to wage rates based on competency and skill. This bill reflects those policy goals. There is no excuse to maintain the old ways. Industry can afford to change and employers have been given three years to implement those changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other amendments deal with dismissal and are mainly employer concerns. I think employers have been listening to their own rhetoric, but I accept that they have some genuine concerns. They have been taken into account in the amendments of the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Johns). People who have been involved in representing workers before a tribunal would know that, in the state systems in Australia, there have not been huge payouts. I do not believe that will go over to the new scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If conciliation helps to get people reinstated, to have the umpire used to sort out a problem, that is always useful. If the system breaks down and the employer cannot justify the dismissal, the court has certain obligations under these amendments, which I support. I support the bill and the government's foreshadowed amendments. I reject the opposition's amendment as being the shallow rhetoric that we are constantly hearing. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are here today to debate the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill (No. 2), which amends the Industrial Relations Act 1988. With the help of one of the attendants, I just measured this document. The act now measures precisely 24 millimetres in thickness&mdash;just under an inch. Do honourable members remember what an inch is? We have a one-inch document which indicates the depth of complexity that we have put into what should be a simple matter of determination of wages and working conditions between employers and employees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are here today to deal with, firstly, the Industrial Relations Act 1988. Last year we had the Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993, which was to amend the act. During the passage of that bill, we had amendments to the reform bill to amend the act. They were in two parts; some amendments were put forward from our side of the House and some were the minister's. We now have an amendment bill to amend the amendments to the reform act to amend the principal act. Today we also have amendments to the amendment bill to amend the amendments to the reform act to amend the principal act. It is almost hilarious&mdash;it is almost a joke&mdash;but it is deadly serious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The regulation upon regulation that we dump on industry, business and commerce in this nation is intolerable, and this nation can no longer afford it. The OECD report, which we have talked about frequently throughout this week, condemns this government for its approach to industrial relations. It says that if we want to do something about employment in Australia, relieve the dole queues and get rid of unemployment, we need a more flexible labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that. Even those on the government side know that, but they cannot take their fingers out of the pie. They have to continue to hold on. Why do they have to hold on? They have to hold on because there is this marriage between a political party and the Labor bureaucracy, which means that the ACTU has a seat in cabinet. That is why we have this whole mess of amendments to the Industrial Relations Act, which is already complex in detail. Regulation is piled on top of regulation for those people who are trying to provide products and services that the people of Australia want. We should be exporting those products and services to earn income for Australians to increase our standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The amendment bill deals with youth wages. It gives us three years to ensure that the transition to the new competency based system is not overly prolonged. If I had my preference, I would rather that this bill did not have a sunset clause for 1997, because I have some serious concerns about where we are headed with the training reform agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear we need to make sure that any new system we put in meets the requirements of industry, business and commerce, not just those of the training bureaucracy or the ACTU, which is the Labor bureaucracy. Those concerns are real, because a huge training bureaucracy has been built up around the whole concept of the Carmichael system in transition to competency based training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all agree that the old-time training systems were inappropriate. We all know that the age of young people is not necessarily a determinant of their worth to a firm or organisation. Their competence has a lot to do with it; how much training they have has something to do with it. Experience is something for which employers will pay. At the end of the day, experience determines the worth of the actions of employees in helping their company. As long as they have skills and experience, it is easier to judge the value of employees to the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any case, the government has realised the error of its ways. So we are amending the bill to ensure that youth wage rates do not disappear while this new bureaucratic system evolves. I certainly hope that it evolves with the complete agreement of industry and that it does not just become one more bureaucratic nightmare. If we wind up filling up the award system with training requirements, we will further exacerbate our problems with our inflexible labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The competency standards which are set need to be practical. When those new competency standards are put in place, they should not radically alter the minimum pay rates for young working men and women. If they altered them dramatically, we would see an exacerbation of the unemployment problem with our youth, and that is something that all of us would decry. These competency standards must not preclude experience. Employee experience is a contributing factor that is of positive benefit to companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill deals with youth wage rates. However, the amendments deal with the unfair dismissals court. We tried to tell the government when it brought the bill before this House that the unfair dismissals court&mdash;the Industrial Relations Court, which was set up largely to hear unfair dismissals&mdash;would find unfair dismissals because that is why it was set up. It has generated precisely what I predicted months ago in 1993. What I predicted would happen has happened: almost immediately the court's doors opened for business it was flooded with applications of unfair dismissals. Why is that so?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, have you ever met employees who have been dismissed who thought they had been fairly dismissed? I never have. I do not know any people who think they have been fairly dismissed. Those who have been dismissed from a job consider that they have been hard done by. Whether they have or not is a matter for some great discussion. But, if an employer finds an employee unsatisfactory, no court in the world will all of a sudden make the employee satisfactory to the business. A relationship cannot be established between an employer and an employee by a court or tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was an unfair dismissals tribunal in Victoria prior to October 1992. That tribunal was so logged with cases that it came to be the practical application of the point that those who were dismissed automatically, for any reason whatsoever, took their case to the tribunal. Why? Because, at the very least, the tribunal would find something in favour of the dismissed employee, regardless of what the employee had done&mdash;be that not coming to work, stealing out of the company's till, coming to work drunk or having unsatisfactory performance&mdash;or whether the company just could not use that person's services any more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I am reminded of a case in my electorate. A very small employer&mdash;a carpet supplier to homes&mdash;worked in an office in a small warehouse. He had one staff member, a girl Friday&mdash;a young lady who worked with him and did a whole range of duties. She had a better job opportunity, so he agreed to let her go. He put an ad in the newspaper and selected a replacement employee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the day in question, the new employee arrived while the owner of the business was having discussions with a client about what colour carpet the client was going to buy. The employer said to the young lady, `Would you just make us a cup of coffee, please?' She replied, `I do not make coffee.' He said, `Oh, all right. Well, the vacuum cleaner is over there in the cupboard. Would you just get the vacuum and clean up while I finish these discussions with the client?' `I do not hoover,' she said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So by about 2 o'clock that afternoon the two of them had agreed that the arrangement was not going to be satisfactory, that in fact it just was not going to work out. The job was not what she thought it was to be and she was obviously not what he needed, so they agreed that they would dispense with this arrangement. But she said, `Would you mind giving me the sack because if you don't then I can't get unemployment benefits if I don't find another job.' So reluctantly he agreed and said, `You're sacked.' Within 48 hours he had an unfair dismissals case on the books. That is precisely the kind of thing that happens out there in the real world. No-one ever thinks they are fairly dismissed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we set up procedures, rules and regulations surrounding relationships between employers and employees, we surround the whole relationship with legalism and procedural arguments. Employers in my electorate have found dealing with these procedures extremely costly. The employer, if he uses his head, will find that he needs legal advice and the legal advice does not come inexpensively. The legal advice is expensive and time consuming and the employer finds himself bound up in legal arguments. An employee may have been dismissed fairly and yet, because some very small point of a very long, detailed procedural requirement has not been met, the court will find in favour of the employee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with all of this is that it encourages unemployment. It discourages business people from hiring new people and giving them a go because they are frightened to death of the cost. As many employers learnt in 1990 and 1989, the economy goes bad and they are faced, unfortunately, with redundancies. Most of these people do not like losing their people, because good employees are the basis of any company. Companies do not want to lose their employees, but there may be no other choice and they are faced with redundancy. The cost of redundancy built now into our formal system is so high that many employers have personally told me that they will not hire permanent staff again as we come out of this recession because they are frightened of the high cost of redundancies if the recovery does not work, if we go back into recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same argument is used over and over again, particularly by small and medium sized businesses. With the present structured unfair dismissal procedures they cannot afford the time or the cost. The regulation requirements for discussion and notification of anything an employee does wrong make it extremely difficult for small business people to run their businesses, keep track of employees and get on with the job. What is the result? They work longer hours themselves, they hire fewer people than they otherwise would and we as a country suffer. We suffer because the unemployed do not have work they want and we suffer because we then pay taxes to support those who are unemployed so that they can live reasonable lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All these regulations act as a structural impediment to full employment in the Australian economy. That is why we are opposed to the Industrial Relations Reform Act. We are not opposed to these amendments as such because they make the situation marginally better&mdash;thank goodness they do&mdash;but they certainly do not fix the problem which has been set up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act is complex and the unions are still able to use compulsory arbitration for broad based craft or industry award increases and at the same time pursue enterprise bargains in other venues. We now have this dual system set up by the reform act which allows unions&mdash;not individual employees but unions&mdash;to seek changes to awards across an industry or across a whole craft which may straddle several industries and at the same time be negotiating with individual firms for enterprise agreements for changes at the firm level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One suspects that we are ultimately going to see huge confusion in the marketplace. We are neither fish nor fowl. We are neither here nor there. It has been pointed out by more than one internationally respected researcher that those economies that have centrally, highly structured wage determination systems and those that have completely deregulated labour markets do the best in terms of unemployment rates. The ones in the middle, such as Australia, trying to be a bit of the best to everyone, are the ones that fail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no encouragement whatsoever in this huge set of regulations for small to medium sized business. That is where employment growth is. Major business is still divesting itself of jobs and will continue to do so at least for the balance of this financial year. We know that because it has told us. It is still finding efficiencies and it is still shedding staff. If we are going to take up the unemployed, we need to do so in small and medium sized business. Regulation is killing them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employer after employer has come to me and told me about the difficulties they have with the superannuation guarantee levy. The paperwork is just a bureaucratic nightmare. The construction industry lives with the prescribed payments system, which has been a longstanding headache. The multiplicity of oncosts add to the cost of doing business. We know that our oncosts are too high as a percentage of our total wage costs in Australia&mdash;the OECD says so as well&mdash;but the greatest difficulty of it all is the paperwork requirement on people who are busy trying to produce products or supply services. It is that regulation, the paperwork requirement, the bureaucracy behind it all, that is absolutely stifling new innovation and imagination leading forth into new products and new services for the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The awards are already too detailed. On 21 April last year the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), in his now famous speech to the Institute of Company Directors, did promise to the country that we would simplify awards, that we would take all the details out of awards and bring them down to represent a set of minima for any particular award situation. I applauded that sentiment. It sounded great, but that is not what we wound up with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have wound up with awards still containing all the restrictions, all the details of how people work, when they work, where they work and all the conditions of employment, instead of being simplified minima around which employers and employees then sit down at a table and negotiate how they are going to work together every day out in the shop. That is really what it is all about at the end of the day. It is all about trying to finally divest ourselves of the age-old class distinction, class warfare differential between employers and employees. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact that the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill (No. 2) has been introduced into the House of Representatives at all proves beyond all doubt the incompetence of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) and the government over the handling of industrial relations. Like many other honourable members, I spoke in this place when the 1993 bill was first debated. At that time I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993 would surely be one of the most disappointing pieces of legislation ever to be brought before the Commonwealth parliament. It was a much heralded item of legislation designed to reform a system which was much in need of repair. Unfortunately, despite much huffing and puffing by the Minister for Industrial Relations, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the government and the ACTU, the industrial legislation before the parliament at present is woefully inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA>If ever there was any doubt as to the inadequacy of that legislation, it is proven by the fact that on this morning in June 1994 we are debating this bill. The bill in 1993 had very little to commend it. It was moving in the wrong direction, not the right direction. Even this government must be embarrassed by the constant changes and backflips it has been forced to make in the area of industrial relations because of pressure from the community, business, unions and, most recently, the government's own backbench. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the items contained in this bill is intended to allow three years for the transition from junior wage rates to wage rates based on competence by delaying implementation of provisions proscribing payment by age. The opposition is not opposed to the principle of payment on the basis of competence rather than age. I hark back to my days in law practice when we would often look for staff. We would put advertisements in the newspaper and, in times of high unemployment, sometimes receive up to 50 applications from people wanting jobs. Some of those people had newly left school and some had been out of work for one or two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great tragedy was that the longer a person was out of work, the less employable that person became. Those people who had been out of work for one or two years or had never been able to find work were more expensive to employ. On the one hand, they were less employable because they had been away from the discipline of school or the employment market for a considerable period; on the other hand, because they were older, the employment and wages system deemed them to be worth more to the employer. Clearly, the situation worked against those people who had been unable to get work and in many respects condemned people to a very long time on the job scrap heap. That is why I am in favour of payment on the basis of experience and competency. I support that principle very strongly, because it will give those kids who have left school and who have been unable to find a job immediately a chance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do, however, understand that this bill makes alterations by giving the government a little more time. As mentioned by previous opposition speakers, we are not opposing this proposition in the bill. One ought to note, however, that payment by competency, while a very good thing, should be subjected to a number of caveats. Firstly, the transition from one method to the other should not be used to hike the junior young wage rate minima, which would price even more young people out of the labour market; secondly, procedures for determining competency standards should be both realistic and practical; and, thirdly, criteria used to determine competency standards should not preclude experience. I think they are commonsense matters which I hope the government will adopt. It would be tragic if the move to payment for competency were used as an excuse for making it even more difficult for employers to put young people into a job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy of unemployment at the moment in this country is monumental. One million people are out of work, and a couple of million people are unable to find adequate work. It is very important that the government focuses its endeavours towards finding real, long-term jobs for people, not just temporary mickey mouse jobs or training scheme jobs that have no long-term prospects. Unfortunately, the government seems to be too keen too often to rort the unemployment figures by moving people from one training scheme to another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had a lot of complaints from residents in Caboolture and residents on the Sunshine Coast who say that they have been out of work for a number of years. In some cases, they have attended up to five or six training schemes and they have various certificates, proving they are competent in a number of spheres of activity, but they have been trained for jobs that do not exist. That was the tragedy of the government's white paper on employment&mdash;really it was a white paper on unemployment&mdash;because it did nothing to solve the problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a whitewash. I do not even know whether the government had a whiteboard. The other matter is that the government is reducing the amounts of compensation that would have to be paid to those people deemed to be unfairly dismissed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it was a tragedy that the government brought in these unfair dismissal provisions in the Industrial Relations Reform Bill. The provisions that were there were more than adequate. On the one hand, they guaranteed an employee certain rights; on the other hand, they left the employer the right to run his own business as he wished, within reasonable limits, and to hire and fire. While the minister has been forced to do a backflip in this area, the major problem facing small businesses is that the compensation limits which are being introduced through these amendments will not be an incentive for those small businesses to employ people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have asked a question on notice of the Minister for Industrial Relations. The question asks:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Did he state that Australian business groups were scaremongering about the unfair dismissal provisions in recently implemented industrial relations legislation and were worrying small business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)Has he proposed changes to the unfair dismissal provisions which will result in business proprietors paying salary for 6 months to unfairly dismissed award workers and $30,000 to non-award workers earning less than $60,000 per annum; if so, how will the changes address the concerns of small business proprietors.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, we know the answer to part of that question, because the legislation before the House makes changes to the amounts of compensation payable to people deemed to be unfairly dismissed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Around the electorate of Fisher and in the rest of Australia there are a lot of small businesses. Even after the minister announced his backflip on compensation, I have been contacted by many of my constituents. They ask me, `How on earth can we, who are earning almost nothing from our small business, afford to pay the kinds of compensation that the minister is saying should be paid?' And that applies even to the reduced amount of compensation included in the amendments. They say that it is simply not worth while employing people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many small businesses the employees are taking home more than the employers. How on earth can those small businesses afford the kind of compensation suggested by the government? My view is that the amendments being made by the government through this legislation will not assist to create jobs. One ought to remember that a very high percentage of jobs in Australia are provided by the small business sector. A couple of days ago the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans)&mdash;it was repeated yesterday in the matter of public importance by the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl)&mdash;pointed out that almost no government members have any experience in small business. I think it was stated that perhaps one government member had some experience in small business. This means, of course, that the government does not understand the problems of small business. I think that is a tragedy, not only for the government but also for the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we find the minister coming in here yet again to make changes to the legislation before the House&mdash;legislation that was put through the House last year. At the time we said that the legislation was no good and very strongly opposed it for very many reasons. We said that the legislation was unworkable, regressive and that it would cost jobs, not create them. The result is that we are being proven right. </PARA>

The minister should, as the shadow minister at the table, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), suggested yesterday during question time, come in here and admit that his legislation is a failure. This legislation will build the unemployment lists in this country from a million people out of work to even more. After 11 long years in office this government still has no answers to the unemployment problem. It has become worse. Instead of over the 11 years gaining the experience to bring in legislation which will create jobs and employment opportunities, we find that the government is moving in the wrong direction. </PARA>

Because of this, the minister has finally had to come back before the parliament with some improvements in the legislation, inadequate as they are.

On top of this, the union has the hide to say that it will charge $75 per participant for the administration of this program which it should have nothing to do with. Valuable taxpayers' money is being used up by the trade unions. The shires are willing to administer the program for nothing, but the trade unions are coming in, with the consent of the federal ministers, and charging $75.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through this process of abusing the external affairs power, the government is discovering more and more that it is becoming the victim of its own perfidy. The simple fact is that it is starting to get caught. It is getting caught, in the first instance, due to the complexity required in sidestepping the fundamentals of the constitution. The size of this legislation was drawn to our attention earlier today; it is nearly one-inch thick.

Yet the other day Paddy McGuiness, the noted journalist, informed us of a case where a convicted drug importer could not be deported from Australia, although he was not a citizen, simply because the magistrate or the judge ruled that it would be in contravention of the Commonwealth's commitment to the rights of the child convention.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government was caught on its own hook. It has been caught in this process because&mdash;as has been admitted by the assistant minister in this place&mdash;its newly created industrial court will need about another 10 magistrates, judges or whatever they will be just to handle the applications for unfair dismissal. We have heard from the minister statements like, `It was only the scare tactics of a couple of lawyers'&mdash;he was talking about the ones who said to the employers, `You're going to have to be very careful about this.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia the Court government has just had to take that action and the Law Society there was crying tears of blood. Western Australia was the last repository for millionaire lawyers, or so we thought, and of course they whinged and moaned. One legal firm that advertised regularly on television had a team of four partners and 100 clerks. It charged out the clerks at $100 an hour to work on every claim made for compensation. Most of these claims, of course, were settled by the insurance companies simply because they could not afford or were not prepared to expend the money on more court cases. It was a racket. Of course, every state premier, commencing with Labor premiers, had to fix it. </PARA>

Have you been dismissed from your work? You might be entitled to a claim. Come and see me. Your first interview will be free.' I bet there are some of those ads in the can now. If that is not the case, where have these 700 claims come from? The ads will be in the can because it was a very silly decision that this government made. It opened the floodgates when people like Neville Wran had had the sense to stop them in another area once before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We wonder why the government comes scurrying in here; it is not paying lip-service to the employers. It can see the whole system collapsing under the weight of thousands of legal actions. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), said, quite correctly, that nobody who is dismissed from his employment thinks the dismissal is fair. They all believe they have a right. Most of these people under this legislation were going to win in cases which involved smaller enterprises simply because, just as the insurance companies discovered, it is cheaper to pay. The cost of their day in court these days is unbelievably expensive and small businessmen have neither the time nor the resources to do it. </PARA>

It takes away from state governments rights that are properly theirs under our constitution&mdash;those rights are put there for the right and proper reasons&mdash;and suddenly we get the courts leading the way and telling the government its obligations in areas where it has never legislated before. This government thought at the time that it was a good idea to sign some convention and get a warm inner glow. Why does a democracy that is as democratic as Australia need to run off and bind itself by these forms of conventions? Why is it necessary?

You agonise over it. If you have a good person, it breaks your heart to hear that person say he is leaving. I wish I could say to some of them, `Listen, mate, I have put five or six years into getting you to the standard you are now at. You now want to leave for a better job, I am glad for you. But what about a bit of redundancy pay for me, your employer? I don't want to lose you.' It is silly; it is wrong. It is insulting to small business people to suggest that we need a law of this nature, because it presumes they have this desire to sack people. In fact half the time they are desperate to employ people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Lyons went on today about the wonderful aspects of this legislation in terms of changing from a youth wage and age related process to one of qualification. But he forgets that is just another roadblock to employment. If the job does not require the skill or the qualification, why should the employer have to pay the price? If you have a fitter, as I think the honourable member for Lyons said, who goes away in his spare time and gets a degree as an engineer, but you want only a fitter, why do you have to pay him an engineer's wage? Of course, you cannot pay that wage, so you have to dismiss him. That is, of course, an extreme example. </PARA>

<PARA>There has been considerable debate on these matters, most of which concerned the clauses in the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill (No. 2). I note that the opposition is not opposing the clauses, which are in two main categories. The first is to do with junior wage rates. We are simply returning to the original provisions of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill was amended with respect to age discrimination by a vote in the Senate, essentially due to a position put by the Australian Democrats. We understood at the time that that might cause some real strife, and it has, to the extent that we need a transition period where people can move from junior wage rates or age based rates to a competency based system. We made a plea at the time that there should be sufficient time for employers and employees to get used to a competency based system. We are now, with these amendments, returning to our original proposition, that is, there should be a three-year opportunity to allow for a proper transition to competency based rates. From my recall of the various contributions to the debate, I do not think that anyone took any exception to that, nor made any great comment about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second element is to do with the whole concept of unfair dismissals and how they will be picked up and treated under the amended act. I would like to pick up on a number of comments made by various contributors. The essence here is that the Commonwealth wanted to ensure that there were some minimum provisions&mdash;if you like, a safety net set of provisions&mdash;to allow those who could not get access to a remedy in the state tribunals or a federal tribunal to be able to come to our new court and have an unfair dismissal case heard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What occurred in practice was that the court thought that it would test the proposition case by case in each state. We moved from a position of believing we were giving a minimum right to those who were previously not covered to a position where people could prefer to use our system because it would award damages in an uncapped way. So we had allowed a system whereby people would jump from a state tribunal into our court, and that had clogged the system. We readily acknowledge that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now want to unclog the system. We are unclogging it in a way that allows those who have an application before our court to be heard. Hopefully, if it works out in that manner, those people should be reinstated, which is always the best position. But if they cannot be reinstated and they are to be awarded some form of damages, the new cap which we are now introducing will apply to those people as well as to those hereinafter. Hereinafter, from the date of assent, non-award workers with wages of more than $60,000 will not get access to our system at all. Our system was always meant to be for those who had no other remedy, those who were at the lower end, those who were in greatest danger of being subject to unfair dismissal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) talked about small business being worried about our proposals for unfair dismissal and the amount of payout. He should be aware that the compensation system in the Queensland industrial relations arena is more generous than ours. These systems already apply but only to state award covered employees. We are not introducing new rules but rules that will cover people who were not otherwise covered. That is the whole purpose of this. We are not creating a whole new world but rather plugging a gap for those people who did not previously have a remedy. In plugging the gap, we inadvertently let new players jump into the system, and that was unsatisfactory. I present the supplementary explanatory memorandum to the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are not going to vote against the  amendments to the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill (No. 2) as the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Johns) apprehended. I want to make a couple of comments about what has happened to bring about these amendments. I am referring here to the changes being proposed to the unfair dismissal provisions of the act which came into force only on 30 March this year&mdash;a little over two months ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It really is a remarkable admission that the minister just made. I do not think I unjustly paraphrase the minister in saying that he said, `We set up this new system which came into effect in March because we really wanted to encourage people to take advantage of the more generous regime, and then we discovered that too many people were taking advantage of it.' He said it was uncapped. He cannot be more generous than that. It was found that a lot of people took advantage of it and then, because too many people took advantage of it, the government decided that it had to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of that has happened in the space of eight weeks. That is a remarkable indictment of incompetence. It must have been obvious to the minister at the table. It was obvious to Mr Justice Wilcox. I saw him interviewed on ABC television just after he had been appointed. He made it very clear in his comments that he expected the new court to be inundated with claims for unfair dismissal. I just cannot understand the reasoning behind a government that would go into something like this, knowing full well that it would invite a flood of applications, and then, eight weeks later, turn head-over-heels and alter it. It really is a very incompetent way of running industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think what really happened is that the government's ACTU mates wanted a completely unlimited system. The government agreed to that. It did not really take the employers very seriously at the time. Then the government discovered, after it had been brought in, that very high income earners, in middle management in many cases, were going to take advantage of it. The ACTU said, `Well, we're not very worried about them,' and there were a lot of complaints from the business community. So the government finally decided to go back to it. However the government now tries to explain away this backflip, the fact is that, using ordinary principles of commonsense, it should have known it would be inundated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point I would raise, which I do not think has come up so far in public comment&mdash;it certainly has not come up during this debate&mdash;is that built into these amendments is a clear preference for people covered by awards. As I understand it, the $60,000 limit applies only if one is a non-award employee. That being the case, it means that many people whose salaries are over $60,000 and who are covered by awards will get the benefit of these new unfair dismissal provisions. I suspect that there would be quite a number, not large in proportion, in the public sector, particularly in the federal Public Service&mdash;but not only the federal Public Service; I do not want to pick on it: in fact, I am not picking on any public servants; I am just talking to the principle of it&mdash;whose salaries are over $60,000. But if people are not covered by an award, they do not. What is the justification for that? I do not understand it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether or not people are covered by an award, surely their rights in relation to unfair dismissal should be the same, unless of course the government believes that somebody covered by an award is more equal than somebody not covered by an award, using Orwellian language with which the minister at the table ought to be familiar, given the Orwellian character of some of the Public Service legislation he has spawned over the last few weeks. He is the author of those ridiculous workplace guidelines; he defended them in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> a few weeks ago. Why the difference?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be fascinated to hear from the minister why he is favouring people covered by awards. What is so special about them? Are they better Australians than Australians not covered by awards, or is this just another manifestation of the preference that the government has in the system for awards because awards are obviously more prevalent in the areas of the economy that are more heavily unionised. I would be fascinated to hear in reply from the minister why he is showing such a marked preference. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A couple of questions have been raised. As to whether we anticipated a large number of applications, we did. I guess it was their nature that worried people and the fact that a particular form of applicant would squeeze out those who had no other remedy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca), I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill presents amendments necessary to implement part of the budget package for the veterans affairs portfolio. The minister will be introducing at a later date a second bill for the remaining budget initiatives that require legislation. In addition to the changes to be included in the two bills, many of the important initiatives in this year's budget do not require legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget package for veterans affairs this year has been developed to address the most pressing needs of ex-service men and women, war widows and widowers and their dependants. The package responds to issues raised by the ex-service community and the report on compensation for veterans and war widows by the Veterans Compensation Review Committee, chaired by the Hon. Professor Peter Baume, in respect of the ageing of veterans of the world wars, and the different set of problems facing the younger veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Baume committee review was undertaken in consultation with national representatives of the ex-service community to enable the government to address issues which had emerged concerning disability pension determinations, especially following recent High Court interpretations of the Veterans' Entitlements Act and the fundamental issues raised in the independent report of the Auditor-General in December 1992 on veterans compensation. As well as the manner in which age related diseases should be dealt with, these issues included the relaxed interpretation of the meaning of the `reasonable hypothesis' test in that act as it related to the relevant medical connection between injury, disease and death and war service and the lack of consistency in decision making and the inappropriateness of laymen determining complex questions of medical causation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the recommendations of the Auditor-General would have resulted in a cessation of grants for smoking related  illnesses and a return to the civil standard of proof for determining claims, thereby leading to an overall drastic reduction in the rate of successful claims. As is obvious from the package, not all of the recommendations have been adopted, but the government was bound to address the fundamental issues raised by the Auditor-General and to introduce sufficient changes to ensure that the integrity and fairness of the repatriation system is maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While these issues have been the principal focus, it has also been possible to tackle some longstanding issues such as bringing Australian merchant mariners under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, providing a better service pension deal for widows, widowers and separated partners, and enabling war widows to receive both their compensatory and income support pensions from veterans affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In developing this package, extensive, constructive and valuable consultations were held by the minister and his predecessor, Senator Faulkner, with the ex-service community. These consultations are welcomed by both the government and the ex-service community and it is the minister's hope that we may continue to work together in the future to provide the best possible care and recognition for our veterans and their dependants. This budget package has received wide support from the ex-service community and I believe that this is in part due to the involvement that group has had in developing these initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget initiatives have from the outset been a package. Indeed, senior representatives of national ex-service organisations agreed to the total package in full knowledge of the importance of each of the changes, believing that the final result would benefit the veteran community at large. Before I go on to talk about the specific initiatives in the bill before us, I would just briefly like to take a few minutes to talk about some of the very important budget initiatives for veterans and their dependants which do not require legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget includes an $8.9 million boost to aged care over the next four years with the thrust being to help veterans and war widows to remain healthy and self-sufficient in their own homes and within their local communities for as long as possible. For example, emphasis will be placed on carer education to provide training for carers of veterans and war widows who have come out of hospital and who are at high risk of injury or further hospitalisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of particular significance in the budget package is the $20.6 million which will be provided over the next four years to assist in the serious concerns faced by many younger veterans. These younger veterans, as well as their families and carers, will benefit from initiatives such as funding for a more comprehensive program for treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder, more resources for the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service and money for research into the health, social and vocational needs of younger veterans. Additionally, $13.2 million has been allocated for funding for the Australian War Memorial, for a memorial project at Kokoda in Papua New Guinea and for commemorative activities in 1995 to mark the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now turn to the specific measures included in this bill. Two of the initiatives in this bill are designed to ensure a more equitable and consistent system of determining claims for disability pensions for veterans and their dependants. The changes will involve the establishment of a Repatriation Medical Authority and amendment of the eligibility criteria for special and intermediate rate pensions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of these two measures, namely, the establishment of a Repatriation Medical Authority with power to issue binding statements of principles based on sound medical-scientific evidence, is intended to overcome these problems. These statements of principles will be legislative instruments and will be subject to disallowance. This means that when these statements of principles are laid before the parliament they are subject to public scrutiny and normal democratic processes operate to allow veterans, or veterans organisations, to raise objections with all political parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will, in effect, define by reference to such statements of principles the concept of `reasonable hypothesis', as it appears in subsection 120(3) of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The result will be that a medical hypothesis linking particular kinds of injury, disease or death with war service that does not have a sound medical-scientific base will no longer be sufficient to constitute a `reasonable hypothesis'. This will be a matter solely for the expert medical authority to determine. I stress that the opinion of a single medical expert may still be sufficient to constitute a `reasonable hypothesis', provided that such opinion has a sound medical-scientific base, as determined by the authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes are consistent with the ruling of the High Court that the validity of the reasoning of all medical and scientific material must be examined. They are also consistent with the regret expressed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and others that such complex matters are left to be determined by laymen. In this regard it has become apparent that lay tribunals do not deal with medical-scientific issues consistently and, while nominally inquisitorial, appear to adopt an approach that is inappropriate for determining medical-scientific issues that call for detailed technical knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Repatriation Medical Authority will provide the appropriate forum for the resolution of technical medical-scientific issues. This will ensure that there will be consistency on medical-scientific issues at all levels of the determining system. The authority will be an independent body consisting of five eminent medical specialists. The minister will be appointing the members of the authority after consultation with the ex-service community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The authority will prepare generic statements of principles based on sound medical-scientific evidence that will state what factors must exist to establish a causal connection between particular diseases, injuries or death and war service. Decisions will then be made in respect of individual claims to determine whether those factors exist in the circumstances of each particular case. However, it must be made clear that decisions on the facts of a case will not be a matter for the medical authority but will remain, as at present, with the Repatriation Commission. Importantly, they will continue to be subject to review by the Veterans' Review Board and the AAT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statements of principles themselves, which will provide the template within which individual claims will be determined, will be binding on the Repatriation Commission and review and appeal bodies. Once again, I stress that these statements of principles will be subject to testing by the parliament, giving all sections of the ex-service community ample opportunity to raise any concerns that they may have. I stress that the bill establishes a comprehensive system of review of the contents of statements of principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Veterans, their dependants and organisations representing veterans or their dependants will be able to make submissions to the authority which will be considered in the process of formulating the statements of principles. They will also be able to request the authority to carry out investigations into the cause of any injury, disease or death, for the purpose of making a statement of principles, and to request a review of any of the statements of principles. Comprehensive provisions exist in the bill in relation to such matters, including provisions requiring the authority to give notice of any request for investigation and enabling access to information and documents considered by the authority in arriving at its determinations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally it has been agreed that a special mechanism should exist for dealing with particular classes of veterans, such as those that have been given special consideration in the past, in particular, prisoners of war and Vietnam veterans. Accordingly, provision exists for the Repatriation Commission, at its discretion, to issue overriding determinations having the same effect as statements of principle, granting entitlements to certain classes of veterans when it considers that an entitlement should exist for such classes in respect of certain types of injuries, disease or death. Careful consideration will need to be given to the use of this power, which is not, of course, intended to be used as a general means of usurping the function of the Repatriation Medical Authority. Of course, this power can only be used to override statements of principles by making determinations which are more generous than the existing statements of principles. The power cannot be used to restrict, in any way, a statement of principles made by the authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes maintain a beneficial repatriation system, including a `reasonable hypothesis' standard, as modified as I have already outlined, for deciding compensation claims for death or disease relating to eligible war service. There has not been a return to a civil standard of proof, as recommended by the Baume committee, which would have had the potential to reduce the success rate of claims, which currently stands at above 70 per cent, to the pre-1977 rate of approximately 30 per cent. The government acknowledges the special status of veterans. It is hoped that these changes will be effective in overcoming the maverick and fringe claims that have interfered with the integrity of an extremely generous repatriation system, without having to return to a civil standard of proof for the determination of claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes are intended to ensure that the credibility of the repatriation system is maintained and that medical opinions supported by little or no medical-scientific evidence do not prevail over the carefully developed mass of medical-scientific opinion. It will not mean that only mainstream medical opinion would be regarded as reasonable, but it will require any alternative opinions to have a sound medical or scientific basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister wants to assure all veterans that current entitlements will not be affected. The minister also gives his personal commitment that, if after 12 months the ex-service community can demonstrate that the new scheme for the establishment of the Repatriation Medical Authority and the issue of statements of principles has not achieved the objectives outlined here, the scheme will be reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second initiative relates to changes to the eligibility criteria for special and intermediate rate pensions. The former being known in the past as the TPI, or totally and permanently incapacitated, pension. The criteria for these higher rates of disability pension were changed in 1985 when it became clear that the outmoded terminology of the old Repatriation Act was enabling these pensions to be paid to veterans who had completed a full working life, after retiring on superannuation and other retirement benefits. This was never intended. The original intention of these higher levels of pension was to compensate those severely disabled veterans who could not work to support their families on their return from service. It was to be in only very rare cases that any veteran beyond the normal retirement age would be eligible for such rates of pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subject to certain exceptions and to protection of existing special and intermediate pensions, the changes being made by this bill reinforce that intention. They will mean that these pensions will not normally be granted to veterans who are over 65. An exception to this rule will apply if the veteran was engaged in remunerative work after the age of 65 and that work was in the same business or employment in which the veteran had been working for 10 continuous years. This would include, for example, many in the farming community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me assure honourable members that this measure applies only to veterans who, after 1 June 1994, claim special or intermediate rate pension&mdash;and I stress after they have turned 65. Existing special and intermediate rate pensions, whether granted before or after the age of 65, will not be affected by the change. Furthermore, such pensions granted to veterans before the age of 65 will continue to be paid after they turn 65. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me now move to another measure in this bill which I am sure will be welcomed and supported by all honourable members. Australian World War II merchant mariners are to be given the same rights and benefits as those available to Australian World War II veterans under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently the criteria relating to the provision of compensation benefits for Australian mariners are more stringent than under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, particularly with regard to the connection required between employment and injury and also, in most cases, the standard of proof. For veterans who have rendered operational service, there need only be a reasonable hypothesis linking injury, disease or death to the veterans' war service, whereas an Australian mariner's injury or death must, as a general rule, be directly related, on the balance of probabilities, to enemy action. With this initiative, mariners and their dependants will now receive benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. A further initiative in this bill will mean that existing service pensioners, as well as claimants for service pension, may be asked to take reasonable action to claim any overseas pension entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is clear that a successful claim for overseas pension may result in a decreased rate of service pension being paid or, indeed, no service pension being paid at all, it should be remembered that if a person does receive the foreign pension then they will be better off financially than they are at present&mdash;even if the service pension ceases to be paid. This is the case because the application of the service pension income test to the amount of the foreign pension received only reduces the rate of the service pension by 50c for every $1 of the overseas pension but only after the application of the generous free area of $152 per fortnight for a couple and $88 per fortnight for a single pensioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two remaining initiatives in this bill are of particular significance to war widows and widowers and to widows, widowers and separated spouses of service pensioners. The first of these changes will affect those war widows and widowers who, in addition to their war widow or war widower pension, are currently also receiving an income support payment from the Department of Social Security. The Department of Veterans' Affairs will now pay a new payment, an income support supplement, to those widows and widowers in lieu of their current social security payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The income support supplement will be paid at the same rate at which their social security payment would be paid. This change will enable war widows and war widowers to receive their income support payments as well as their compensation payments from the one department. Of course, if war widows or widowers currently getting income support payments from the Department of Social Security wish to continue to do so, they may elect to do this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second of these changes relates to the payment of partner service pension. The change will allow for the payment of partner service pension to a person who is the widow, widower or separated spouse of an age or invalidity veteran service pensioner to be made at the higher `single' rate. Currently, such a person is only able to receive payment at the lower rate of service pension which normally applies to a person who is a member of a couple. As a result, most choose to transfer to the Department of Social Security to receive an income support payment at the higher rate. Importantly, former recipients of partner service pension who relinquished that pension in order to take up a social security pension at the higher rate will now have the opportunity to resume their partner service pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, I believe that the measures presented in this bill represent major initiatives which will help to ensure the fair and equitable delivery of repatriation benefits to veterans and their dependants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was not the minister who had responsibility for the carriage of this bill through the Expenditure Review Committee process; I was on the other end of the debate entirely. I have to congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and his predecessor, Senator Faulkner, on an exceptionally well-argued case in relation to the Expenditure Review Committee process and some objections from around the place, as one might expect. They have got through what I think is a tremendously advanced package for veterans in this country at this very late stage of consideration of veterans affairs. They have every reason to be very proud both of the legislation before the House and of the other matters that were mentioned in the course of the second reading speech. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 is, as described, an important measure in the interests of veterans. I thought that the minister who delivered the second reading speech, the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), was a little bit generous to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) by suggesting that there were financial benefits to veterans. When we add up the pluses and minuses in the revenue for the government, we find that the proposed savings exceed the payments that would go to veterans. Nevertheless, in most cases they are not significant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This veterans affairs legislation should be divided into two areas. One area should clarify, simplify or improve the entitlements for veterans' widows or widowers. Various improvements were referred to in the second reading speech. The measures relating to the special and intermediate pension rate are sensible and overcome an anomaly that has been identified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition, whilst not opposing this measure, does raise the question of equity. It has been pointed out that people in their own businesses or in the professions would probably be more able to sustain the new criteria than people in employment who, for instance, had been retrenched at 63 and then got themselves involved in other employment which they could not sustain much after 65. I draw that to the minister's attention more than anything else. It is a small anomaly but it is a fact that some people will not be as well off under that particular provision as others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Put simply, as the second reading speech points out, the government is expecting to save only approximately $0.9 million from this measure. The second reading speech also points out that the amendments were originally directed to persons of a much younger age whose war injuries or illnesses had put them in a position where they were unable to work, earn a living, and probably support their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initiative on Australian mariners is to be supported. There is little doubt in anybody's mind that people who served in the merchant marine fleet were as much at risk in a war as somebody leading a charge up a Normandy beach. In fact, their casualty rates were extremely high, particularly in submarine attacks and occurrences of that nature. Submarines were frequently more interested in the merchant ship and its cargo which was being delivered to assist troops on the ground than they were with the destroyers and the other pieces of military seafaring equipment that were involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is wise to seek to gain foreign pensions for those pensioners who have rights to them. They gave service to a foreign country so that foreign country has an obligation to them, and that payment reduces the cost here in Australia. As has been pointed out, the testing provisions do not necessarily take away the entire provision because the reduction for that type of income is generally only 50c in the dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The partner service pension is generous, yet proper. It is a situation where once people become single, through the unfortunate demise of their partner, they will be paid at the single rate as set down in social security legislation. That single rate payment is necessary. The pension system recognises and everybody understands that, while two cannot live cheaper than one, an individual requires almost as much as a couple. Halving the payment on the demise of one partner is not fair. We support the government in its attempt to make the system more equitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The income support supplement is, put in the simplest terms, an attempt to achieve a one-stop shop. That is sensible and to be congratulated. The minister in his response might like to answer a question that has been put to me concerning the circumstances that apply to many veterans' pensions. I would like to know with regard to asset and income testing how the transfer of benefits of people coming out of the social security system, which is the subject of quite detailed asset and income testing, to the VEA will be treated. It is not a matter of concern or a matter which would cause us to oppose, but there are some differences and I think the veterans community should know what those rules are and whether or not they are bringing over any of the social security requirements that do not apply to the veterans area if they seek that transfer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the issues with which the opposition has no concern. We support them and we support the statements in the second reading speech that they are all worthwhile changes to the act and will generally not harm the interests of veterans and in some cases will be beneficial. Nevertheless, the coalition has grave concern with the other aspect. The other aspect is a new section of this particular legislation, encapsulated in clause 11, which seeks to create the Repatriation Medical Authority, which I will forthwith refer to as the RMA. The clause also seeks to define the RMA's duties and purpose. It is its purpose that is of concern both to the coalition and to the veterans community. The opposition opposes this measure in its totality and I draw the House's attention to the amendment to the legislation that I have circulated already and upon which we intend to divide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The creation of the RMA is the government's second response to the 1993 High Court judgment in the case of Bushell v. the Repatriation Commission. That in essence decided that, basically, any form of medical evidence supporting the veteran applicant's case was sufficient to create reasonable doubt in the eyes of the Repatriation Commission. The current test, the standard of proof that is required is the reverse criminal standard; that is, based on a reasonable hypothesis. I have always had a bit of difficulty working out how there can be a reasonable hypothesis if the requirement is that it be beyond reasonable doubt; nevertheless, that is the way the legislation stands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Remembering that this is a case where the requirement is the reverse criminal standard, the High Court ruled that if there was any form of reasonable or sufficient evidence before the Repatriation Commission it was obligatory upon the commission to grant the veteran's claim. That is a very generous position, but it is based on the law as written in this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The veterans community, I might add, is gravely concerned and confused because shortly after the Bushell case, the Prime Minister went around Australia on another matter of great interest in the community saying, `The High Court has spoken. We are bound by that decision. We can do nothing but take notice of it.' He elevated the High Court to a position that everybody knew it did not have. This attempt to create an RMA, as I have said, is the second attempt by the government to overrule the High Court. The veterans community cannot understand that, and quite rightly so. Whilst the parliament does have power to change decisions of the High Court, the Prime Minister, when it suited him politically, went out and created an entirely different position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first attempt prior to the last election to rewrite the decision of the High Court in Bushell v. the Repatriation Commission was universally condemned. It was, in fact, eventually referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and simply never got out of there. It was in huge trouble with both Labor and Liberal members of the Senate and was still with the committee when the election was called. Therefore, of course, the legislation and the amendment lapsed. This is the second attempt. The RMA is defined in the explanatory memorandum in brief as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Authority will be an independent body consisting of five eminent medical specialists. The members will be appointed by the Minister after consultation with the ex-service community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Authority will prepare Statements of Principles based on sound medical-scientific evidence that will exclusively&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I underline the word `exclusively'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">state what factors related to service must exist to establish a causal connection between particular diseases, injuries or death and service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Statements of Principles prepared by the Repatriation Medical Authority will be disallowable legislative instruments that will be binding&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I underline the word `binding'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">on the Repatriation Commission, the Veterans' Review Board and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first point that must be made after just reading those words is that once these principles are made binding on the Repatriation Commission, why bother to have a Veterans' Review Board or an Administrative Appeals Tribunal? The same rules are binding upon them and it completely takes away from the veteran the opportunity for appeal on what are the fundamental issues in these cases. It takes most of the opportunity for the Repatriation Commission to differentiate between various cases. The issue is far too inflexible and harsh. In my view, all discretion available to the Repatriation Commission or the so-called tribunals of appeal are being removed by this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The standard of proof, and particularly the judgment of the High Court, has created problems for the government. Fortunately, to date they have not resulted in the flood of claims that was anticipated. That resulted in a reference to a committee chaired by Professor Peter Baume AO. That committee produced an excellent report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A fair go: a report on compensation for veterans and war widows</EMPHASIS>. In respect of the standard of proof, the Baume committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.The present standard of proof is unique to the veterans' jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.It is confusing and complex to apply, is subject to wide interpretation in the Courts, is excessively generous and offers potential for exploitation through "doctor shopping".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Interpretation of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bushell</EMPHASIS> case is that the "reasonable hypothesis" test is fulfilled so long as the theory or opinion of one medical practitioner eminent in the field supports a connection between the condition and war service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.The standard of proof should be changed to one which is fair and generous, while consistent in its application and legally unambiguous.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.We recommend the standard of proof be based on a legally accepted "civil standard" with the provision that the benefit of doubt be in favour of veterans with operational service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.An independent, Expert Medical Committee should be established to resolve general medical issues and to formulate Statements of Principle for application to all decision making.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not interpret the word `application' to mean binding on all decision making. This is the fundamental area of coalition opposition. I think as time goes by we will find veteran opposition. When I say `as time goes by', I mean that those complaints are starting to come in apace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are looking at now is a situation where the Baume report has been taken one bridge too far. I think most of those comments are sensible. I recognise that the government has a problem and that it has a responsibility to address it in some way. However, let me say at this point that, whilst we will continue to oppose the measures and whilst we will attempt today&mdash;both in this House and in the Senate&mdash;to have them removed, as the spokesman on behalf of the opposition and the spokesman, to a degree, on behalf of veterans in this particular parliament, I am prepared to try to negotiate an acceptable solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can see merit in having medical advice available to the tribunals, as did the Baume committee. Let me remind honourable members that one of the members of that committee was an eminent legal practitioner. However, I object entirely to the inflexibility of the proposal put to us today. I have dealt to a certain extent with the situation of the current reverse criminal standard and how that works today. In interpreting that, the High Court has been very generous. The Baume report had an entirely different idea about standard of proof. The civil standard would be more rigorous. It would not be as generous to the veterans community as the present reverse standard of proof. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government now has really got two options. It either goes to the balance of probability test, which is the civil standard, with the Baume recommendation erring on the side of generosity in that standard, and with some reference to medical advice, or it stays where it is. However, it certainly cannot go down the road that is intended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned that complaints are coming in. The Hastings Legacy group in Port Macquarie has gone so far as to get a legal opinion. I will not quote the name of the legal practitioner because I have not got permission to do so, but the opinion is under the letterhead of a legal firm. However, I will read into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a couple of the remarks made by this legal practitioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that he was probably coming to these conclusions at about the same time as I, as a lay operative in the law, was also coming to them. So this legal practitioner and I are as one on this. He used some fairly telling words. In reference to clause 11, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not aware of any other legislation in Australia which seeks to block claims for illness or injury by a predetermined set of requirements as proposed by this legislation. It is not without some significance that in comparison with veterans the persons who administer the Veterans Entitlement Act, 1986, are in a far better position to seek compensation should they be injured or suffer employment related illness&mdash;see Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. 1988 (as amended). Such employees are not fettered by a predetermined list of compensable illnesses or injuries. They are able to call such medical evidence as they require to support their claim and they have a right of appeal.</PARA>
<PARA>I point out that I believe that clause 11 effectively removes the right of appeal for veterans in terms of causation. The legal practitioner went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Better, apparently, to suffer a disability sitting behind a desk in Canberra than on active military service.</PARA>
<PARA>I would be pleased to give the Minister for Veterans' Affairs a copy of the full opinion because it may assist him in sensibly resolving this matter. The legal practitioner went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Until this Bill amends the Act, veterans have been entitled to call, in evidence, the very best specialists in various fields to support their case. This Bill, for the first time since 1920, and probably since 1916, prevents a veteran from having available to support his or her claim the best medical advice in Australia. From now on, a determination of Statement of Principles will limit their claim and, as will be noted below, the persons who determine the Statement of Principles will not necessarily be qualified to deal with many medical issues.</PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, is totally obvious given that there will only be five of them and given the diversity of illnesses and disabilities that veterans could have suffered due to their war service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, how else can you determine the circumstances of an individual? How can you write a set of principles and apply them to every individual in the country? I noted in the second reading speech, which I did not see prior to the commencement of this debate, that the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) referred to the government proposing some process that I presume gives some discretion to the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know when that was decided. I did not find it in the legislation, but I will stand corrected, because it just might be there. Obviously this particular lawyer did not find it either. The situation is not acceptable. We are talking about the rights of veterans. We are talking about a unique group in our society. We are talking about people who went to various wars and conflicts to defend democracy and to prevent the invasion of Australia, particularly in the Second World War. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people have put in something beyond the normal level of effort for Australia&mdash;most of us think of that as paying our taxes&mdash;and as a consequence they are entitled to special treatment. There were words in the second reading speech which reaffirmed the government's commitment. I can assure the House that we on the coalition benches view veterans as special. We see it as the responsibility of the crown on all occasions to deal with them and to err on the side of generosity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not see it as appropriate to have legislation that cuts off the proper rights of appeal where claims can be assessed, firstly by the Repatriation Commission, then the Veterans Review Board and then the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. They are all proper processes laid down by this parliament and available to veterans. We do not see why they should have to come cap in hand to some final situation when two of their main areas of appeal have been cut off. What is more, we do not see why they have to go before a minister or some special officer appointed by the department who will go straight to those statements of principle and write back, `I'm sorry.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recognise that the law is very generous since the last determination of the High Court. We think it probably could be amended but not in a fashion that makes veterans second-class citizens in terms of their entitlement to adjudication of their claims. That is what this bill does. It is very bad. Yet it was introduced with good intent. It has just gone, as I said, one bridge too far, and as such we cannot support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other aspects when one talks about the rights of individuals. I have had reason to write to the minister on a matter brought to my attention by an individual who, during the war, contracted tuberculosis but who, some years after the war, was cured.

But we know that that is not the situation. We know the government has a responsibility through legislation to try to tighten up this provision and, provided that it is done in a fair and reasonable way that guarantees the rights of individual&mdash;and I underline `individual'&mdash;veterans, we will support it.

If the government wants to maintain the reverse criminal basis of proof&mdash;the beyond reasonable doubt standard of proof&mdash;as an obligation upon the Repatriation Commission, fine; that is very generous. But do not try to nullify it by bringing down statements of principles that really say there is no standard of proof. The government is stuck with the rules. It is a very bureaucratic and, as I said, a very inflexible approach. </PARA>

I have used all my time, but I hope I have explained our position clearly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just say it again: the proposals for the RMA, as defined, are there, and the requirement that the principles be binding on the commission and the two tribunals is totally unacceptable. It goes far past what I think Baume recommended. Of course, if the government defeats us in this House, I am under advice that the Australian Democrats will ask for a Friday committee on this matter. I think it will go further than that. I think there will be a queue of witnesses. I have quoted the legal opinion that has come forward already, which supports my concerns that this is not the way to look after people in the veterans area. The faster we get this bill out of this place, the faster we can sit down and find a solution acceptable to everybody and the faster we will get better administration of this particular problem. </PARA>

I know that; he is an honourable man, and he has just made his position very clear.

That is why I have a bit of difficulty with what the honourable member for O'Connor has just been saying.

I am afraid that I cannot come to that conclusion.

Merchant ships were slower, ineffectively armed, if armed at all, and singled out for attack by the enemy. They were easy targets, as were their crews. I say what I have said in this chamber before, that in war, in uniform or out of uniform, all mariners are mortal. They suffer the same, they bleed the same, they die the same and those who survive age the same. That is why I am so pleased that we have this legislation before us, because, in righting that wrong of some 50 years, we will be ensuring that merchant mariners who survive today will now get the same entitlements under the Veterans' Entitlements Act as veterans have. That means that the efforts of merchant mariners are now being recognised nationally. </PARA>

It recognises all those merchant mariners from the Hunter region&mdash;from your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon, from my electorate and from the surrounding electorates.

The Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill is an important piece of legislation for veterans but it is being guillotined by the government in this place today. I think that is shameful. As the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) has already observed, there are a number of us on this side of the House who wanted to speak in this debate. I am fortunate to have been high on the speaker's list and I have been given the opportunity to speak. But there are others on this side of the House, and perhaps even on the government side, who are interested in veterans affairs and who are being prevented from exercising their democratic right to speak in this place today on behalf of the veterans in their electorates. It is deplorable that the government should choose to curtail debate on this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I assure the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) that we do not need to inflame the community of veterans on this or any other matter. Our concerns, that have been well expressed by the honourable member for O'Connor, are in no way scaremongering. In fact, I observe that the veterans community is very good at taking care of itself. The peak organisations that represent veterans have done so extremely efficiently for many years and I am sure will continue to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Shortland talked about early comments made and he mentioned Major General James in particular. There were early comments of support for some of these so-called initiatives that the government is putting forward, but they were just early comments and veterans were not aware then of the fine print. The honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) can laugh and shake his head, but the purpose of this legislation is as it says. It is to actually implement the budget decisions and it is here that we get the fine print some weeks later. Believe me, with this government people have to be aware of the fine print. People need always to be looking for the fine print, because this government has particular expertise in saying one thing and doing another, and its treatment of the veterans community has often been along those lines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Worse still, this government has a habit of bringing forward legislation which combines good with bad. This is yet another glaring example of legislation which attempts to combine elements which will make it very difficult for the opposition to be successful in opposing the things with which it does not agree. In my view, this is another little piece of trick legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We applaud, as the honourable member for O'Connor said, many of the budget initiatives, particularly the one that the honourable member for Shortland mentioned specifically&mdash;the recognition, at long last, of World War II merchant mariners. I am happy to give credit where credit is due to the honourable member for Shortland. He is one member in this place who, along with others, has consistently pressed for this initiative. I am very pleased that it has come and that recognition has been given. But let us not obfuscate the net effect of this legislation. One only has to do an analysis of the financial impact of this bill to realise that overall and projected savings far outweigh the costs of the implementation of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us be quite clear that the net effect of this legislation is to save the government money. It is no good for government members&mdash;ministers or others&mdash;to stand up and tell us that there are net benefits in all of this, because the opposite is true. One only has to get a calculator and do a bit of quick maths to analyse the financial implications and impact of this. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca), if he has got a calculator there, might like to correct my arithmetic when he gets the opportunity. But I can tell him that the savings to the government from this legislation far outweigh any generosity towards the veterans community that he might want to trumpet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, I need to say at the outset&mdash;and make the point very clear&mdash;that when we talk about veterans entitlements we are not talking about welfare. These entitlements are not that. They are earned; they are compensation. In no sense are the benefits that we are talking about this morning welfare. Most Australians, I believe, understand and accept this. Most Australians are fair. But, in this particular piece of legislation, I do not believe that the government is being entirely fair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I need to make the point that no other job is as risky as service in the forces, particularly in time of war. In this place, in recent days, we have recognised that many have given their lives in the service of this country in times of war, and many suffer the effects of their war service for the rest of their lives. Hardly a day or week goes by in most member's offices when we do not confront a returned serviceman or servicewoman who continues to suffer&mdash;40 or 50 years after the event&mdash;from what was encountered in war service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the member for O'Connor very strongly when he says that this bill should have been presented in two parts. Much of it is favourable in its effects on veterans and, of course, we support that. But the Bushell decision of the High Court, which this legislation attempts to address, was favourable for veterans. I want to hear the minister argue why the government is rushing in for the second time&mdash;as the member for O'Connor made clear&mdash;to try to overturn that particular decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a sense of urgency when the Bushell decision came down from the High Court, created by misinformation from the department to the effect that this was somehow going to result in a flood of applications and millions of dollars cost to the Australian taxpayer. But that has not happened. The Baume committee's report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A fair go</EMPHASIS>, has been referred to in this particular debate. A fair go is what we really are talking about, but not getting. The Baume committee makes the point that `we do not accept DVA's first stance of the floodgates opening with the advent of the Bushell case, and the floodgates have not opened'. The analysis which the department has provided&mdash;some of it is reflected in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A fair go</EMPHASIS>&mdash;shows that there have been, in fact, very few cases that would not have been successful but for Bushell, if you can make such an analysis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, this is the government's second attempt&mdash;the first time it rushed in here almost the day after the High Court decision; it wanted to change that decision&mdash;to override that decision, which was favourable to veterans. I need to keep making that point, because it really does form the basis of our objection to the particular proposal in this legislation. The Bushell decision was favourable to veterans, but not unreasonably favourable. I do not believe it was unreasonably favourable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about the reasoning of the majority of the High Court&mdash;the highest court and the most eminent jurisdiction in the land. The High Court made the decision that a claim should succeed so long as a medical practitioner, eminent in the relevant field of knowledge, is of the opinion that there is a reasonable theory which connects the condition with war service. I stress the word `eminent'. We are talking&mdash;as the honourable member for O'Connor has said&mdash;about a reasonable theory which connects the particular condition with war service. The government wants to change that. The government wants to make it harder for veterans to get what they are entitled to. </PARA>

The honourable member for Throsby can follow me in this debate, and I am quite prepared for him to tackle every point that I have made, point by point&mdash;and he will not get very far. The High Court decision on Bushell was favourable to veterans on the basis that it will cost the taxpayers money. The government's reactions to that, as I said earlier on, was an overreaction. But how much is it now estimating that it is going to cost the taxpayers? In fact, very little indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the projections that the government has made for the savings&mdash;let us turn this upside down&mdash;that it will effect by creating this new medical authority, the savings are not great: a few million dollars up to about $11 million, I recall, once we get to about 1997-98. So we are not talking about a lot of money here; we are talking about a very small cost. And the government is today attempting to take that money away from veterans. That is money that veterans may well be entitled to as a result of the High Court decision in the Bushell case. The government is attempting to take what I add up to be, over the next four or five years, maybe $20 million&mdash;$20 million that these veterans would otherwise be entitled to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for O'Connor said&mdash;and I think he made the point poignantly&mdash;this is strangely inconsistent with the government response to Mabo. The government response to Mabo was favourable to Aboriginals. Rather than attempting to circumscribe the effects, the government rushed in to extend it. The day after Mabo came down in the High Court the government did not say that it was going to cost billions of dollars; we had better do something about it. It came in and did the opposite. The Native Title Act actually extends the High Court decision in Mabo, and the cost to the Australian taxpayer of that is going to be billions of dollars. We have already seen some estimates of how much that is going to cost the taxpayer. I do not want to make the point too acutely, but there is, on behalf of this government, one treatment for Aboriginals and another treatment for veterans. </PARA>

The Bushell case benefited veterans. The government rushes in here the day after and says it wants to stop it. The Mabo decision did the same things for Aboriginals, but the government did not try to stop it; it extended it. I think that that point is well made. The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) can take on board that the point is well made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has concerns&mdash;and they have been expressed in detail by the honourable member for O'Connor&mdash;about the government's intention to create this new medical authority. The government claims that the initiatives in respect of this particular authority are designed to ensure a more equitable and consistent treatment of claims for disability pensions for veterans and their dependants. That is just not so. That is wrong. In fact, this will have the opposite effect almost. Consistent it may be, but we are arguing that the downside is that the very consistency that the creation of this authority leads to is a concern because one cannot, in a sense, be entirely consistent when talking about claims made by veterans for war caused illnesses or disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each case is unique. War service injuries cannot be put into the context of the medical science that exists for injuries that might come about as the result of falling off a bike or some such thing. Each case is different. Nor is the treatment, as the government suggests, in any way equitable. The honourable member for Shortland mentioned the process of consultation with the veterans community, but once again the government has been consistent on this score. The consultation has been inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very little time has been given for the veterans organisations to react to this. I do not know whether that is on purpose. It might well be that the government thinks that if it gives the veterans 24 hours to have some input into a complex piece of legislation, something entirely new, either they will not react or they will react in the way the government wants them to. However, I dispute that the consultation has been adequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The medical authority that is proposed will become a de facto decision maker on all matters of causation. It will  actually outrank the High Court of Australia in that respect. This is taking away a fundamental right and a fundamental part of the whole Australian judicial system. As was pointed out before, the establishment of this particular authority will mean that even the High Court will be bound by the decisions of this particular so-called Repatriation Medical Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Appeals to the Repatriation Medical Authority will be in the context of a statement of principles, the so-called statement of principles that are being spelt out, and not on the facts or merits of individual cases concerning veterans. As I have said, that is a most objectionable element of the establishment of this particular tribunal. No consideration will be given to the case of the individual, and that is neither equitable nor fair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Repatriation Medical Authority will be legislator, judge and jury. It will be a de facto determining authority and it will be the de facto determining system. Any appeals beyond it will focus on medical science or some such thing rather than on the circumstances of the veterans' service, which has always been fundamental to determinations in these matters. Despite what the government says, I even doubt its claim that the Repatriation Medical Authority will be independent, because its staffing will come from the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and in that sense it is not and cannot be entirely independent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government claims that this new system is generous to veterans. I have demonstrated that that is patently untrue. It is a lie to suggest in this place that this particular proposal benefits veterans. If one looks at the financial impact, the government claims that the savings will result in savings through to 1997-98 of $11 million in that year and so on back to now. So, in that sense, it is a lie to suggest that it is generous to veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will finish a little early, and hopefully that will give some of my colleagues an opportunity to speak. We are talking about savings as a result of the creation of this particular Repatriation Medical Authority, savings of money which would otherwise go to veterans. This is entirely objectionable. That is why I am pleased that the honourable member for O'Connor has indicated that we will move an amendment on which we will divide in this House. The people of Australia, and particularly the veterans of Australia, can make a judgment on this issue as to who is really interested in the rights, benefits and entitlements of Australian veterans. </PARA>

I am also pleased to follow my travelling companion through India, Bangladesh and Nepal, the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford). I felt that he could have been a little more generous in his comments. He finished his speech two minutes early to give his colleagues some more time. Some time, two minutes!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also particularly pleased, Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon, that you are the occupant of the chair for this debate, because I know the high regard in which you are held by the veterans community in your electorate because of your stirling work and the support you have always given to the veterans community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite come in here with the flag wrapped around them, but those who have really looked after the veterans in this country have been Labor Party governments. We have heard one Vietnam veteran speak and I think we are about to hear another, but who was it who really took on the issue and gave the Vietnam veterans the recognition which was long overdue? It was the Labor government. I find it a bit strange when those opposite come in here and suggest that those on this side have not always shown a concern for the veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that the measures in this legislation in regard to veterans have been well received in the federal electorate of Throsby. Despite the scare stories and campaigns that went on prior to the budget&mdash;and indeed the stories that have been circulating since the budget&mdash;the veterans in the Throsby electorate have received these budget measures well. I must say the transfer of the war widows and widowers support pension from the Department of Social Security to the Department of Veterans' Affairs is a measure that many in the veterans community have campaigned for, and I am pleased that this has been achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many speakers on both sides have highlighted various aspects in this budget in relation to the veterans community. There is one aspect that I particularly want to highlight, and that is the recognition of the merchant mariners. I am delighted that Australian World War II merchant mariners are to be given the same rights and benefits as are available to Australian World War II veterans under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this regard one must pay tribute to my friend and colleague the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), who has campaigned unstintingly on this matter over the last few years. When he introduced his private member's motion on 28 May 1992 and again on 18 November 1993, I was honoured on both occasions to be asked to second the motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me also make the point that this motion always enjoyed bipartisan support. Indeed, the members on both sides who spoke&mdash;the honourable member for Shortland, the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) and the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) and I&mdash;were the same people who spoke on both motions. From memory, I think the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) also spoke on the last private member's motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, as you are well aware, Australia is a maritime nation. It always has been and probably always will be. We depend on shipping for our exports and imports. Too often the seafarers who crew the ships to and from Australia are overlooked, and at no time was that more evident than in a time of conflict. Successive governments, of both political persuasions, failed to grant Australian wartime merchant mariners the same entitlements that were available to veterans of the defence forces, but now I am pleased to say this has been remedied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, this matter should have been remedied years ago. I must say that this government has a good record on correcting past mistakes. Therefore, why were we so reluctant to grant to these people who were prepared to give their lives in the defence of this country&mdash;and many of them did give their lives&mdash;the entitlements that were their just due?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eligibility for payment of disability and war widows pensions under the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act was based on death or incapacity suffered by Australian mariners as a direct result of a war injury sustained in the course of their employment during World War II or an injury caused by detention by the enemy during that employment. Compensation under the Veterans' Entitlements Act requires a less stringent causal connection. The distinction between `veterans' and `Australian mariners' for compensation purposes has long been a source of public debate and disquiet amongst the merchant mariner community, and it has been highlighted by two recent inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989 the inquiry into the needs of Australian mariners and Commonwealth and Allied veterans and Allied mariners, chaired by the then Deputy President of the Repatriation Commission, Jocelyn McGirr, held extensive consultation with interest groups and reached this conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As far as practicable, World War II Australian merchant mariners should be given the same rights and benefits as veterans of the Australian Defence Forces under the Veterans Entitlements Act.</PARA>
<PARA>A similar recommendation was made earlier this year in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A fair go</EMPHASIS>, the report on compensation for veterans and war widows by the Baume committee. The changes will give Australian mariners easier and wider access to the disability payments and related benefits available under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eligible mariners will now be able to claim for the long-term effects of their service, such as cardiac and respiratory diseases. Such claims have had little chance of success under the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act. Claims from Australian mariners will be able to be accepted under the Veterans' Entitlements Act from 1 July 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wartime experiences of Australian merchant mariners were comparable to the experiences of veterans of the Australian defence forces. Indeed, in some cases they were in more danger. Australian merchant mariners went to sea in ships that were not designed for warfare, that had little or no armour plating. Many of the smaller ships were unarmed. A large merchant ship may have had a crew of around 100; a navy ship of comparable size would have in excess of 500, including medical staff and facilities. The merchant seamen were constantly exposed to sudden attack by submarines, surface raiders and aircraft, with the added risk of enemy mines laid in the coastal waters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, as you know, the Australian coastline, especially in the areas that we represent&mdash;the south and north coasts of New South Wales&mdash;was littered with wrecks. These ships were sunk in my own area at Jervis Bay, off the north coast and all around the Australian coastline. Of the 73 ships attacked in Australian waters during World War II, 54 were merchant ships and 38 of them went to the bottom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many Australians served most of the war years on the dangerous Atlantic run on ships of various nationalities. These mariners were in particular danger. Enemy raiders were often given specific orders to avoid warships and instead to concentrate their attacks on the carriers of grain, petroleum, munitions and equipment, to try to cripple the Allied war effort. Overall, there were about 14,000 Australian merchant mariners engaged in World War II. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past few years much has been said, not least in this House, about Australian shipping. We have seen seagoing union membership restructured, crew numbers decrease, concepts such as multiskilling introduced and a career path for seamen established. Australian ships today are crewed by well trained, dedicated personnel. Yet, until this budget measure, there remained a black mark which only the government could eradicate, and that was the failure of successive governments to grant the Australian wartime merchant mariners their just entitlement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I want to pay a particular tribute to the new Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca). As with the honourable member for Shortland, this has been of particular interest to me for a number years. I remember saying to one minister on my side of parliament that there were not many merchant mariners left and suggesting that surely it would not be a great drain on the government's purse to rectify this. He said to me, `Colin, you know I am supportive of that and I support what you are doing. It is when we get to the Expenditure Review Committee that it is knocked out.' He said that in all genuineness. Within weeks of taking over this portfolio, the minister had this through. It is to his credit; it is to the credit of this government. The minister deserves the thanks of those merchant mariners who were prepared to give their lives. I commend the minister, as I commend the government, and I commend this bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept the words of the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) that this should be a bipartisan debate, but he did get in with a bit of a dig early in the piece by saying that it was a Labor government that looked after Vietnam veterans. I would have to dispute that. As a Vietnam veteran it riles me to hear some of those comments, quite frankly. It also concerned me that, on the first visit to Vietnam by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on what he called a trade mission, he did not acknowledge those who actually sacrificed their lives in Vietnam.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I am happy to get back to a bipartisan debate of the Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill because veterans should be looked at in a bipartisan way. I acknowledge that this amendment to the Veterans' Entitlements Act provides many long overdue benefits to the merchant mariners, the young war widows and service pension widows, and I commend the efforts of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) to this extent. But it removes from veterans the right of every Australian to a judicial appeal in a compensation matter for disabilities received in service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation creates a problem for veterans in the area of the standard of proof necessary to establish that more recently acquired medical disabilities of veterans were caused by their wartime experience. The Baume report of March of this year, commissioned by the then Minister for Veterans' Affairs, recommended that the standard of proof be based on the legally accepted civil standard, with the provision that the benefit of doubt be in favour of the veterans with operational experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It went on to say that an independent expert medical committee should be established to resolve general medical issues and to formulate statements of principle for application to all decision making. The fact is that the government has taken this one step further and decided to make this expert panel the decision makers, with no means of redress for the veterans&mdash;the panel will be the sole arbiters of war caused disabilities, and the only review under this legislation is from the same decision makers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1975 Justice Toose set down a set of basic principles which underpin the Australian repatriation system and, whilst no specific decision was made by the government of the day&mdash;or successive governments for that matter&mdash;the general thrust of these principles has been followed. These general principles were: firstly, the nation is especially indebted to those who have voluntarily given service to it in time of war by enlisting in the armed forces, thereby endangering their lives and health and probably suffering economic loss; secondly, the nation recognises that it has a similar commitment to those whom it compulsory enlisted in war service; and, thirdly, the nation has a duty to ensure that those who have thus served, together with their dependants, are properly cared for to the extent that they should never have to beg or rely upon charity. I think that these are very appropriate principles that we on both sides of this House should stand by. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the areas that concern me with this particular piece of legislation is that the group of medical experts is going to make the final decision on compensation for ex-service people. From the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) we had some comments about this package, as he described it. I thought he used some very interesting words when he said that the legislation `comes to you as a package'. He meant that the government is not prepared to adjust the areas where compensation is provided for veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a great deal of concern about that. I support the comments of the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) in his indication of an intention to move an amendment on this, because I believe it is important that we recognise the efforts that have been put into this country by veterans. It is a system that we must stand by if we are to expect people to serve the country in the way that they have. It really concerns me that members of the government are taking the line that they are not prepared to take this particular aspect into consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Shortland also talked about the consultation that has taken place. The facts are that a very small group of senior people in the RSL were sworn to secrecy about discussing this with the government and that there was no general consultation. The members of the RSL in the broader community have not had the opportunity to contribute to the discussion on this piece of legislation. I suspect that once they see the legislation and look at its intricate detail they will have as many problems with it as have people on this side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not talking about welfare; we are talking about the provision of entitlements for people who have served this country well over the years. I ask the minister, who I know generally has the interests of the veterans of this country at heart, to look closely at what we are trying to do to ensure that those veterans who have entitlements are in fact looked after. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House is today debating the Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill. When I was speaking in this place earlier in the week, I made reference to the appropriateness of the time that we are actually speaking about veterans. I said on that occasion that the consideration of veterans affairs aspects of the budget is timely, given the commemoration of the part played by veterans of many countries in the D-day landings. I think we all have been very much inspired by what we have seen via the media and television over recent days about the D-day landings and the importance that they had as the turning point in the Second World War.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is because of the sacrifice and dedication of all the people who were involved in that war&mdash;and in all wars&mdash;that we enjoy the lifestyle we have today. It is always important, when we speak in this place on bills relating to veterans affairs, that we acknowledge the contribution of many veterans over many years. It is certainly always a pleasure for me to have the opportunity to rise in this place to support bills such as the one before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initiatives contained in the budget have been developed to address the most pressing needs of ex-service men and women, war widows and widowers and their dependants. The package responds to the issues raised by the Baume committee and other groups with respect to the problems of the older veterans of the world wars, and the specific problems of younger veterans of more recent conflicts. I make particular reference there, of course, to Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was particularly pleased about the new programs designed to provide assistance specifically to Vietnam veterans. The $20.6 million, four-year package directed at the serious problems faced by Vietnam veterans is a welcome initiative. The cornerstone of this package is the assistance it will provide to the sufferers of post-traumatic stress disorder, known as PTSD. Anyone who has had dealings with sufferers of this condition knows how demoralising it can be for both the sufferer and his or her family. I am sure members on both sides of the House have dealings with Vietnam veterans from time to time, and they see the problems that they face. I really welcome the initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Veterans, families and carers will benefit from the package, which includes funding for the PTSD treatment centres, more resources for the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service, and money for research into the specific health problems and needs of younger veterans. This package will no doubt bring about an improvement in the quality of life of younger veterans by stressing better health and employment opportunities and improving access to treatment, counselling, rehabilitation and support services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another significant research project that will be funded by the initiatives in the budget is the Vietnam veterans mortality study, which it is hoped will be able to establish the major causes of early death and the nature of the links between PTSD and veterans' death rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other major projects include the establishment of a national centre for war related PTSD to develop best practice standards in the management of social, psychological and medical problems associated with PTSD; improved coordination of in-patient, outpatient and support services so that veterans with PTSD can be assessed, treated and rehabilitated; and expansion of the Department of Veterans' Affairs joint venture scheme to encourage self-help projects by the ex-service community to address social and personal problems experienced by younger veterans and their families. All of these measures, in conjunction with the dedication of the Vietnam war memorial and the welcome home parade held a few years ago, indicate that the status of Vietnam veterans is changing for the better. This recognition, whilst overdue, is most welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally important to the field of veterans affairs are the war widows, people who are often forgotten in some ways. They should never be forgotten, because of the trauma that they have certainly suffered, both in assisting the veterans and in being widows themselves. New pension initiatives in the budget will make life easier and less stressful for these people, and I believe that is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, war widows and widowers will be able to go directly to the Department of Veterans' Affairs for payment of their pension instead of going to Social Security. At the moment, widows and widowers receive their compensation payments from Veterans' Affairs but need to also go to Social Security for an income support pension. One of the initiatives in the Veterans' Affairs budget is the new income support supplement, which will be paid at the same rate as the current social security pension and can be claimed at Veterans' Affairs. Recipients will save time and money by not having to deal with both Veterans' Affairs and Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was pleasing to hear the endorsement of the budget allocations for veterans from the national president of the RSL, Major General Digger James, last month. I think it is fair to say that the RSL has not always seen eye to eye with Labor governments in the past. Perhaps that is an indication of the high regard it has the current Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca). As I am sure the minister would acknowledge, his predecessor, Senator Faulkner, also had a lot to do with the preparation of this budget and was also held in high regard in the veterans community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significance of Major General James's comments cannot be underestimated, under those circumstances. To refresh members' memories, I will just quote from his press release. Major General James said, `The 1994 Budget has good news for veterans.' He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new Repatriation Medical Authority which is being set up to streamline the vexed question of the causal relationship between veterans' diseases and injuries and war service was also welcome.</PARA>
<PARA>He concluded by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a very reasonable Budget indeed as far as we are concerned. The pre-Budget consultative processes with both Ministers were very exemplary and we look forward to continuing monitoring processes to ensure the intent of the new measures is fulfilled.</PARA>
<PARA>I actually made a copy of that particular media release available to my local RSL clubs and a range of sub-branches, and to a range of organisations which assist veterans. Both the media clippings and a package of material that the minister made available to me explaining a lot of things in the budget were well received. I thank the minister and the department for making those available. They helped, in a lot of ways, to explain what was in the budget for veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think most people would agree that those comments from Digger James are a ringing endorsement of the government's commitment in the field of veterans affairs. Veterans in my electorate, Oxley, were made aware of that commitment early this year, when the new minister made a visit to the electorate. It was the first visit by the minister to an electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We went to the RSL club early one Saturday morning and met with the veterans there and, I am pleased to say, sat around the table and had a good friendly chat. I think it was important that the minister could communicate with our veterans in that one-to-one way, to hear what their problems were. I thank the minister for taking the time to do that, because it was good. The RSL club has actually acknowledged that particular visit. They really appreciated the minister's time and his dealing with them on a one-to-one basis, talking to them and listening to their concerns. Once again, I thank the minister very much for his efforts in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that clearly arose out of those discussions was the support amongst the local veterans for the initiatives contained in the budget allocations for this portfolio. They were particularly happy about the new repatriation private patients scheme, which is already under way in New South Wales and South Australia and which will get under way in Victoria next year. Of course, they wanted to know when it might happen in Queensland. Once the complicated tendering process for the sale at Greenslopes is completed, I am sure they will not have long to wait. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is one area that members of parliament are often confronted with. The changes to the hospital treatment for veterans have meant that a very good friend of mine, Mr Bill Langford&mdash;I am sure he would not mind my mentioning his name in this place&mdash;who lives in a town called Laidley, which is some 45 minutes drive west of Ipswich, is now able to go to hospitals in Ipswich rather than having to go down to Greenslopes in Brisbane. He gets first-class service in Ipswich. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He often goes to one of the private hospitals, St Andrews. This means that his wife can visit him. When he had to go to Greenslopes she had to make the long trip by train to Brisbane and then she had to get a bus to Greenslopes. As the minister knows the area, he would understand the length of time it would take Mrs Langford to visit Bill at Greenslopes. So Bill Langford is one veteran who speaks very highly of those changes as they have assisted him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the measures in this legislation that we are debating today is the establishment of the income support supplement which will be paid from March next year. This change will affect those war widows and widowers who, in addition to their war widows or widowers pension, are currently also receiving additional income support payments from the Department of Social Security. Until now, widows and widowers have had to claim this pension through DSS, but under these new plans they will be able to get this payment in the form of the ISS directly through the Department of Veterans' Affairs. This will no doubt make life a lot easier for recipients of the supplement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ISS will be paid at the same rate as their social security payment, and veterans entitled to the payment who wish to continue to receive their payment through DSS will be able to elect to do so. This initiative has been warmly received by the ex-service community in general and by the War Widows Guild in particular. It is estimated that nearly 54,000 war widows and widowers will elect to transfer their payments from DSS to Veterans' Affairs, and I am sure life will be a lot easier for them as a result of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is indicative of the government's continuing commitment to the welfare of veterans and their dependants. One aspect of this commitment is reflected in the legislative amendments in this bill that seek to change the eligibility criteria for intermediate rate pensions, otherwise known as TPI pensions, in order to ensure that pensions are granted in accordance with their original intention. This amendment has been recommended by the Ministerial Advisory Council on Veterans' Issues and that council, headed by Justice Muirhead, includes representatives of the major ex-service organisations. This decision has been arrived at after extensive consultations with those people who are affected by the change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Special rate pensions were originally designed for severely disabled veterans of a relatively young age who would never hope to support themselves or their families or put sufficient funds away for their future needs. Similarly, the intermediate rate of pension was designed for the veterans whose war related conditions would limit their maximum possible working week to 20 hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes proposed in this bill will mean that these pensions will not be normally granted to veterans over 65, but exemptions to this rule will apply if the veteran was engaged in work after the age of 65 and that work was in the same business in which he or she had been working for at least 10 consecutive years. These new rules will apply only to veterans who claim special intermediate rate pensions after they have turned 65. Currently, existing special and intermediate rate pensions will not be affected by this change, nor will the condition where special or intermediate rate pensions will continue to be paid after the age of 65 provided the pension was granted to the veteran before the age of 65. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the amount of time remaining I would briefly like to touch on a few other points. I am, of course, aware of the time and I know that other members wish to make a contribution, and I assume that the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) will be speaking as well. However, there are a whole range of points that I am sure were covered earlier by other speakers. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs also covered a whole range of items in his speech that are of assistance in this particular bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year, in its policy launch for the supposedly unwinnable 1993 federal election, the ALP made a number of election commitments to senior citizens. It canvassed a number of policy initiatives, including a retirement incomes policy and a strategy of aged care. These policies included a whole range of specific commitments, such as the introduction of a seniors health card, an easing of the assets test for low income non-pensioner retirees and the introduction of a provisional age pension for long-term unemployed aged 60 and over. These commitments were costed at around $390 million over the period to fiscal year 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an enormous commitment to the welfare of older Australians and veterans in particular. In this legislation we are debating today, the government is showing that it has delivered on those election commitments. As I said at the beginning, there are few more important groups of people in this country than our veterans. The selflessness and courage they displayed when their country needed them demands respect from the rest of the population and from the law-makers of this country. I know that members on both sides of the House always support that view. I am very glad indeed to be able to support this legislation today and to say that it goes some way towards repaying this debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spoke earlier of the younger veterans who will benefit from the budget package. They, perhaps more than others, had a cause for some grievance in the past. For too long they were regarded as pariahs and not given the respect they deserved. As a result, many have endured very great problems, both physical and social. Anyone who has seen some of the worst effects that the Vietnam war had on service men and women knows what I am talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad to say that this has changed and continues to change. The turning point, of course, was the dedication of the Vietnam War Memorial, not far from this place. Whilst these veterans are perhaps in a different category from others, all our veterans will benefit in one way or another from this legislation. For this reason, it is a pleasure to have been able to support this legislation today. I commend the bill to the House and congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs on the manner in which he is carrying out his duties. As I mentioned before, I also congratulate his predecessor, Senator Faulkner. </PARA>

As all previous speakers have indicated, this bill is covering the terribly important subject of veterans' affairs. The previous two speakers have both acknowledged that there is not a more deserving group of people in our community than our veterans who, through a number of different conflicts overseas, have served this country extremely well. We should never lose sight of the fact that they did that without fear. A lot of the veterans have given up their lives in doing that, but many others have made a great sacrifice which has seriously affected their lives and the lives of their families through some of the disabilities that they suffer. My personal view is that we cannot apply the normal process of assessment to veterans. There must be more compassion involved, more flexibility involved, than is being laid out in one part of this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I join with the previous speaker, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), in acknowledging the work that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) has done in a number of different areas in putting this bill together, but certainly it has the government's trade mark on it in that it is an omnibus bill which the coalition is prepared to support, apart from one section. From time to time the government has presented bills of this nature to this House, knowing that there might be one area that the opposition is going to oppose while fully supporting all other sections of the bill. I would like to make particular reference in that regard to the changes that are being made for merchant mariners. I do not think there would be a person in this parliament who would be prepared to speak against that particular proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes several amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 and covers a wide variety of issues affecting veterans. The bill amends the principal act to establish a specialist tribunal, the Repatriation Medical Authority, to deal with medical-scientific issues relevant to claims for pensions as a result of disease or injury. It modifies the eligibility criteria for claims for special and intermediate rate pensions, abolishes the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act 1940 to bring veteran mariners under the auspices of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, and encourages veterans to claim any foreign pension for which they may be eligible. It modifies the payment of partner service pensions, and transfers the payment of income support payments for war widows and widowers under the Social Security Act to the Veterans' Entitlements Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I stated a while ago, it is obviously an omnibus bill. The coalition supports all those measures apart from the way that the government is dealing with the establishment of the Repatriation Medical Authority. We support what the government is trying to do for veterans. We support what the government is doing for those merchant mariners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 11 of the bill inserts a new part into the principal act to establish the Repatriation Medical Authority and outline its powers and functions proposed under section 196A. It establishes the RMA as a body corporate with perpetual succession and the power to sue and be sued. Proposed section 196B gives the RMA the power to determine a statement of principles in relation to a kind of injury, disease or death, setting out minimum factors which must be related to service rendered by a person to constitute a reasonable hypothesis for the purposes of the principal act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just stop there for a moment. In my mind that is too rigid. There is not enough flexibility in there. Each case is absolutely different. You cannot have a fixed set of guidelines and say that you either measure up or you do not. I do not think that is fair and I do not think that at the stage a lot of these veterans are at in applying for repatriation benefits they should be put over those sorts of hurdles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The RMA also has the power to review the contents of statements of principles as a result of requests under proposed section 196E. Proposed section 196C prohibits the RMA from carrying out any new research work for the purposes of an investigation but enables it to request information from the department or request the department to carry out research to confirm or disprove information about the type of injury, disease or death. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed section 196D makes determinations made by the RMA disallowable instruments, which is one positive point. Proposed section 196E allows claimants, the Repatriation Commission or veterans lobby groups to request the carrying out of an investigation under proposed section 196B. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed section 196F allows claimants, the Repatriation Commission or veterans lobby groups or persons with relevant expertise to make a submission which does not deal with legal matters to the RMA relevant to the investigation. Proposed sections 196K through to 196T are administrative and deal with membership of the RMA and remuneration, tenure, resignation, termination, allowances of members, along with the conduct and procedure of the meetings of the RMA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental issue in this legislation relates to the standard of proof necessary to establish that more recently acquired medical disabilities of veterans were caused by their wartime experience. The Baume report criticised the present criteria for operational service which is the reverse criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt linked to a reasonable hypothesis test. It recommended the civil standard with the benefit of doubt in favour of the veteran with operational service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has decided to retain the present beyond reasonable doubt provision but implement a Repatriation Medical Authority to determine principles of medical causation. The authority will be an independent body consisting of five eminent medical specialists and will prepare statements of principles based on sound medical-scientific evidence that will exclusively state what factors related to service must exist to establish a causal connection between particular diseases, injuries or death in service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement of principles will be a disallowable legislative instrument that will be binding on the Repatriation Commission, the Veterans' Review Board and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Whilst it is sensible to provide qualified scientific opinion to assist the various lay tribunals that have adjudicated in this arena to date, there is concern as to the inflexibility that could result from the systems proposed in the legislation as it will apply in the resolution of individual cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, there does not appear to be any process whereby a lay tribunal might submit an individual case to the authority for assessment. The whole process appears top down. Once a principle is established, all veterans must be judged against this standard&mdash;as opposed to a process of taking each individual case on its merits&mdash;and it eliminates any room for compassion in the assessment of an application. That is what the opposition is opposing as far as this particular aspect of the bill is concerned: its lack of flexibility and its inability to treat an individual case on its merits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all see this happening in our electorates. I am sure that every honourable member who has a large population of veterans living in his or her electorate has been asked by some of them to make representations to the minister over some grievance about their treatment by the Department of Veterans' Affairs in one way or another. Sometimes they are justifiable grievances and sometimes they are not, but the fact remains that those people have a right&mdash;and, some would argue, a greater right than a lot of other taxpayers in this country&mdash;to ask for some extra special consideration in view of what they have been through on behalf of their nation and in view of the free existence enjoyed by others in this country because of the efforts of those veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make it abundantly clear to the government that there needs to be more flexibility in that aspect of the legislation. We need to be able to deal with individual cases on their merits, thus providing more compassion in the assessment process, so that veterans who really do not want to go through the hassles of paper warfare with departmental officers do not have to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs is a very compassionate man because it is evidenced in some of the changes that he has quickly introduced to this act on taking on this portfolio. But the minister is not the only one who will be dealing with individual cases. Professional public servants will be doing their job as far as the rules and regulations are concerned. We need to be treating veterans as special and a little different from other sections of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the minister to seriously consider these comments in dealing with that area in the final stages of this bill. If I knew that the minister himself was going to be dealing with each individual case, I could be sure that this would be done properly, because he has a great understanding of the portfolio and a great deal of compassion. But that is not going to be the case. They are my concerns in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note the estimated savings to the Commonwealth in that measure in the bill: in 1994-95 they amount to $0.546 million; in 1995-96 they will be $4.119 million, and they continue to increase. I suppose that is only an actuarial exercise, because we do not know how long we are going to have a lot of our veterans with us. Certainly, in the initial year, half a million dollars in the overall scheme of things in Australia is not a lot of money when we consider some of the expenditures that we have coming out of budget each year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move to another aspect of this bill, the changes to the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act 1940. I have made a number of representations on behalf of my constituents to the responsible minister. These people contacted me almost straight after the federal election last year. They have been arguing their own case virtually since the Second World War. The names of a couple of those people are Charles Cheeseman of Lake Cathie and Phillip Lusher of Forster, who have carried the banner on this issue, along with the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), who has been a great advocate for merchant mariners in relation to this aspect of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge the work of the honourable member for Shortland. I think he has taken a very positive approach. I note the argument that merchant mariners have used over the last couple of years in their representations to change this act: that the Canadian government repealed its equivalent act some years ago to recognise the service of merchant mariners. So we will see some changes to the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act of 1940 is the major piece of legislation dealing with benefits for veteran mariners. The SWPA provides for the payment of pensions and gratuities in respect of death or incapacity incurred in the course of employment as an Australian mariner, defined in section 3(1). The eligibility criteria for a pension under this act are stricter than under the principal act, requiring the incapacity or death to be a direct result of the employment under section 12. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill transfers responsibility for pensions under the SWPA from the act to the principal act. Clause 47 repeals the SWPA, and clauses 48 to 68 are transitional provisions which preserve payments under the SWPA or its regulations, preserve claims and determinations currently on foot, and treat determinations under the SWPA or its regulations as equivalent under the principal act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, an Australian mariner is defined in section 5C(1) of the principal act, but benefits under the principal act are restricted to claims under part III of the principal act, which concerns service pensions. So at last, after all these years, we will see Australia's World War II merchant mariners recognised for the service that they gave to this country during that conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have talked to a lot of service people, and they will readily admit that a lot of Australia's merchant mariners during World War II saw more active service and were fired upon more than were a lot of the regular service personnel. In fact, their ships were often sunk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This change has been a long time coming. I would be the first to admit that the Second World War Australian merchant mariners have lobbied consecutive governments of both political persuasions. Again, I acknowledge the minister for bringing about this welcome change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, compensation benefits for mariners are more stringent than for veterans, in particular, the section on the connection required between employment and injury and on standard of proof. This will mean that for mariners who have rendered operational service there need be only reasonable hypothesis linking injury, disease or death to war service&mdash;the same as for veterans. It brings the provisions into line with those in the Veterans' Entitlements Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, the financial impact to the Commonwealth in the first 12 months in the 1994-95 year will be $2.274 million. That will go up to $3.066 million in 1995-96&mdash;a small price to pay for their service for our country. They were not in uniform, but they served their country in just the same way. They put their lives on the line for this country. A lot of these merchant mariners saw action closer to Australia than did a lot of the regular service personnel. So I commend the government for the part of this omnibus bill that will recognise those merchant mariners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that, when this was announced in the budgetary measures by the minister, those people on whose behalf I had been making representations were extremely pleased and relieved that at last their service during the Second World War was to be recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will move on to acknowledge another change in the budget which will give greater recognition to a lot of the very real&mdash;not apparent&mdash;problems being faced today by Vietnam veterans. I happen to have a Vietnam veterans association in my electorate that is very strong in numbers and voice. That association has close liaisons with Dr Len Lambert. Dr Lambert has presented a report to the government. I had the opportunity to meet with Dr Lambert before that report was released. I note the government's allocation in the budget of $20.6 million to the study of the post-traumatic stress disorder and its greater recognition of some of the problems that Vietnam veterans and their families are facing 20 or 30 years down the track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is terribly important&mdash;not so much in a financial sense but in a psychological sense&mdash;for those veterans to know that at last the people of the Australia, the Commonwealth of Australia and the parliament of Australia are seriously considering some of the problems and disorders that they suffer. They served this country in good faith in an overseas conflict. Whether we agree with that or not does not matter and whether we agree with the way some veterans were conscripted and some were regulars does not matter, they still served this country to the best of their ability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of Vietnam veterans in Australia are suffering from some very serious psychological and physical problems. We cannot ignore that section of our community. I commend the minister for the action he has taken in this budget to address this issue. I am sure many Vietnam veterans in my electorate would wish me to express that view. Personally, I would like to see the funding go a bit further but I know that there are economic and budgetary constraints on the expenditure of capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an ongoing problem that the Commonwealth has to be prepared to face up to. I believe that we are heading in the right direction. I ask the minister to seriously consider the implications that may arise when veterans claim repatriation benefits from the Repatriation Medical Authority. I am sure the minister will give the matter serious consideration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) for the Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill and for the measures contained in the budget. I am sure it was a difficult task. This bill contains some very good measures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last weekend, on behalf of the minister I visited a bush retreat for Vietnam veterans in the highlands of Tasmania, which is in my electorate. The government, through the joint venture scheme, assisted the veterans in replacing a generator which had been playing up for a long time. The generator was old, hard to start and had to be constantly filled with petrol. The wives of veterans, war widows and people who have mobility difficulties will now be able to utilise the retreat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This scheme has proved to be a great asset in that it has allowed access to that area to a wider section of the veterans community. After speaking to about 70 people who were at the retreat to celebrate the purchase of the new generator, I certainly felt that we had spent that money well. This scheme has been very successful in the past and I am sure it will be very successful in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mood of Australians has changed considerably. We are beginning to understand the difficulties our recent veterans have been through. The feeling is that we must extend to them the same care and services as we have extended to the veterans of all our other conflicts in the past. This government is looking at a whole spectrum of services for veterans. One of the new services which is a part of this bill is the establishment of a national centre for war related post-traumatic stress disorder. The centre will coordinate the development of a comprehensive scheme of accredited programs for the assessment, treatment and rehabilitation of veterans with PTSD. This involves private and public facilities in each state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assessment service will determine which type of program is most appropriate for each veteran. These programs include individual and group therapy, traumatic focus groups, anger management, alcohol and drug dependency, family therapy and adjustment skills. Once established, veterans will be referred for local support and in most cases will be managed by the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service. This service, coupled with some of the funding programs such as the joint venture, can offer the chance for Vietnam veterans to lead  fuller and more peaceful lives and discover freedom from the destructive legacies of the dramatic trauma of war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another highlight was the expanded health programs for our veterans, widows and widowers, who will now receive their pension and disability allowance from the Department of Veterans' Affairs rather than from the Department of Social Security. Our veterans associations will be very pleased that has occurred. The minister should be praised for achieving that goal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These initiatives contained in the budget have been carefully developed to address the most pressing needs of ex-service men and women, war widows and widowers, and their dependants. Also the budget looked at the longstanding and long overdue issue of bringing the merchant mariners under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Let me pay tribute, as the last speaker, the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) did, to the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) for the amount of work he has done over many years in championing this cause. The merchant mariners, along with the many other merchant mariners who served during our conflicts, have finally got more recognition&mdash;recognition that they deserve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initiatives in this bill form the basis of planning and administrative structures that will be in place for many years to come. We should always remember that we owe a big debt to our veterans and to those who never came back. The lives of the families of our veterans in many cases have been changed completely in their service of their country. This is a debt owed; it should never be forgotten or ignored. I support the bill. </PARA>

I also acknowledge and appreciate the very kind thoughts of the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the support of the opposition, via its shadow spokesman, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), for the broad thrust of this bill. I say from the outset that I am particularly sensitive to the fact that, in my view, all members of this House want to do the right thing by the veteran community. I do not think any members in this House would say that they have a mortgage on their feelings for those who put their lives on the line for the purposes of protecting the freedom and the democratic institutions of this country. There will always be those who want to review programs of governments of whatever political persuasion. This has been the case in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been said about the Repatriation Medical Authority. I want to make it extremely clear to all members of this House, including the opposition spokesman on these matters, that it is not my intention or the government's intention to in any way curtail legitimate claims of our veterans when they make an application for a disability pension as a result of war caused injuries. It is far from my intention to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Towards the end of 1992, the Commonwealth Auditor-General&mdash;and he can hardly be said to be a friend of this government or the parliament, as he is independent; my understanding is that he cannot be sacked unless both houses of parliament decide to do so&mdash;came out with a report which was highly critical of the way in which we pay our repatriation benefits. He said, in effect, that it was too generous. It was not the government or the opposition that said that; it was the Auditor-General. As a result, the previous minister, Senator Faulkner, arranged to commission a compensation review committee headed by Professor Peter Baume, a former health minister in a previous government, and assisted by Air Vice Marshal Bomball from the services community and Ms Robyn Layton, a barrister from Adelaide. They came down with a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A fair go</EMPHASIS>, which has been mentioned on a number of occasions in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I consider the report to be very detailed and quite good, a lot of veterans out there in the community will tell you that it is anything but a fair go. This is mainly because the report recommended that we change the present standard of proof from the reasonable hypothesis test to a civil standard of proof. The government rejected most of the nasties, if you like, in that report. We probably only picked up the recommendation providing for the setting up of the Repatriation Medical Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make it very clear that this entire budget package is exactly that: a package. It is not a smart trick on behalf of the government to bring in an omnibus bill so that all of it has to be accepted. It is a package. It did not just happen overnight. It was not organised in my office or that of Senator Faulkner. There was extensive consultation with the ex-service community. When I say `extensive', I do not mean, as some honourable members have uncharitably said here today, that I or Senator Faulkner spoke to a few senior people in the ex-service community. It was quite the contrary. I know that Senator Faulkner met with ex-service organisations all around the country and that he gave them at least broad principles as to what he wanted to do. Senator Faulkner set up the Ministerial Advisory Committee on Veterans Issues, or MACVI, which advised him on these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In real terms, we have a package of measures which no-one in this House is arguing with, apart from the measure which provides for the setting up of the Repatriation Medical Authority. What concerns me is that, in their zeal, held sincerely no doubt, those opposite want to oppose the part of the bill which provides for the setting up of the Repatriation Medical Authority. In practical terms, this means that I cannot introduce the moneys that will go to seamen and the merchant mariners. I am bringing this bill in today so that I will be in time for the start-up date of 1 July 1994. It will allow merchant seamen to come under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. I will not be able to bring in the $20.6 million package over four years for the purposes of trying to look after our younger veterans, and I will not be able bring in the $8.9 million aged care package that I want to bring in over future years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole premise upon which I have based this package and upon which the previous minister, Senator Faulkner, has had extensive consultations with the rest of the ex-service community around Australia is that it is a package. Again, I accept that the opposition is being sincere in its belief that this Repatriation Medical Authority will create some sort of a monster which will in some way impact upon the benefits or entitlements of veterans. I want to ensure that that is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major point that is being brought up here is that there seems to be ostensibly no form of appeal from the Repatriation Medical Authority. I want to touch on this point because it is very important. We are talking about benefits to veterans, a start-up date of 1 July 1994 and an issue on which I want a bipartisan approach. It is not a question of whether the opposition or the government gets some credit for this; at the end of the day, it is a question of what we are going to give to our veteran community. Frankly, I do not care who gets the credit as long as they get the entitlements they deserve&mdash;entitlements which are in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Let me take the House through the situation with respect to the Repatriation Medical Authority. The fact is that statements of principles are already used by the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Repatriation Commission. Under this bill, I will appoint five eminent doctors who have been accepted not only by their own organisations, such as the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, but also generally by the ex-service community. Only last night I met with members of the national executive of the RSL. I said to them that I am more than happy to ensure that I put a line through any doctor who has appeared and given evidence against a veteran in any court in this country. I said that that is what I would be prepared to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this statement of principle comes out, it will get lodged here in this parliament as a disallowable instrument. That means that any ex-service organisation or anyone who feels aggrieved can come along and say, `We don't like that.' All they have to do is object to it and I have to pull it out. It is a disallowable instrument, so that means it can be pulled out. That is the position at the end of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appeal question concerns the opposition. I want to make a few points about it. The statements of principles will not be appealable to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal because they are legislative and not administrative in nature. Statements of principles will not deal with any individual's case or any particular hypothesis in isolation but will apply generally to all veterans setting out all the relevant causal factors for each kind of injury, disease or death. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to 1977, approximately 30 per cent of claims&mdash;perhaps a few more&mdash;were being accepted by the Repatriation Commission. It is now over 70 per cent. Certain decisions can easily result in the situation getting out of control. That is what the Auditor-General and the Baume committee were talking about. We need to ensure that these sorts of cases do not undermine the integrity of the repatriation system. As many people in the ex-service community say, we have to look after the needy, not the greedy; not those people who can only tell some sort of a spurious story and still get some sort of benefit because they might be able to get one doctor in 100 who is prepared to accept their case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I will give some examples of what we call maverick claims. The first example is a minor bump or accident on service leading to a tumour 40 years later. There is nothing to distinguish the bump or accident from any others that happened before, during or after service. The second example is working as a clerk during the war and getting eye strain such as would cause cataracts. A third example is the drinking of one or two cans of Coca-Cola for about three months being responsible for dental caries 40 years later. All the Repatriation Medical Authority is trying to ensure is that we preserve the integrity of the system and that we come down with a statement of principles based on sound scientific-medical evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even then, according to the bill, there is an opportunity for review and members of the ex-service community can object. I will repeat what was said by my colleague the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, I stress that the bill establishes a comprehensive system of review of the contents of statements of principle. Veterans, their dependants and organisations representing veterans or their dependants will be able to make submissions to the authority which will be considered in the process of formulating the statements of principle. They will also be able to request the authority to carry out investigations into the cause of any injury, disease or death for the purpose of making a statement of principle and to request a review of any of the statements of principle. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comprehensive provisions exist in the bill in relation to such matters, including provisions requiring the authority to give notice of any request for investigation and enabling access to information in documents considered by the authority in arriving at its determination.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me make it very clear: I am a compensation lawyer. That was my job before I entered into the parliament. I can tell the House that there are doctors who will always give people opinions that lean a certain way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me finish. We are talking about veterans. I usually accept the honourable member's interjections, but I will not in this case because I am trying to make a very valid point. When lawyers get involved in these matters, people always get lawyers who are sympathetic towards their case. It is always easy to find one doctor out of 100 who will go along with someone's particular case. All I am saying is that we have to get rid of that. There is no point in going to tribunals, laypeople or judges who really know nothing about medicine. We are trying to get an authority that can objectively do what it is supposed to do. We are trying to prevent the two per cent&mdash;maybe three per cent&mdash;of maverick cases from getting through. What is wrong with that?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I finalise by saying&mdash;I make this offer quite genuinely to my friend the honourable member for O'Connor&mdash;that I accept his good intentions on this matter. As I said, I just want to be sure that, at the end of the day, this package goes through as was intended. I am giving back in their entirety to the veterans community the savings that have been mentioned of approximately $7 million over four years. I will give back every penny that we will save. It is not as though we are taking the money. If the honourable member can come up with a situation in which I am still able to put the Repatriation Medical Authority together and enable it to do what it is intended to do&mdash;that is, get rid of maverick claims&mdash;and if he can come up with some formula that does not in any way knock about the integrity of that authority, I am prepared to talk to him. At the end of the day, I just want to be sure that, come 1 July 1994, the merchant mariners can apply for their benefits and that all those moneys we are going to be spending on Vietnam veterans, et cetera, can be spent. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the honourable member for Lilley: the May labour force statistics released today do contain some excellent news for the nation. Employment increased by 30,500 in May. The number of people unemployed fell by 23,000. So the unemployment rate fell from 10.1 per cent in April to 9.8 per cent in May&mdash;the first time it has been below 10 per cent since August 1991. Employment is clearly growing quite strongly. Employment has increased by some 267,000 since April 1993. That is growth of 3 1/2 per cent in 13 months. Unemployment as a consequence is falling quite rapidly; it has fallen by 112,000 in the past seven months&mdash;from 11.1 per cent to 9.8 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also today the figures were released for the number of persons on jobstart and newstart allowances for May. They show a fall of 26,000, or a fall of 2.9 per cent&mdash;the biggest fall since January 1989. The number of long-term unemployed receiving newstart fell by 14,000, or 3.2 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are all very welcome statistics. They demonstrate that the benefits of strong economic growth are flowing through to the labour market. They demonstrate that quite unambiguously. They give the lie to the continuous opposition claim that we are not getting job growth. This was said in the opposition's formal reply to the budget. It has been repeated by various other opposition spokesmen and indeed stated again today by the opposition spokesman on employment, the honourable member for Goldstein. According to the AAP report, he said, `The government has not created real jobs.' What is he talking about?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been growth in employment of 267,000 in the last 12 months and he is saying there has not been any growth in real jobs. There has just been no growth in the opposition's preparedness to face the facts and recognise that we do have an economic recovery; that economic recovery is flowing through and creating strong employment growth, falling unemployment levels, rising real incomes and rising living standards. The whole litany of argument that we are getting from the opposition about there being no flow through to the people of Australia is a total nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to the second part of the honourable member's question: we are clearly very well placed for further substantial improvement in the labour market because there is absolutely no reason to believe that we will not go on chalking up rates of economic growth over four per cent. The 4 1/2 per cent GDP growth figure for 1994-95 stands firm. I think it is generally agreed by commentators to be a reasonable forecast. We can expect it to remain at rates of 4 per cent or above or beyond that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With growth in employment of 260,000 in the last 13 months we are very well placed to achieve our election promise of 500,000 jobs in this term of office. We are already over halfway there in 13 months without the white paper policies, which are a major part of this year's budget, which will feed through and impact on the labour market in the next 12 months. It can certainly be expected that these policies will have some additional effect in reducing the unemployment levels over and above that which would come from normal economic growth and its impact on employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can also confidently assert that the budget time estimate of an unemployment rate of 9 1/2 per cent by June 1995 looks very capable of achievement. The government welcomes these figures. They are very good news for the nation. They are very good news not only in the outcome that they depict for May but also for what they portend for the future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;His own comments make it clear that he was criticising an inflow of foreign capital into this country. At the same time he was trying to say that there is a poor investment climate in this country and that is why the money is flowing out&mdash;that the reason Australian investors are not investing in Australia is that there is a poor investment climate. What mugs he must think these foreign investors are. They have the whole world to choose from, but they are deciding to invest in Australia. Why are they doing it? Because it is a lousy investment environment! You must think they are a bunch of screwballs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should be pleased that foreign investors see Australia as an appropriate place to invest and believe that Australia's economic prospects are such that it is worth putting a lot of equity capital into Australia. That is important. To the extent that they do that, we can cover the current account deficit without resort to debt. Presumably, from the opposition leader's comments, he does not like foreign debt; therefore, he should prefer equity to debt. So why is he criticising the equity inflow?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should also be pleased that we now have a sophisticated business community in this country able to envisage investment not just in Australia but also in other countries and is prepared to look for business opportunities elsewhere that will provide benefits to Australia.

The Leader of the Opposition's statement is making foreign investors query whether or not this is an appropriate place in which to invest. When investors see these sorts of headlines and that sort of reporting of the opposition leader's statements, what will they think about investing in this country? They are going to think twice or even three times about it and maybe go elsewhere. The Leader of the Opposition recognised that in 1989. At that time he was being honest with this House rather than playing crude politics like he is doing now. What this opposition leader is doing is what the products of elite schools do when they participate in rowing.

It did that; indeed it enhanced that program and produced a lower outcome projected for 1996-97 than had been previously the case. We are very conscious of the fact that it is important to reduce the deficit as a means of taking the pressure off the rest of the economy as the private sector gets going, and it is also important in terms of improving national savings.

Our regional strategy is about ensuring that we have the benefits of recovery and growth shared equitably around the metropolitan and non-metropolitan rural regions of Australia. The government will release guidelines for the $150 million regional development program in early July. This program, when combined with white paper initiatives, particularly the new work opportunities and the regional environment employment program, provides a package of integrated employment and economic development assistance to regions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To qualify, regions have to demonstrate that they can engage all the players, all the regional leaders, in a concerted effort. This is what the government is about in regional development. It is not about taking a top-down approach, but working in partnership with regions, involving people at the regional scale, to ensure that the creativity, initiative and leadership that are there in urban or non-metropolitan regions are mobilised so that the benefits of recovery are shared more equitably. Our strategy is enjoying strong support by regional leaders. The president of the New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures said recently:</PARA>

We have not sought to talk up the strategy as being one of massive dollars. But I believe those selective dollars will make a very significant impact. In the visits that I have made to about 15 different regions around Australia, I have been impressed at how well regions are coming together, how focused they are in terms of this strategy and how much they want to work in partnership with this government to ensure that the benefits of a very strong recovery, about which the Treasurer has spoken today, are equitably shared in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, as you can hear from the honourable member for O'Connor, there is a fair bit of interest in the question of Australia's international relations, particularly its entering into multilateral treaties. A number of opposition spokespeople over recent times have attempted to construct some sort of great international conspiracy which is seeing Australia lose its sovereignty and is bringing Australian independence to its knees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at a couple of the basic facts before we have a look at the threads of this great conspiracy theory. Firstly, one of the principal features of our constitution&mdash;indeed, one of the things which would have been in the minds of our founders&mdash;is that Australia should have one international voice. Clearly, our constitution gives the Commonwealth the power to enter into international arrangements. That is an executive action under section 61 of the constitution. Clearly, the external affairs power gives this parliament express power to make legislation in relation to treaties in international matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Effectively, the action of entering into a treaty rather than being an attack upon the sovereignty of this nation is an action of sovereignty of this nation. It is a sovereign choice of Australia to enter into such arrangements. In many ways the substance of treaties reinforces Australia's sovereignty. For instance, the maritime boundary agreements we have with France, the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia establish beyond doubt the areas in which Australia exercises its sovereignty. The Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation confirmed sovereignty which Australia has over air space over this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times we have seen opposition members getting very anxious about this issue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the High Court has long recognised the position of the Commonwealth and its powers in external affairs. In fact, in 1936, the High Court in the decision of the King v. Burgess, Ex parte Henry made some very important comments on the extent of the external affairs power. I will very quickly quote Chief Justice Latham:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth parliament was given power to legislate to give effect to international obligations binding on the Commonwealth or to protect national rights internationally obtained by the Commonwealth where the legislation was necessary or deemed to be desirable for this purpose. It will be seen therefore that the possible subjects of international agreements are infinitely various. It is, in my opinion, impossible to say that any subject is necessarily such that it could never properly be dealt with by an international agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>That was not the Tasmanian dams case; the High Court made that decision in 1936. The other interesting part is that entering into these international agreements is somehow ripping up the constitution and destroying the federal compact. That is an interesting contention, given that the constitution gives external affairs power to the Commonwealth and that the constitution establishes the High Court to interpret on the scope and extent of Commonwealth powers. It is interesting that somehow opposition members are able to construe this exercising of legitimate power, given by the constitution to the Commonwealth in this parliament, as destroying in the same terms the constitution and the federal compact.

He found that there were more than 24 different types of meetings and that, for the last five years, no agendas or minutes of any of these meetings have been kept. Given that the Auditor-General also found that in some cases it took up to four, five or six months to pay clients their initial payments instead of the eight weeks identified by the CSA as a usual period, does the minister regard this waste of resources as appropriate, and does he accept any responsibility for what has obviously become an utter shambles?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In April this year I announced a number of changes which will improve the functioning of the Child Support Agency. The first is to allow direct payments for stage one court order cases, which are those cases that the Child Support Agency had prior to 1989. Until April this year, if custodial parents were receiving social security benefits and were clients of the Child Support Agency, they could not arrange private payments. I have changed that. In the instance where we know that they are good payers&mdash;where the money is paid on time from the non-custodial parent to the custodial parent&mdash;they will now be able to opt out. That will mean a freeing-up of resources within the Child Support Agency for the more difficult cases.</PARA></TALK.START>

There has been continual muckraking for over a month around this House and in the Senate where my representative Senator Bolkus has been the subject of a barrage of questions loaded with smear and innuendo.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the seriousness with which I regard these matters, I accept that it is my responsibility, as justice minister, to assure the House&mdash;and I do so&mdash;that the government has not in any way been involved in political interference or any impropriety in relation to these matters. The matters relate to a state criminal investigation between the CJC and the Queensland police, codenamed `Operation Wallah'. There is no AFP investigation and no NCA investigation; there is no joint AFP-CJC-Queensland police investigation and no joint NCA-CJC-Queensland police investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existence of Operation Wallah came to the attention of the AFP because the AFP and the Queensland CJC have a memorandum of understanding which recognises that an effective attack on organised crime activity requires mutual cooperation between law enforcement agencies and recognises the need for both agencies to accept and undertake to advise, inform and consult in respect of investigations which may result from time to time in mutual assistance being provided. The AFP advises that it has been briefed by the CJC strictly in accordance with the secrecy provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1989, Queensland. The AFP advised me that no briefing that it has had from the CJC has disclosed the commission of any Commonwealth offence. With respect to the National Crime Authority, there are similar cooperative arrangements in place, and the National Crime Authority has advised me that it too has been briefed by the Queensland authorities in respect of this operation. Both the NCA and the AFP have advised that the information provided to them by the CJC has not warranted their investigation. There are no Commonwealth investigations on foot and there has been no political interference. Operational matters regarding exchange of information between the AFP, the National Crime Authority and the Queensland CJC or police have been left entirely in the hands of the two Commonwealth agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the allegations raised in the House by the honourable member for Kennedy.

They are usually just asking for general information; that is, how much can I expect from my child support payment this month and when is it going to come? The voice messaging system trial in Perth has undergone an independent evaluation and we are going to implement that next year. From next year we are going to free up the phones because all of those calls can be made 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to the voice messaging system.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RJ4">Mr TICKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Leichhardt and acknowledge his service to Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders in that electorate. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs is an area where there has been traditionally a large measure of cross-party cooperation between the government and the opposition. I acknowledge at this point in my answer that we do have that cross-party cooperation in support of the reconciliation process, in support of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and in support of the implementation of the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I must say that I am very concerned about this morning's report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> where the Leader of the Opposition is quoted as committing the opposition to repeal the Native Title Act should the opposition be elected to govern this country, and also to express opposition for the establishment of the national Aboriginal land fund. This is an area of public policy where potential leaders of this country I think are judged and measured by their commitment to take a stand in support of the rights of the indigenous people of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the opposition that, in this area of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, there would be nothing more damaging to the process of reconciliation and more damaging to Australia's international reputation than repealing the Native Title Act. I stand with the views of the former President of the Western Australian Liberal Party and the former Liberal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Ian Viner. He is on the public record as calling for the opposition to take a stand to support the Native Title Act. Mr Viner says, and I say, that there ought to be a recognition of human rights before states rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the question of the proposed land fund, I was very pleased, as was the Prime Minister, to see that when the new shadow minister, the honourable member for Hindmarsh, first spoke to the media on the day following her appointment, she acknowledged, `Mr Downer appointed me to the position and he is certainly aware of my moderate views on the subject of the land fund.' On the public record after her appointment she supported the establishment of that fund. Within 24 hours, the Leader of the Opposition had issued a directive to the shadow minister to take an about-turn and to come into line in opposition to that fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no mere accident that those members of the coalition who are known to take a more progressive or moderate stand in Aboriginal affairs&mdash;such as the honourable member for Aston, the honourable member for Tangney, the honourable member for Bradfield and, on the front bench, the honourable member for Chisholm&mdash;are those who have been relegated either to the far back bench or to the very outer of the coalition front bench. I regret to say that what we now see from the coalition is a very hardline policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me tell the House what Mr Fred Chaney, another former Liberal minister, said only one month ago:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you go back through Liberal history and look at the writings of a great conservative statesman like Sir Paul Hasluck, it is pretty clear that, within the Liberal Party, there has always been a need to show a bit of leadership and to stand up for those interests who would really give the Aboriginal people nothing.</PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion, I challenge the opposition to look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 1974. In 1974, this parliament voted unanimously to establish an Aboriginal land fund. The first speaker for the coalition was John Hyde. He was also supported by the predecessor to the now Deputy Leader of the National Party. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say this to the Leader of the Opposition: if you want to be seen as an alternative leader in this country, you must turn your back on policies that have the effect of literally tearing up the constitution and the commitment and responsibility of this parliament to enact laws to defend the human rights of indigenous people.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Speaker, for the opportunity to address this matter. I am pleased that there are as many members on this side of the House to hear this discussion and disappointed that, in a situation in which we have seen this increasing disparity of wealth, members of the Australian Labor Party seem to think they should leave the House or have already done so. I particularly welcome the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) because he has had some things to say on this matter recently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I start by simply adverting to the fact that this government is one that has liked to parade itself as a party of social justice. It does so on many occasions, at quite considerable expense to the taxpayer, by producing documents like the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Social Justice Statement 1994-95</EMPHASIS>, which was tabled recently. It is a continuing practice of the government to parade itself as a party of social justice, concerned about the plight of the poor, the unemployed and those who are increasingly disadvantaged in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party's interest in these matters is largely a myth. The government's record on these matters is going to hang around its neck like an albatross for a long time to come. It is an albatross that comes in the form of income disparity, despite Labor's claims. There has been an increasing inequity in the distribution of earnings of full-time adult employees and it has occurred all of the time this government has been in power. In short, the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taking into account inflation, the top 10 per cent of earners in Australia have seen their incomes rise by seven per cent since Labor took office. Over the same time, real wages for the bottom 10 per cent of earners have fallen by five per cent. It is the policies of the Labor Party, notwithstanding the minister's suggestion that it is some other events or circumstances, that have caused this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will put some figures before the House because I think they are important. These figures were produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and show that the lowest 10 per cent of earners in 1981-82 were earning $9,376 on average, but in 1989-90 that had fallen to $9,010. The highest income earners, the top 10 per cent, earned $61,394 in 1981-82 and in 1989-90 earned $64,910. Nothing could more graphically demonstrate that distribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to rely on those figures necessarily or on the assertions that I make. I want to draw upon the comments of those in whom I think the government places great store. Professor Peter Saunders is the Director of the Social Policy Research Centre at the University of New South Wales. That centre is funded by the government to provide information to and conduct research for the government on social policy issues. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Often favourably, but I do not know that the government would want to quote this. In 1990 Professor Saunders said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is amongst the most unequal of the countries studied . . . despite many claims to the contrary. Australia's wage system, selective income tested social security system, and heavy reliance on progressive income tax have not, in fact, produced a more equal distribution of income than elsewhere. This naturally leads to the central question of why this is the case . . . one that poses a fundamental challenge for those who view Australia as an egalitarian country.</PARA>
<PARA>Recently&mdash;it would have done the minister well if he had been there&mdash;the Parliamentary Library held a vital issues seminar for members. A number of people addressed it. Julian Disney was one and another was Professor Helen Hughes. She has worked extensively in the area of trade and development and is, I know, highly regarded by the government. In fact, former foreign minister Hayden used her report for substantial changes that he made in the way in which development fundings were occasioned. These comments were made on 1 June. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we are creating an underclass but it is not an underclass of its own making it is being created by the way which we run this economy . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know that you could find any more damning quote than that, but I thought the second point she made was equally interesting. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second point I want to make is the Green Papers and the White Papers&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>papers on unemployment recently produced by the government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">are not about employment they are about making unemployment palatable to the community and all I can say is that if we follow the policies of those papers then next time we have a recession unemployment will be who knows 12-14% or perhaps if we are a republic, we may be like the republic of Ireland where it is 15-16% because there is nothing in those papers that is real medicine it is as if the patient has TB and the papers are about bandages.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether anyone could produce a more damning quote than that. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who is overseas at the moment, commented today about Australia. I do not know whether he addressed these matters. I suspect he did not. The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sum result of the changes in Australia has been that we now see ourselves in a much larger mirror&mdash;a mirror which reflects the comparative advantages . . . and the comparative shortcomings which we must rectify.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1987 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those opposite talk about poverty. What credibility have they got to talk about poverty when the single greatest generator of poverty is unemployment . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I acknowledge that the figures today suggest that marginal improvements are occurring. We welcome those improvements. We do not talk this country down. We want to see an improvement. But what are we improving from? After 10 years of Labor in office, is it an improvement on the situation that we left, or is it an improvement on the situation that the government created? The fact is that unemployment has reached unparalleled heights under this government. If it needs to be put in terms that the minister and I understand, in 1981 Fred Chaney was concerned that unemployment benefits might rise to something of the order of $1 billion per year. In the 12 months to June 1993, total expenditure is now $7.5 billion a year.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Baldwin" NAMEID="MD4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr Baldwin</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are very real comparisons. There were much lower levels of unemployment under the government that left office at that time compared with the situation under this government. I think everyone in this chamber knows, if you look at the figures in percentage terms or real terms, that the government's record is damnable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad the minister is here. The other day he took the opportunity to answer a question from his own side. He is obviously sensitive to these matters. What he was trying to suggest was that the government, now sensitive to these matters with its friends in the ACTU, is funding studies to show that if the material upon which things are judged is changed&mdash;things such as the Henderson poverty line&mdash;and if new factors such as the social wage are introduced, it might be able to characterise them in a different way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has waxed lyrical about increases in the social wage. It is true that, if we look at some of those factors, which were, I think, in large part initiated by the Fraser government, particularly in the area of family support, we can see the changes that have been made. The minister is not even gracious enough to acknowledge that under former governments changes were made that were worth while and beneficial. The fact is that those changes were made. We recognise that there have been some improvements in relation to those matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real point that needs to be made about the social wage is that it is always the second best option to increased employment prospects. The effects of the social wage increases have been largely nullified by industrial relations constraints, tax inefficiencies and the like introduced by the Labor government. The results of this are sad but simple. The costs of employing people have been rising. We as a country are not saving or investing enough. The speech of Helen Hughes listed the fundamentals as to why we are not creating jobs in a way which would address the real question that faces this country. This government is not creating enough employment to erode the massive spectre of long-term unemployment in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go on with the figures&mdash;I have them all here&mdash;but I want to move on in the short time available to me to remind the House that a wealth of information is now available demonstrating what has happened in this country. Honourable members perhaps do not need to be reminded, but in 1987 Prime Minister Hawke said that by the end of 1990 no Australian child would be living in poverty. That claim, which emphasised Labor's lack of credibility, also demonstrated that the poverty that children endure is a major problem that continues to face this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Social Trends 1994</EMPHASIS> was published recently. It is a bit like ministers' statements of pecuniary interests. They are as scarce as hens' teeth; you cannot really get hold of them. I borrowed this from a journalist, because the government did not distribute them widely. It is a telling indictment of the government's record. The statistics reveal that over two million Australians are now living well below the poverty line. </PARA>

It is a fundamental resource which is available to us all and one which we all ought to be aware of. The report shows that over two million Australians are now living well below the poverty line&mdash;13 per cent of households, a rise of over 14 per cent since Labor came into office. This is the same Henderson poverty line that was first commissioned and developed by the Whitlam Labor government. It has long been accepted and now the government wants to put it in dispute.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am quoting from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Social Trends 1994</EMPHASIS>. The document reveals also that 44 per cent&mdash;almost half&mdash;of Australia's single parent families now live in poverty. That is an appalling indictment of this government. How has the government reacted to this increase? Essentially, it has tried to fudge the figures. That is what I think the minister will try to do later. He will say, `We have had someone doing a special study and they have said that there are other factors that now ought to be taken into account.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These bad social statistics should not be used as a way of trying to fudge the issue. They ought to be seen as the signal for the government to change its policies to put in place the sorts of programs that will create real employment. I think the Prime Minister was right. I think employment is the key. The government has, on its own record, produced record levels of unemployment. When unemployment figures have remained high, we have largely seen from this government the creation of programs designed to ameliorate, or, in the terms of Helen Hughes, the creation of bandages and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Inequity is an important question. Other studies have dealt with this matter. Phillip Raskall from the University of New South Wales revealed that during the period from 1979 to 1989 the taxable income share of the bottom 20 per cent of Australian society declined from 9.1 per cent to seven per cent, whereas the taxable income of the top 20 per cent increased its share from 36 per cent to over 40 per cent. These are clear statistics that reveal the government's lamentable record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, we will not let the government off the hook in relation to these matters. We will continue to remind the government of its failure. We will remind it that these publications and papers are no excuse. We will ensure that this record of failure is one that hangs around its neck like an albatross. Unfortunately, it is a dead, rotting albatross, and the stench will follow the government until it leaves office. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This would have to be one of the most extraordinary displays of hypocrisy we have seen in recent times. The honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) referred to the emergence of an underclass. The reality is that the only factor that could have led to the emergence of a genuine underclass of the kind that we see in the United States&mdash;if that term has any meaning&mdash;is the policies that the opposition espoused in Fightback. Under the opposition's policies people would have been thrown off benefits after nine months and forced to fend for themselves, there would have been huge cuts in social expenditure and the introduction of highly regressive taxation changes.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not surprising. That is the reality. Let us compare the performance of the government with that of the opposition. Let us look at the Fraser years of government compared with Labor's period of government. During the 1980s throughout the entire developed world there has emerged a growing disparity in earnings differentials. That is true. This phenomenon has occurred in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Canada and West Germany. It is a common phenomenon and most analysts attribute that to underlying changes in the structure of the labour market, the impact of globalisation and the fact that most developed economies and a whole range of manufacturing areas are now competing in an environment where developing countries are increasingly active, the Cold War has ended and technology has changed. It is true that we have seen changes of that kind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relevant question to ask is: what is the impact of government policy? During this government's term in office we have made major improvements in the social security safety net, which is the primary means by which we protect people from becoming what might reasonably be described as an underclass. Let us have a look at that safety net and compare our performance with that of the opposition. During the Fraser years the real level of pension for pensioner couples fell by two per cent in real terms. Under this government the real level of basic pension has increased 15 per cent. If we take into account enhanced rent assistance, the real rate has increased for single pensioners by 24 per cent and for couples by 31 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the Fraser years the real rate of payment to sole parents with two children in rented accommodation fell by four per cent. Under this government, with the improvements in rent assistance, basic payments and family payments, the real rate of payment has increased by 37 per cent. During the Fraser period the rate of unemployment benefit for a single unemployed person fell by 19 per cent in real terms. Under this government, with the rent assistance improvements, it is up 57 per cent. I could go on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) made reference to the fact that the Fraser government introduced the FIS payment. That is true, but it had an appallingly low take-up rate and there was no rent assistance for working families. Under this government we have upgraded and substantially improved family payments targeted to low income earners&mdash;those in the social security system and those earning low wages. The rate of additional family payment has gone up by 80 per cent in real terms for children under the age of 13 and 150 per cent in real terms for children aged between 13 and 15. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we relate the incomes of people at the bottom of the earnings scale in our society to the Henderson poverty line, particularly those who are primarily dependent on the social security system, we find that all the payments have been improved substantially. In 1983 no sole parent, unemployed person or family in rented accommodation received a social security benefit above the poverty line. Now the great majority do. For example, in 1983 the payment for a sole parent with two children in rented accommodation was nine per cent below the poverty line. Now it is four per cent above the poverty line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is simply no doubt that this government has made major improvements in the adequacy of the basic social security safety net. We have moved the great bulk of people above the Henderson poverty line. People who are not totally dependent on social security are those who have some significant additional earnings and are obviously in a better position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Berowra opened his contribution with the claim that the poor are getting poorer. That is demonstrably untrue. It is a demonstrably true statement about the period when those opposite were in office. Under Fraser all the payments I referred to previously were down significantly in real terms. Under this government the very reverse is the case&mdash;they are up significantly in real terms. If we are going to make these comparisons, there has to be some modicum of intellectual honesty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Berowra talked about the unemployment rate. It is true that dealing with unemployment is the single most important way of addressing unemployment. To the great embarrassment and consternation of the opposition, it is the case that we are showing great improvements in the employment situation at the moment. The honourable member for Berowra talked about there being some marginal improvement. If he counts 263,000 extra jobs in the space of 13 months as a marginal improvement, then he has a very peculiar definition of that term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are seeing a robust recovery and it is flowing through into jobs. In addition to creating the conditions for that to occur, we are making sure that the long-term unemployed do not get left behind. We have overhauled the social security system to remove disincentives to participation in work and disincentives to people maximising their casual or part-time work if they are in that situation or taking up a full-time opportunity if that becomes available. The job compact is designed to ensure that the long-term unemployed receive substantially increased assistance, designed to make sure that they do not get left behind as the process of economic recovery develops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is in stark contrast once again to the position of the coalition. Its Fightback policy would have slashed labour market program assistance which is crucial to the long-term unemployed. The evidence is absolutely clear that, without labour market program assistance, training, wage subsidies and other forms of assistance, people who have been out of work for 12 months or more have very poor prospects of finding work. If we provide that assistance it does not guarantee that they will get a permanent job but their chances of getting one are immensely increased. That is a key equity issue. With Fightback the coalition would have cut those programs to ribbons. For those opposite to come in here and say that they are concerned to ensure that unemployment generated poverty is dealt with adequately is again utter hypocrisy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this country, as in most developed countries, there has been some increase in earnings disparities. It has to be taken into account, however, that when talking about inequality you cannot just talk about cash earnings. You have to take into account the impact of the transfer payments provided through the social security system, the changes in the tax system and, crucially, the changes in the social wage&mdash;things like the introduction of Medicare, the great expansion in child care and so forth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is particularly important in our case because over the life of this government we have had an explicit trade-off between money wage increases and social wage provision. There has been a slower than might otherwise have been the case increase in money wages precisely because of the understanding through the accord that the government has with the trade union movement to raise the social wage. It is particularly misleading in that context to try to do an analysis of trends in inequality that fail to take those factors into consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also utterly misleading in trying to achieve some international comparison to not look at all those different factors that go to make up living standards and meaningful measures of inequality. There are no international studies that bring into play all those relevant considerations I referred to, such as cash incomes, social security payments, tax changes and social wage measures. It is very difficult to make those sorts of international comparisons. However, there have been attempts to bring some of those factors to bear and they show a very different picture to the UN study that was referred to. They show that our performance is significantly better in terms of an international comparison of inequality. The UN study that the opposition has made reference to is virtually meaningless. It is simply based on published data which is derived in quite different ways in different countries. No serious analyst would suggest that that is a reasonable way of measuring differences in inequality between countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact of government policy over the course of the 1980s and early 1990s has been to reduce that underlying drift to higher differentiations in earnings that we share in common with other developed countries. That has been the object of careful study by Professor Anne Harding and others, who have stated that the impact of our changes to the tax system and the social security system have been to significantly ameliorate and offset those changes. So that is the effect of government policy. If we are going to make comparisons between what we are proposing to do and what the coalition is proposing to do, that is obviously the only appropriate way to look at it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make a few observations about coalition policy. As I said in answer to a question the other day, it is difficult to get any sensible information about what constructive policies the coalition may have in this area. Whole rainforests have been logged to produce press releases for the opposition spokesman on social security, but if one reads through them one finds that they are all carping, and in many cases quite silly, criticisms of government policy. There is an utter dearth of constructive policy proposals. So we do not know what sorts of policies the opposition spokesperson favours in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In talking about this matter we have to pay a bit of attention to what is coming from the opposition backbench. Some of the proposals are quite startling, like the one from the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) to ban marriage for a year. That was an interesting one in the area of family policy, but there are others. We have the Howard income splitting proposal. What effect would that have? It would mean that a family on $20,000 would have to pay $200 extra tax. A family with an income of over $100,000 would have an income tax reduction of $7,000 a year. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is; that is absolutely correct. Take the proposal from Senator Minchin, who thinks the right way to go is to aggregate all family and child-care payments, divide them up per head amongst children and distribute it on that basis. What effect would that have on a family on $20,000? It would mean that the assistance they would receive from the government would be reduced from $153 a week to $73 a week. What an equitable measure that would be! These coalition policies would really help the pattern of income distribution! <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the variation on that theme we had from the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), with his so-called family wage concept. Again, there is a minor difficulty with that proposal; it would cost $7 1/2 billion. That is a minor technical problem that somehow the opposition would manage to fudge over. But even with that level of expenditure, for a family on $20,000 with a couple of kids it would mean a reduction in their weekly income of $20 and a significant increase of $130 a week for the family earning over $100,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the party that is concerned about inequality and inequity. These are the sorts of policies which are bubbling to the surface. Who knows what the opposition will eventually do? We have no clue about that. The singular feature of the opposition to date is its failure to produce anything in the way of a coherent policy that one can analyse. That is its strategy&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. The opposition has no constructive policies whatsoever. The totality of the thrust of opposition policy is concerned about earnings distribution, yet it wants an industrial relations framework which would substantially eliminate or severely diminish the effectiveness of the system of award protection which protects low income earners. So how can the opposition possibly talk about and be concerned about earnings? In talking about inequality you have to look at a lot more than earnings; you have to look at all those factors. I have outlined the coalition's policy. It is appalling. It is utterly farcical for coalition members to come in here professing concern about these matters.

I am Australian and proud to be an Australian.

But I am concerned about the youngster who had no shoes. This is the situation we face in Australia today. Whether the minister likes it or not, there is a growing underclass. As members of parliament we hop in a plane to come to Canberra and have a car pick us up and bring us to the parliament.

But always we had the hope in our hearts that things were somehow going to be better. At least we could find a job. We could work hard and make things better. That is the way we wanted it to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today the minister was talking about the improvement in the unemployment figures. I am one person who welcomes that. In my electorate almost 200 people appear to have found jobs last month. That is wonderful, but we still should be ashamed of the disgraceful 9.8 per cent unemployment rate that afflicts the nation. We have an outrageous foreign debt and unemployment rate. With all of these things happening around us we seem to have accepted mediocrity; we believe that we just have to accept these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The underclass that has been created is causing great uncertainty for all people, and not only for those people who are there now. People are concerned even if they are working and earning a wage. Over the last several years the government has bragged that real income for workers has reduced or stayed stable. I am one person who believes that we cannot allow salaries to stay stable. We must have an industrial relations system that allows workers to earn more money through increased productivity. Today we have an industrial relations system so tied up and antiquated that people cannot work the way they want to work to earn more money to keep their families the way they would like to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia 40,000 families are expected to become homeless in 1994; 800,000 children live in homes where neither parent is employed, and 35 per cent of marriages end in divorce. It is a scandal, whichever way you look at it. We spend $3 billion a year on divorce, $2.87 billion a year on sole parent pensions, $10 million a year on youth homelessness and $1.64 billion on vandalism and property damage. The Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin), who is at the table, says that things are great, that we have the social wage. That would be wonderful, but what we really want is to have people in jobs, earning enough money to keep their families and to live in a manner which most Australians in an advanced Western democracy should expect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does this government do? I mentioned the industrial relations system, which holds people back from doing the things they want to do, from entering into agreements with their employers so that they can earn more money. There are simple little things that increase family costs like the price of leaded and unleaded fuel. We all know that something had to be done to reduce lead in the atmosphere, but why not reduce the price of unleaded fuel if you want to people to use more of it? But no, the government put a tax on both fuels so that those people who are lucky enough to have a car have to pay more money to get to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the government pretends to be a party that represents the workers and the underprivileged, it always seems to put more costs and burdens on them. As I said before, the government has said that real incomes have been kept low. Today I phoned around to ask different non-government welfare organisations what the situation is. They said, `Look, we have never been busier, despite the fact that we are hearing from the government that the economy is improving and that work is being found.' One gentleman told me that his work is skyrocketing. The number of people coming to him in need of welfare and assistance is disastrous. I said to him, `But you're not talking about people who don't want work.' He said, `No, most of those people who come into my office genuinely want work but they cannot find work.' He said that parents were ringing up and saying, `Look, can we come and get some money? We've sent Johnny off to school this morning without any food, but we really want to buy him some lunch.' We are talking about Australia; we are not talking about other countries. This is supposed to be a wealthy country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that families are under siege. I heard the minister today pooh-pooh some ideas that we in the coalition are putting forward to try to advance the welfare of families. We have not said that these are our policies, but at least we are having a go. We are putting forward different ideas. I particularly like the idea of a family wage being paid, as was put forward by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt about it: there is a disparity. The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. What really upsets me is that we always seem to take a bandaid approach, as the honourable member for Berowra said. We seem to be patching up. People do not want welfare. People want to be able to live in dignity, to be able to earn a wage and to care for their children. They do not want to have to receive all these handouts and bandaids. They want to be able to provide for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Different decisions made by the Keating government have made the situation even more unfair. The government has introduced schemes, such as the home child-care allowance, thinking that it is helping people, but it has disadvantaged other people, particularly those families where one parent is staying at home to raise the children. These things keep going on and on. I do not think governments really understand what they are doing when they give out all these handouts. They should study things very carefully and make sure that, by assisting one group, they are not making it more difficult for others. There is no justice in a policy which can provide $61.50 per week to a double-income household earning, say, $300,000 per year, but which can provide only $24.50 per week to families on $40,000 with one parent at home full time caring for children. </PARA>

I think that is where there is a real poverty gap. Those people who stay home to look after their children are disadvantaged. I could speak for hours about the disadvantages confronting many Australians today due to the policies of this government. Anything that we in the coalition can bring forward as a remedy to the situation must be welcomed by all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting to note that yet again the opposition is in negative mode: nothing positive could ever happen to Australia's families. We hear much-vaunted talking from those opposite about sole parent families and families without male role models. Given that the coalition parties want to get government off the backs of people, I simply pose the following question: what on earth would be the role of government in stopping divorce? Given the involvement of those opposite in the institutions of this country, most of which are male dominated, and given the fact that the people who walk away from marriages in this country are predominantly males, surely those opposite can then assert their power on their brothers to stay in marriages and face up to their responsibilities rather than having women bear the burden of child rearing, as occurs in this country. I find it somewhat ironic that the people who talk the most about families are of the same gender as those who walk away from their family responsibilities. So I ask those opposite to consider ways in which that problem may be reasonably addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) talk about a number of factors. The honourable member for Riverina (Mr Hicks) talked about his old school days and so on. I know members of the opposition are always happy to hark back to what they believe were the halcyon days of the 1950s and 1960s. I look back on those days too. The great bulk of us grew up in houses that had lino on the floor, a wood stove and a toilet down the back. There were no opportunities for girls to be educated. In Queensland, people did not go to high school unless they were extremely wealthy. University was out of the question, unless people won a scholarship or had very wealthy parents. Queensland had such a small number of tertiary places because nobody could afford to go to university, except for those of us who were lucky enough to win scholarships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the whole issue of Australian society and the way in which it operates, we also have to ask ourselves what income means and what it can buy. If we are going to be making comparisons with respect to income, we have to realise that income here in Australia means different things for different people. Age pensioners receive between $9,000 and $10,000 from the government, but some of them own their own homes and have no responsibilities for children. People earning $25,000 who perhaps are struggling to pay their mortgages and raise their children may find themselves somewhat disadvantaged as opposed to other people in the same bracket who have public housing or who have subsidised housing because of their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can also make comparisons with some of our Asian neighbours. Let us consider the wages required to live in one room in Tokyo. People have to take their beds down each night and wrap them up in the morning. They are forced to travel for between two and four hours each way to work&mdash;morning, noon and night. A set of clothing will cost in excess of $A1,000. These comparisons become just a nonsense. We are in very real danger of making these kinds of comparisons when we look at questions of income. We have to look at what money will buy and what we as a society believe are important and basic imperatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we all recognise that one person unemployed is one too many. But I also say to honourable members opposite, who fail to recognise this, that the size of the work force has grown by 1 1/2 million in the last 10 years. So we have considerably more people in work than we did 10 years ago. That is reflected in the number of women who are working, the number of young people who are working and the number of older people who are working. Generally, our work force is larger. That is a product of more people wanting to work and more people wanting to participate in the economic life of this country, and they have an entitlement to do so. What has generated part of our 9.8 per cent unemployment rate is the desire of huge sections of the community which previously were not involved in the economic life of this country to participate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Social Security talked about the social wage. I know that members of the opposition find this very difficult to adhere to. But I say to them again that it is only a Labor government that can bring about a social wage. We have heard the views of those opposite on Medicare. But to people with families, being able to access bulk-billing doctors and health care without requiring money is enormously important. It is a system which is the envy of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might digress for a moment and say that I, as a member of a parliamentary delegation and guest of the Japanese government, had to find cash money to attend what was in fact an emergency. The fact that representatives of the Australian government were there and that we had fistfuls of travellers cheques still meant nothing; access to Japan's medical system required cash down. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there are a number of other issues which very many Australians too often fail to appreciate: our clean air and clear water; our democratic rights&mdash;the right to vote, citizenship rights and so on; family payments, as the minister has outlined; and our basic social security system, which is one of the few in the world which is not insurance based. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we may deplore having children on the street&mdash;and I deplore that; any child on the street is one too many&mdash;I do not think the actions by Mr Major and his conservative government, the ideological cohorts of the people opposite, in rounding up the homeless beggars in London should be emulated; nor should we emulate the position in the United States of America where there are three million people on the streets on any one night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think those kinds of comparisons, if we were about to make them, are enormously important. I think another important issue that needs to be raised is access to education. A change has occurred in our retention rates&mdash;we now see the vast bulk, somewhere in the region of 80 to 90 per cent, of our young people being able to stay on at school till year 12. This has been made possible by a range of family payments and Austudy payments. We also see our young people being able to take up university and TAFE courses in the tertiary sector. Forty per cent of our young people are now able to take those courses up&mdash;a huge jump from the 10 per cent it was just a generation ago. I think all of those things are indicators of the fabric of Australian life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The stories we hear about the demands made on emergency relief and elsewhere are horrifying and demonstrate a crisis. In a meeting that I had with some people from the Salvation Army and from the St Vincent de Paul Society the issue of codependency was raised. It is now becoming a very real problem. We need to look at the levels of disposable income of many of those people who are now seeking emergency relief and ask ourselves whether codependency by the organisation is also at fault and whether we have not given people the opportunity and have not created the opportunities for them through our non-government organisations to become more independent. Labour market programs and a whole range of family services provided through neighbourhood centres, resource centres, family resource centres and area resource centres are all part of the government's work in providing for our families and for our society. While it is interesting to hear opposition members talk about the demands on families and the need to preserve our families, at the same time they would dismantle those kinds of structures, which they see as being simply financially based. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the House do not believe an underclass is being created.

As honourable members may be aware, the Goulburn Valley is the heart of Australia's deciduous canning fruit and tomato processing industry. Many of my constituents are employees of major fruit canning cooperatives&mdash;SPC in Shepparton and Ardmona Fruit Products in Mooroopna.

I wish to make a statement concerning alleged corruption in what was formerly the Food Preservers Union of Australia. I emphasise that the alleged corruption relates to events which occurred prior to the formation of the amalgamated union&mdash;the AFMEU&mdash;and that there is no suggestion of corruption in what was formerly the Automotive, Metals and Engineering Union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will outline some serious allegations concerning an alleged criminal conspiracy between the current federal and Victorian secretary of the food and confectionery division, Mr Tom Ryan; the assistant secretary of the Victorian food and confectionary division, Ms Gail Cotton; and a convicted criminal, Mr Gavin Anderson. Mr Anderson is currently serving a six-year gaol sentence for theft, which he committed while acting as an investment adviser in Victoria. It has been alleged that Ms Cotton invested $30,000 with Mr Anderson in 1988 and that Mr Anderson subsequently misappropriated those funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter has been on the public record since late 1989, when there were newspaper and television reports of Mr Anderson's misappropriation of Ms Cotton's funds. At the time, Mr Anderson was serving as a paid investment consultant to an occupational superannuation fund, the Food Industry Superannuation Trust&mdash;FIST. That trust was established in 1987 to receive moneys paid by employers in the food and confectionary industries for the benefit of workers who were members of the then Food Preservers Union of Australia and the then Confectionary Workers Union of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Ryan was at the time the general secretary of the Food Preservers Union of Australia. Mr Ryan was also the founding chairman of the Food Industry Superannuation Trust, and he continues to hold that position. It has been alleged that Mr Ryan, after discovering that Mr Anderson had misappropriated Ms Cotton's funds, made a criminal conspiracy with Mr Anderson and Ms Cotton to continue Mr Anderson's contract as a consultant to FIST without requiring Mr Anderson to carry out any work for FIST. The alleged conspiracy involved the payment of FIST members' moneys to Mr Anderson so that Mr Anderson could then pay moneys to Ms Cotton. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Anderson's finances were subject to the supervision of the Official Trustee from November 1990 until his gaoling in September 1993. It is alleged that, during this time, Mr Ryan arranged for Mr Anderson to be paid in cash. This allowed Mr Anderson to make false declarations of his income to the Official Trustee, concealing the income he derived from FIST. It is alleged that, during 1988 to late 1993, FIST had a policy of investing only in government or semi-government bonds. This raises the question as to what duties, if any, Mr Anderson was paid for. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As you know, Mr Speaker, 1994 is the International Year of the Family, and that is a very important opportunity for all of us to focus on the value of families to our society and to individuals within each family. As part of the celebrations for the International Year of the Family, children attending primary schools in my electorate of Moreton were invited to enter an art competition on a theme related to the International Year of the Family. A suggested topic for the visual arts entry was `why my family is important to me'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted to be able to give details of that competition and the wonderful works that were entered in it. The competition closed last week. The entries were judged and are currently on display at the Sunnybank Plaza shopping centre, which is in my electorate. We received 421 entries in this competition from children attending primary schools in my electorate. Every entry was of an outstanding quality and showed not only a very acute understanding of the value of families and the importance of them to the children and to our society but also what talented individuals there are in the electorate of Moreton. It gives us all great hope for the future when there are so many wonderful children who have such great talent. </PARA>

Because of the cooperation that the schools involved have provided in this competition, I am also going to donate a $100 book voucher to the school of the winning student.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad my friend and colleague the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) has been talking about children, because this evening I wish to raise a very serious matter on the same subject. Recently in my electorate there have been two incidents involving applicants under the jobskills program which have potentially placed children at very grave risk.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the first incident a specific request was made of the CES for a list of suitable persons to interview for a position at a kindergarten. One of the persons on the list forwarded to the organisation was a well-known paedophile with a prior conviction. In the second incident another paedophile applied for a position at a primary school via the CES. Not having the benefit of local knowledge, the principal concerned granted an interview. Unbeknown to the school principal, the applicant had previously been charged with various offences relating to children. Within two weeks of the interview, he had appeared in court and been sentenced to a term of imprisonment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) to investigate this matter. I am extremely concerned about the obvious potential for extreme violence to be occasioned to children. I am also extremely concerned for the CES staff who were placed in an invidious and extraordinary position. CES staff members do not have the resources or the legal ability to ascertain the suitability or otherwise of jobskills participants to work with children. I do not know whether the best way to deal with this is a mandatory police record search for employment involving children or some other safety mechanism. Obviously there are privacy concerns related to this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was extremely distressing for the staff of the CES involved when it was brought to their attention. I find it quite extraordinary that there cannot be some mechanism put in place to protect both the children&mdash;who are of greatest importance&mdash;and the staff of the CES, who are only doing their jobs. It is through no fault of their own. The staff of the CES are doing a terrific job getting employment for people in my region. I give them every credit. But I am extremely concerned about the fact that there can be a situation where someone has been charged and has actually appeared in court for offences related to children two weeks after going for such an interview. They are matters of great concern. I hope that on his return the minister for employment will investigate them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two matters of concern that I wish to raise this evening. The first relates to the problems being experienced by Mr Kevin Morris of Thirlmere in my electorate in gaining a liquor licence for his food supermarket. I appreciate that this is essentially a state matter. That is part of the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In both New South Wales and Victoria, in particular, the purchase and possession of liquor licences involves big money, in the vicinity of many tens of thousands of dollars. Mr Morris has come up against incredible bureaucratic obstacles in his efforts to have his application processed. The application has been refused, but the reasons given appear inconsistent with the granting of other licences in similar situations. Mr Morris has now been told he has to wait two years before he can re-apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In New South Wales the process is extremely legalistic and bureaucratic, and the supply of licences is extremely limited. In other states, such as Queensland, the system is much more open and flexible. This is another example of the inefficiencies and inequities caused by having different laws in different states. We see this all the time. We cannot fail to. It is time to look at getting some uniform national laws, in the interests of both economic efficiency and social justice&mdash;particularly with some of the state governments that we have at the moment. I urge the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) to look at this issue with a view to determining what can be done to standardise this very complex area between the states and territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Talking of state governments, the other matter I want to raise concerns the Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital, near Picton, in my electorate, which the Fahey government wants to close. The Queen Victoria is a state owned nursing home with 90 beds funded by the Commonwealth. At the 1990 Health Ministers Conference, a Commonwealth-state agreement was reached to provide increased Commonwealth funding for 75 per cent of beds in state owned nursing homes, to bring them more into line with non-government nursing homes, as well as to provide more than 600 additional hostel beds for New South Wales. The state would be expected to offset the cost of the other 25 per cent of its beds against the additional Commonwealth funding, but this still represented a clear increase in Commonwealth funding for aged care services in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales government's outrageous response to this was to direct its area health boards to look for possible bed closures in state owned nursing homes, like the Queen Victoria, totalling up to one-third of all beds; that is, about 850 beds. It has already had the valuer-general assess the value of the Queen Victoria hospital with a view to its sale. Consultants have been appointed to look at the future of the Queen Victoria, including options such as privatisation. Local residents and Queen Victoria staff launched a campaign to stop the sale, and constituents have contacted my office expressing concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fahey government, obviously worried about the electoral impact in one of its most marginal seats, has put a hold on any sale plans until after the state election next March. The New South Wales health minister, Ron Phillips, and the local state member came out denying that there were any plans to close the Queen Victoria and accusing the Labor Party of lies and scare tactics. If this is so, why is it that I and my office are having so much trouble getting any information about the review being conducted by the south-west Sydney area health service? What does the Fahey government have to hide?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the same government which denied emphatically that it would close the children's ward at Camden District Hospital. These were all `Labor lies', we were told. Yet, sure enough, two weeks later, crunch&mdash;the government closed the children's ward at Camden District Hospital, which is in the middle of an area with more children under five than most areas and with half the population under the age of 20. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales health minister is the same minister who has already been censured by the Legislative Assembly in New South Wales for his mismanagement of the New South Wales health system. It is about time that Mr Phillips and the Fahey government came clean with their plans for the Queen Victoria hospital&mdash;and, indeed, came clean with their plans for the health system in New South Wales generally. </PARA>

In other words, it is alleged that Ryan is withholding FIST fund members' statements, which are required by law to have been given to them over two months ago, because he is frightened that his union members will vote against him when they discover the errors he has made as chairman of their superannuation fund.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first gentleman, Mr John Robinson, enlisted for World War I in 1917 at the age of 16. He served in France and was wounded at Passchendaele. Between the wars he spent 10 years in the Australian militia. In World War II he enlisted in May 1940 and served in the Middle East at Tobruk and in Greece and Crete, where he was made a prisoner of war. In Bavaria as a prisoner of war he spent 1 1/2 years in labouring jobs and then 2 1/2 years in Stalag 383. He returned to Australia in 1945. Mr Robinson walks to two services every Anzac Day; in fact, later in the day I met up with him walking to the sunset service. I think Mr Robinson would agree that one of the crowning events in his life was, in 1990, being a member of the Australian contingent to the Gallipoli commemoration. He speaks of that with great fondness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second gentleman I met on that day was Dr Joe Thorp, aged 98. Had he lived longer he would have been 99 in July. Sadly, he died a few weeks after Anzac Day, but I know he would have been delighted to receive that honour in April. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Thorp was born in Liverpool in the UK and emigrated with his family to Tasmania as a teenager. In 1914 he returned to the UK and enlisted at the age of 18; he enlisted in a medical unit on the advice of his father, who was a general practitioner. He served in Egypt and then in France. He gave service on the ambulance train taking wounded from the Somme, Ypres and Passchendaele to Calais and hospitals in England. Between the wars he went to Sydney University and qualified in medicine and served in various places in Australia before enlisting again in World War II. He was then appointed regimental medical officer and served in Papua New Guinea. He was to have been posted to the Middle East, but the Australian troops were withdrawn prior to his departure. From 1942 to 1944 he was the commanding officer of the convalescent depot in New Guinea which was called Thorpville. In 1945 in Victoria and Western Australia, he was in charge of the convalescent depot for POWs returning home. </PARA>

At his funeral, the eulogy likened him to Weary Dunlop&mdash;and, of course, we know the great works of Edward `Weary' Dunlop in the Asian theatre of war. Dr Thorp may have been in a slightly lower key position but in the same way served his comrades well both as a medical orderly in the First World War and as a practising doctor in the Second World War. He was, in fact, mentioned in dispatches twice.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I take the opportunity to wish you well in your new role in this chamber and I hope that the conduct of the chamber continues at the high level set yesterday. The Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 is a very important bill for non-banking financial institutions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ministerial councils for corporations and for financial institutions have agreed on the principles by which the interface between the Corporations Law and the financial institutions legislation is to be rationalised.

It will also remove any regulatory duplication and reduce the associated administrative burden. </PARA>

The Bendigo Building Society is pleased to support the bill that the government has brought forward, as it clears up the ambiguity as to which law applies&mdash;the financial institutions code or the Corporations Law&mdash;to normal, day-to-day operations as opposed to capital-type raising. I want to comment briefly on the financial worthiness of a couple of organisations within my electorate. One is the Bendigo Building Society and the other is North West Country Credit. North West Country Credit has recently recorded a very successful year. It recorded a $615,000 12 months profit, unaudited at this stage, in the year to 31 March. The manager, Mr John Hall, said that the result was following great support from Bendigonians. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was the best 12-month result in the credit union's 33-year history.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The past 12 months have seen a tremendous growth in our lending as well as quality borrowers being attracted to the local aspect of the credit union.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We've seen a strong and steady growth in deposits in the last 12 months which exemplifies the feeling of confidence in the economy.</PARA>
<PARA>I also want to give brief background details of the worthiness of the Bendigo Building Society. It was established in 1858 as a terminating building society, and is probably the oldest building society in Australia. In 1865 it was re-formed as a permanent building society and has continued in that role. It is a member of the Australian Association of Permanent Building Societies and plays a leading role in that association. It has had a very impressive history. It has survived some very traumatic events. In 1884 the society issued permanent paid-up shares which were non-withdrawable. This was the start of the society's policy of having a base of capital which supported depositors' investment in the Bendigo Building Society. The big bust in 1893, after the housing boom, closed many other societies and some banks in Australia, but the Bendigo society, being based on bricks and mortar, was as sound as a bell and continued to pay dividends right through that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other building societies were established, including the Bendigo and Eaglehawk Star Building Society and the Sandhurst Building Society. In 1942 the Bendigo Building Society reached $1 million in assets. It merged with the Bendigo and Eaglehawk Star Building Society. Total assets in 1978 were $112 million and it had two branches. I know it will be of interest to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the Perth Building Society attempted to take over the Bendigo Building Society in 1981, but I am pleased to report that that offer was repulsed. The Bendigo society then merged with the Sandhurst Building Society to form a society with total assets of $264 million. That was in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Pyramid Building Society collapse was a traumatic event not only for Victoria but also for Australia. It meant a lapse in confidence in building societies to some extent. Despite this, the Bendigo Building Society weathered the storm from its own resources. In 1991 the society acquired the Sandhurst Trustees, an old, established trustee company in Bendigo. In 1992, as part of a rationalisation of the building societies industry, post Farrow and Pyramid Building Society collapse, Bendigo acquired the Capital Building Society in Geelong and the Compass Building Society in Dandenong. At present, the Bendigo Building Society's total assets exceed $1.4 billion. It has 76 branches throughout Victoria and over 370,000 accounts. Client funds invested in the group, including Sandhurst Trustees, total $1.7 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So you can understand, Mr Deputy Speaker, how important it is that there be no ambiguity in the Corporations Law, so that these two fine financial organisations based in Bendigo can understand exactly which law applies to their activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of superannuation has been raised by the Australian Association of Permanent Building Societies, which has been greatly concerned about the government's efforts in superannuation. The association has come up with a unique way to address this, by establishing a superannuation savings account which could be handled by building societies throughout Australia. The societies are desirous that the Corporations Law would cover them in that respect as well so that there would be no ambiguity in terms of their operations. The association has put a suggestion to the government as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.The accounts would be subject to the preservation and other requirements applying to superannuation savings generally and to preferential taxation treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.The accounts would not require a trust deed or be subject to expensive prospectus requirements. Contributions would be deposits made with the society.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Simple plain English terms and conditions to apply with ISC standards would be contained in records of the account which would be either a simple passbook or regular statement account style.</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members in this chamber would be aware of the complications for itinerant workers and casual workers when they pay into a superannuation fund and suddenly find, at the end of a period, that the contributions which have been deducted from their earnings have vanished because of charges made by the superannuation fund. The suggestion continues:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The distinction between SSAs&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>superannuation savings accounts&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">and normal savings accounts would be emphasised and drawn to the attention of members. Ease and simplicity of deposit making would be a feature using the branch network, direct crediting system and ATMs&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>automatic teller machines&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.No special or extra fees would apply to SSA savings accounts with building societies. No entry or exit fees would apply nor would the "flat rate" or "weekly charges", so common in many current superannuation plans. The full amount of savings (less 15% taxation) contributed would be available to grow at market interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA>That would overcome the problem of charges eating away and eroding the payments made under the government's system. The suggestion continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Building societies are subject to uniform and high prudential standards of the Australian Financial Institutions Commission and to the inspection system of the State Supervisory Authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Societies would offer the SSA holder the option to switch into a complying managed superannuation fund of the depositor's choice at any time. No exit fees would apply.</PARA>
<PARA>The societies would not favour any constraint on switching of superannuation savings accounts to superannuation savings accounts in other institutions. Again no exit or entry fees would apply. The suggestion continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.The industry does not favour a uniform maximum cap being placed on SSA accounts. We recommend an ISC requirement that SSA contributors be compulsorily offered managed and growth options by the society each year their account exceeds a balance of $20,000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.The interest rate offered on SSAs would be the current market rate prevailing for saving accounts with clear potential for societies in a competitive environment to offer more attractive rates as the account reaches threshold levels and as it reflects a more stable form of genuine saving than say transaction accounts. In a competitive market each society would determine its policy in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA>I wanted to establish the worthiness of those two organisations in Bendigo, the Bendigo Building Society and North West Country Credit. Both of those organisations are supporting the legislation currently before this chamber. I recognise that it will remove the doubts and any uncertainties from the operations of those non-banking financial institutions as to which law applies to their activities. That will be in the best interests of their customers, their clients, their borrowers, their lenders&mdash;anyone that is involved in that industry needs to have an assurance of being able to operate in an area where there is no ambiguity and no conflict of interest. This bill which is brought before the parliament would give that assurance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like many of my colleagues, this will be my maiden speech in this particular place. I must comment that the atmosphere is really quite different from the other place. It reminds me somewhat of the Northern Territory parliament. I notice from looking at yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> that the interjections appear to be almost conversational. That is caused by the fact that we are all fairly close together here. Perhaps that is a good thing and perhaps, in some cases, it is not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to join the debate in relation to the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. This is another omnibus bill. It seems to me that in the parliament we are now having more and more omnibus bills introduced whereby many acts of the parliament are amended. Those acts in many cases do not have any real relationship with one another but, for reasons of convenience, everything is lumped together into the one bill with the result that changes are made at one vote in the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the amendments in this legislation include: conferring civil jurisdiction under the Corporations Act 1989 and the Corporations Law on lower courts in areas of monetary compensation and debt recovery; introducing the final stage of legislative support for an enhanced electronic settlement system; and extending the application of the fundraising provisions of the Corporations Law to financial institutions, namely, building societies and credit unions. My colleague the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) outlined his interest in that particular aspect of the legislation just a moment ago, and he outlined it very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation excludes the rules of natural justice from procedures to be observed in hearings by the Corporations and Securities Panel and introduces a system of penalty points, $100 per unit, in lieu of reference to a penalty expressed in a dollar amount. The amendments also seek to enable the conversion of certain companies limited by shares to no liability companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the explanatory memorandum before the committee, these amendments are claimed to be necessary to advance the simplification of the Corporations Law. It is admitted that that exercise will take `some little time'. When one looks at the Corporations Law of Australia and one looks at the taxation laws of Australia, it is very clear that these very bulky acts need simplification. To be honest, my impression has been that the parliament has been moving in the wrong direction in that it appears that the Corporations Law is being made ever more complex. One would hope that the government will indeed take on board the very laudable aim of simplifying the law to make it easy for individuals and citizens to know just how the law affects them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spoke earlier this year on the Corporate Law Reform Bill 1993, which basically was to provide for the ongoing disclosure of certain financial information to the Australian Securities Commission by certain entities. During my speech on that bill, I called for the government to give priority to simplifying the Corporations Law and harmonising it to economic objectives. I would welcome any attempt to simplify the complex and cumbersome Corporations Law. I wonder whether the government has yet taken any steps in this direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> suggests that the amendments contained in the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill will help keep the Corporations Law current and streamline the operations of the Australian Securities Commission. I do hope that is correct. The bill will also make a number of other miscellaneous amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to give a brief description of some of the provisions contained in the bill. Part 1 of the bill relates to the conferral of jurisdiction on lower courts. Recently there have been court decisions ruling that lower courts do not have jurisdiction to hear civil claims made under the Corporations Law. The concern stemming from this relates to the fact that many legitimate civil claims may not be pursued under the Corporations Law because of the high cost of bringing actions in superior courts. The problem is compounded by the reluctance of superior courts to consider minor claims. I think most people in society realise that the cost of justice is a major worry and hopefully the amendments contained in this bill to confer some jurisdiction on lower courts will bring the law within the reach of more people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments confer on lower courts, including intermediate courts in each state and territory, civil jurisdiction in respect of corporate law claims relating to debt recovery or monetary compensation. However, civil jurisdiction will not be granted to lower courts where high level discretionary powers are involved. The coalition is not opposing this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second section relates to the introduction of the clearing house electronic subregister system&mdash;CHESS. The Corporations Law provides a legislative framework for the electronic settlement of transactions on the Australian Stock Exchange. Amendments to the provision contained in the Corporations Law facilitate the use of CHESS. The aim of CHESS is to have transactions settled and delivered within three days after trade and to replace the current paper document of transfer with electronic transfer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further technical amendments to support the introduction of CHESS include facilitating electronic acceptance of takeover offers and allowing companies to set cut-off dates for voting purposes in respect of quoted securities. This amendment is also not being opposed by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also introduces amendments which affect the application of the Corporations Law to financial institutions. Currently, the Corporations Law has an uneven application to financial institutions and, in particular, building societies and credit unions, which are mainly regulated by the law enacted by the parliaments in the states and territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will have the following consequences: fundraising provisions of the Corporations Law will apply to financial institutions with certain specified exceptions such as withdrawable shares, deposit taking and other circumstances in which the provisions would not apply if the fundraiser were a bank. The coalition, again, is not opposing this amendment but it is worth noting that the removal of charges over the property of financial institutions from the Corporations Law registration scheme will worsen the fragmentation of personal property security registration in this nation&mdash;and that is, indeed, a major worry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 4 of the bill contains amendments to the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 and the Corporations Law in relation to the functions of the Corporations and Securities Panel which examines matters such as corporate takeovers and can make a declaration of unacceptable conduct. The panel's jurisdiction will be extended to cover matters concerned with takeover conduct generally, and the legislative procedures for the conduct of panel hearings will be amended to specify what constitutes procedural fairness in inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill aims to remedy substantive and procedural difficulties which have been identified with the panel. The panel was set up under the ASC Act and faults were identified when the first application came before the panel. The faults included that the procedures did not discourage time wasting litigation, the requirements of natural justice allegedly hindered the panel from coming to quick decisions, the panel's jurisdiction was too limited and the panel could not enforce undertakings given by parties. I am somewhat concerned about these changes contained in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 4 of this bill excludes the rules of natural justice in relation to an inquiry, excludes legal and other advisers from representing persons appearing before the panel&mdash;they can be present but are not allowed to address the panel. The panel will also be allowed to enforce undertakings given by parties and the jurisdiction of the panel will be broadened to enable the investigation of certain conduct relating to takeovers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always personally supported the principle of procedural fairness and natural justice. Not only in our society should justice be done; it must be seen to be done. Once society loses confidence that, indeed, justice is being done, then we find that our whole system very rapidly will become unstuck. The rules of natural justice provide a standard for ensuring fairness, and their exclusion should be very carefully considered. Natural justice safeguards the rights of people who may be affected by an administrative or quasi-judicial decision to procedural fairness in the making of the decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rules of natural justice have been used by courts for centuries. There are two main principles involved. A decision maker should give a person affected by a decision the chance to be heard&mdash;that is very important&mdash;and a decision maker should not be biased. The rules of natural justice form a part of the common law, and they are there to ensure procedural fairness. They are based on commonsense and common decency, in a democracy where people's human rights are fully understood and accepted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rules of natural justice are so well known to the legal system that very clear and specific wording must be inserted into a statute, if natural justice is to be excluded. Item 20 in schedule 4 of the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 contains an amendment which would insert a revised section 195 in the Corporations Law. The proposed new section will end with these words: `The rules of natural justice do not apply in relation to an inquiry.' Clearly, those very important and clear words will remove those fundamental rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is suggested that regulations to be made under the Corporations Law will provide substitute procedures for the rules of natural justice. I am not for a moment saying that the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and the government are not serious in stating that these regulations will indeed be made in due course. But I do not think that it is right to exclude natural justice before there is an alternative procedure in place. I believe that those replacement safeguards should be detailed in the primary legislation. It is a tragedy and it is quite wrong that the government has omitted those replacement safeguards from the primary legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government does intend to include these safeguards in regulations, why could it not have prepared those safeguards and then put them into this legislation so that, when we come before this committee debating this very important bill, we know that when people's rights are being taken away there will be substitute rights which will ensure that they are not being disadvantaged? We have not seen what the substitute procedures are going to be, and it therefore remains to be seen whether the substitute procedures will be sufficient to equate with the situation in the past, where natural justice has protected people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of Sir Matthew Harris against the Municipal Council of Sydney, admittedly a long time ago, in 1912, it was found that the local government authority was required to give the owner the opportunity to be heard before a building was demolished. As honourable members can see, if the council had gone ahead and demolished the building without giving the person the opportunity to be heard, then clearly the building could not be reconstructed. Thus natural justice was essential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to demolish these fundamental safeguards, which have been entrenched in our legal systems for a very long period of time, then we ought to know what is going to be put into the system to replace them. The explanatory memorandum to the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 says that the rules of natural justice will be replaced by procedures prescribed in regulations. It is about time the government told us what these are going to be. The Attorney-General might be able to let us know when he replies to this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The panel's main hearing to date has been the Titan Hills case, which is said to involve the panel in excessive deliberations arising from the rules of natural justice. This might possibly be the reason that we are finding the amendment being made in the legislation. Sir William Wade, the noted English author of the classic legal text, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Administrative Law</EMPHASIS>, which was undoubtedly the bane of many law students, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Lawyers are a procedurally minded race, and it is natural that administrators should be tempted to regard procedural restrictions invented by lawyers as an obstacle to efficiency. It is true that the rules of natural justice restrict the freedom of administrative action and that their observance costs a certain amount of time and money. But time and money are likely to be well spent if they reduce friction in the machinery of government, and it is because they are essentially rules for upholding fairness and so reducing grievances that the rules of natural justice can be said to promote efficiency rather than impede it.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope the government bears this in mind when it looks at the drafting of its replacement safeguards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another part of the bill includes the ban on legal representatives addressing the panel. This worries me. Of course, in society we have people who have uneven abilities. It is a democratic right in a free society that, if a person is unable to speak adequately on his or her own behalf, that person should be able to retain legally trained people to do that. Some undemocratic regimes in other parts of the world deny people legal representation, and it is worrying to find that the government is inserting that kind of provision in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add that the ban on legal representatives addressing the panel has also been criticised by the Australian Institute of Company Directors, on the grounds that lawyers should have the right to address the panel on matters which affect the legal rights of a party called before the panel, because of the range of orders that can be made by the panel. Quite clearly, the panel will have a great deal of power and will be able to make decisions which impact very seriously on the rights of individuals. If those individuals are not able to put forward a case before the panel adequately then it is pretty clear that justice will not be done. The coalition, of course, is opposing this particular amendment. The coalition is opposing aspects of the bill because we are saying that procedural fairness should be included in the primary legislation, and also that a person appearing before the panel should be able to have someone else speak on his or her behalf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further amendment contained in the bill deals with the notification of review of a Securities Commission decision. This section of the bill contains amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 and the Corporations Law. The amendments exempt, under certain circumstances, the ASC from notifying all persons whose interests are affected by a reviewable decision. The proposed amendments place an onus on the ASC to take reasonable steps to notify people affected by an ASC decision. The ASC, in doing so, can consider costs involved in notification, how the person will be affected and whether notice is warranted under the circumstances. The coalition is not opposing this amendment. It would be advisable for the ASC to issue a statement listing the categories of people to whom it might consider giving notice, and representations could then be made to the ASC by interested parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also provides for the establishment of stock markets in unquoted prescribed interests on which the interests may be traded by means of an electronic trading facility. This will require ministerial approval. The Australian Stock Exchange claims the amendments do not go far enough in providing for an efficient market and ensuring that the public interest is safeguarded. Again, the coalition is not opposing this amendment. However, the government should closely monitor the operations of this amendment in light of the Australian Stock Exchange concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also provides amendments to the definitions of `securities' and `futures contract' and concern has been expressed by legal practitioners, academics and people  involved in the industry over this proposal. I understand this proposal will allow for consideration to be given to trading on the Australian stock and futures markets of specified kinds of agreements which may not fall squarely with the current definitions of `securities' or `futures contract'. There has not been sufficient time for consideration of the concerns raised by lawyers and others. The amendments were not contained in the exposure draft of the bill and the coalition is not happy with this amendment either. We would really like to see it have further consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also allows companies limited by shares to convert to no liability status. This allows companies to offer shares at a discount without a requirement to obtain court approval for the offer, thereby making the investment more attractive. Currently a no liability company, which is usually a mining company, can convert to a limited liability company but cannot convert in the other direction. The amendment deals with an irregularity which has caused problems for the mining industry; and the coalition is not opposing this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other minor amendments proposed in the bill. It applies penalty units to the Corporations Law and the ASC Act, allowing for pecuniary penalties imposed by national scheme laws to be varied more easily. It transfers responsibility for unclaimed money and property from the minister to the ASC. It enables certificates of incorporation of a company and registration of a charge to be used in courts outside the state or territory in which the company is incorporated. Other non-contentious amendments include facilitating the trading on the Australian Stock Exchange of options over unissued shares. Also, the legislation amends the provision concerning the making of declarations of exempt futures markets to ensure that the conditions of declarations may be enforced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this is a bill where the coalition is not opposing many of the provisions, I have however outlined concerns that we have. I hope that the government favourably considers those concerns and acts on them, if not in this piece of legislation then in a subsequent bill to be brought before the parliament. </PARA>

It has designed these amendments to streamline its functions while this review is under way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Key reforms included in the bill include: the conferral of civil jurisdiction under the Corporations Law on lower courts; amendments that will support the introduction of the clearing house electronic subregister system, or CHESS; an extension of the application of the Corporations Law to building societies and credit unions; the establishment of a modified regime to notify persons affected by ASC decisions of their rights of review; provision for the establishment and regulation of markets in unquoted prescribed interests using screen based trading systems, which I am sure you are familiar with, Mr Deputy Speaker; and the varying of the application of the rules of natural justice from proceedings heard by the Corporations and Securities Panel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) said yesterday, the Liberal Party supports most of these measures. The current uncertainty over the ability of district and county courts to hear claims under the Corporations Law may discourage legitimate but small civil claims from being heard, especially when the reluctance of superior courts to consider minor claims is taken into account.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What he is actually telling us is that section 4 will virtually exclude the rules of natural justice in relation to inquiries, regardless of the amendment that the government moved yesterday, a move that should always be cause for concern. The amendments may end procedural fairness in the panel's operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to look at the panel's background and its operations before discussing this point further. The Corporations and Securities Panel was established under the 1989 ASC Act. The panel was supposed to be similar to the London Takeovers Panel. This body is a voluntary panel made up of all large business and service organisations in the City of London through which all major takeovers proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was envisaged that the panel would act as a peer review body which would be able to come to quick decisions on matters relating to takeovers to ensure that participants and affected parties and shareholders could make decisions on the basis of full information. As such, the panel was composed almost entirely of people with significant business experience, so commercial matters such as takeovers could be dealt with in a commercial&mdash;rather than legalistic&mdash;fashion by people such as merchant bankers and corporate solicitors rather than judges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The panel operated independently of the ASC. The ASC was to refer matters to the panel when it considered that unacceptable behaviour may have occurred, and the panel would review the matter and decide whether or not to make a declaration and to issue orders. Parties could not appeal as to the facts but only on points of law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Speedy and final resolutions to problems are important in takeovers. It is no good having a lengthy legal process or appeals and other similar delays. The panel was supposed to play an important role in facilitating this. However, insufficient consideration was given to the legislative changes needed to ensure that the panel would work as intended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very first application to come before the panel, the 1991 takeover bid by Titan Hills for Provision Data, highlighted substantive and procedural difficulties and resulted in five court actions, including one which went to the High Court. Rather than the panel dealing with the matter before it quickly, the Titan Hills case showed how events could become bogged down in front of the panel as legal representatives for the parties presented lengthy legalistic arguments. The matter was referred to the panel in May 1991, but no final decision was made until December 1991, seven months later. By that time, of course, the decision had been overtaken by events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parties finally agreed on a curative proposal, or settlement, involving a cash payment to uncommitted shareholders. However, the panel ruled that it had no power to consider matters that had occurred after the ASC's original referral for a declaration. The decision, of course, prejudiced the ability of the panel to reach a commercial judgment based on all relevant matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The time lag defeated one of the key policy reasons for the panel, namely, the ability&mdash;so vital in the fast-moving environment of takeovers, when delay may kill the purpose of action&mdash;to deal with the matters quickly. This has meant that unacceptable behaviour has largely been ignored by the ASC, as it has not referred matters to the panel. It does not mean that unacceptable behaviour has stopped. As the panel does not have the power to initiate a review, the ASC has been forced to attempt to act against unacceptable behaviour through civil proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The panel became bogged down in legal issues because of its power to make declarations and issue orders. As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Companies and Securities Bulletin</EMPHASIS> commented, this ability to seriously affect individuals' rights and the issues of natural justice led to the involvement of a long list of barristers in the cases in a way that was not envisaged when the panel was mooted. The bill aims to streamline the operations of the panel. As part of this, point 3 of the new section 195 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rules of natural justice do not apply in relation to an inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA>Instead, the section earlier on states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Inquiries are to be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the regulations.</PARA>
<PARA>The government's most recent amendment adds that the regulations will `equate to the rules of natural justice.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party recognises the need to improve the current situation. But it is entirely excessive for the government to attempt to vary natural justice to those appearing before the panel. It is worth while to remind ourselves of the role and importance of natural justice. Natural justice is a common law doctrine which courts apply when reviewing administrative or quasi-judicial decisions. It safeguards the right to procedural fairness of people affected by these decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Natural justice involves two main principles: that a party whose interests are affected has a right to be heard, and that a decision maker should not be biased. Two further principles are often added: the need for probate evidence, and the reasons for decisions. The minister has stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over zealous demands that procedural fairness be afforded may be a major impediment to an expeditious hearing as required by the (Corporations) Law.</PARA>
<PARA>Natural justice will be replaced with procedures, to be specified in the regulations accompanying the bill, to allow the panel to make decisions more quickly without disruption from parties and their legal advisers raising these common law principles. Acts of parliament can override the common law and it is possible for statutes to exclude natural justice. However, any legislative act that varies the application of the rules of natural justice should be very carefully examined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Adherence to the rules of natural justice and corporate regulation has become a topical issue in Australia. The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has been conducting an inquiry into the powers of officers of the Australian Securities Commission. In February this year, taking evidence in Brisbane, the committee heard a range of specific allegations against ASC investigators of harassment and denial of natural justice. The committee is yet to report on these matters but they have been given an airing in the media and carried on news reports. The panel is, of course, not one and the same as the ASC but it is established under the ASC Act. The ASC's predecessor, the National Companies and Securities Commission, was the subject of allegations of maverick behaviour. We do not want corporate cowboys but, as vigilante regulators are also undesirable, these concerns should be mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past, the panel has observed the rules of natural justice. Now the government has said that these are impeding prompt decision making by the panel and causing increased costs and delays. It is important to remember the yardstick for ensuring fairness that the rules of natural justice have provided in the past. Their variance should be a matter of serious consideration. Indeed, as this amendment is of considerable importance, it can even be debated whether such a measure should be contained in a bill supposed to consist of only a few `miscellaneous amendments'. If the fundamental rules of natural justice are to be all but eliminated, then it would appear only appropriate for their replacements to be contained in primary legislation rather than regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is allowing us no opportunity to scrutinise the procedures that will be substituted for the principles of natural justice and will deny us the chance to debate or amend them. The Australian Institute of Company Directors has already claimed that the effective ban on legal representatives addressing the panel that this bill will impose should be lifted to allow lawyers the right to address the panel in matters which will directly affect the legal rights and interests of the parties called before it. The honourable member for Tangney has foreshadowed an amendment in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been pointed out that, although the panel considers market behaviour and standards rather than technical legal issues, a knowledge and appreciation of takeover regulation, often complex and legalistic itself, is needed for inquiries. This may not only require representation by lawyers but support from other experts such as accountants, stockbrokers and financial analysts. Given the range of orders that can be made by the panel, this measure must be considered unacceptable. Indeed, other aspects of the bill make a mockery of the government's intentions to streamline the operations of the panel. The panel will be superfluous if further appeals to courts&mdash;where matters may be dealt with by judicial officers with little experience in commerce, let alone takeovers&mdash;are still allowed. There can be no doubt that the rules of procedural justice should be detailed in the legislation. Persons appearing before the panel should be able to have another person to speak on their behalf and, if the panel is to have any real influence, appeals should be limited to matters of law and not the merits of decisions of the panel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one further aspect of this bill which I wish to comment on&mdash;the now withdrawn amendments that would have given the government significant powers to alter the definitions of securities and futures contracts by regulation and without consultation. These provisions did not appear in the draft copy of the legislation released for industry and public review. The industry was understandably angry and concerned at the possibility of distortions in the regulation of over-the-counter and exchange traded derivatives. There is a need for flexibility to allow the ASX derivatives section and the Sydney Futures Exchange to conduct markets in new products and compete with overseas exchanges. Proposals for exchange traded products should not have adverse consequences for over-the-counter derivatives. The minister has said the proposals have been dropped to allow greater consultation and, as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper has noted, in the face of strong opposition from the Liberal Party and particularly the honourable member for Tangney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear much of consultation from this government but all too often we actually see very little of it. I understand that when the decision was made to postpone these amendments, rather than issuing a release, the minister's staff phoned a few key players. I hope the consultation process will be somewhat more substantive and not carried out in a similar way. The over-the-counter derivatives market is now worth some $500 billion. I would hope that the government may be able to formulate proposals that are in line with the needs of the market and that will be compatible with the long-term reform recommendations currently under study by the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee. Of course, it would be entirely out of character for the government to pay heed to the other significant objection that the Liberal Party has raised and that I have discussed today. Then again, when we see some glimmer of light, I suppose we should still hold out some hope. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I thank all the members who participated in this debate. This is certainly one of the first full-blown debates in this new committee, and I think it has proceeded very well. I thank the members, particularly the members of the opposition, who are broadly in support of the provisions in this bill. There is disagreement on one point regarding the operation of some of the provisions regarding the panel, and I will address that in a little while. But, essentially, members have expressed support for the vast majority of items in the debate. I will touch on some of the items raised by members, particularly by the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), who outlined a most cogent case on behalf of the opposition members. Other members of the opposition expanded on some of the points that the honourable member raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, there was some criticism of the government's action in relation to the way it dealt with the definitions of `securities' and `futures contract'. Much has been made of the point that this particular provision was not included in the original bill for exposure and that it was subsequently withdrawn. I remind the committee what the circumstances were. The government was responding to an express request by the Australian Stock Exchange in relation to its desire to develop a new hybrid product between a security and a future. The Stock Exchange believes that this product will bring to the Australian market an innovation which is not seen in other markets around the world and which, potentially, will be of major commercial significance to this country. The time frame which the Stock Exchange was putting to the government at that time was that it wanted to place this product on the market on 1 July. It was in response to that particular request that the government went down this path. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept that it is not desirable that measures of this sort should not be subject to the full processes of consultation. However, there are occasions when one needs to be able to weigh the very great benefit gained through full consultation against other commercial and competing realities. This was one of those judgment decisions. The benefit which I believe, and which the Stock Exchange still argues, will flow to the Australian economy through the development of this product was one which, on balance, deserved the government's speedy response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As events turned, the exchange advised that it would not be ready to proceed with this product until later in the year. We immediately took the opportunity to withdraw these particular provisions to allow for consultation. It was stated that there was no other consultation at all. That is simply not true. There was consultation with other players in this field, particularly the Sydney Futures Exchange. It certainly was not of the length which they would like, but if they have been putting out that they were not told at all, they are not being accurate. They certainly were told, and they were told about a month before the provision arose. I accept that that is not a long enough period, and that the detail supplied to them was not sufficient. But to say that they were not told at all until the thing ended up in the bill is simply not true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding that, there are two issues which flow from it, although we should not spend too much time on it, since it is not actually part of the bill now. One issue concerns the over-the-counter trades. It is not the government's intention that these changes to the definitions should have impact on the over-the-counter trades. We will make clear, in the revised provisions which will come forward a little later in the year, that the over-the-counter trades are not affected by these proposals. That should satisfy one of the levels of concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second level of concern is what appropriate regulations we put in. When we have one of these hybrid products, do we apply the chapter of the Corporations Law which relates to the securities market, do we apply the chapter of the law which applies to the futures market, or what combination of the two do we apply? That is the debate we need to have. It seems to me that it is a fairly fundamental debate, because this is not going to be the only time that products of this type will come forward. We are already seeing the Sydney Futures Exchange develop its own form of hybrid product. For instance, one can now trade in individual futures on individual shares. That is a new development which the futures market has put into the marketplace in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are real issues here about how we adequately regulate this emerging market, which is neither fish nor fowl, and what combination of the law we use. Maybe there needs to be some sort of amalgam of the chapters. That will need serious debate. Whether we can have that sort of serious debate and that sort of outcome and still allow the Stock Exchange to develop its product is doubtful, and we might have to proceed on an interim basis. That will be less than satisfactory, but in terms of making sure that we are not disadvantaging our own markets that may be the path we have to go down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The substance of the debate then turned on the operation of the panel. Talking a bit about the philosophy of it, the honourable member for Tangney again described this panel as being neither fish nor fowl: a combination including peer review, but not limited to that, in that it has some ability to make decisions which are binding&mdash;and, as such, an awkward creature. I suppose that is a fair comment, but a couple of points need to be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, if the Australian corporate sector wishes to develop its own systems of peer review which have nothing to do with the government, but may get some support from the government, we are very happy for it to do that. We are seeing some developments along this line. For instance, I raised in the House last week the development of the Stock Exchange incorporating within its listing rules certain ethical requirements and codes of practice in terms of the way in which company directors and companies operate, largely along the lines of the Cadbury code in the United Kingdom. That is a good example of corporate governance issues being taken up through a self-regulatory body such as the Stock Exchange. We are seeing various moves from the Australian Investment Managers Group and the genuine initiatives that the group pursues, and that again is something which the government very much encourages&mdash;as do I, personally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we have to face the fact that Australia has not had a very strong history of peer review, and we have tended to be a country which has approached corporate regulation through means of government legislative action. I do not know that that is particularly desirable in all cases, and as a general approach I am trying to move away from that and take the simplification approach. We have had considerable difficulties with the panel also going down that path, but the thrust of the panel is that it is not making legal determinations of whether something complies with the law. It is envisaged that generally something which would be brought before the panel would be a proposal which would be within the letter of the law, but not within its spirit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea of the peer review is to concentrate on the sort of conduct which does no credit for the operation of the Australian markets but is not adequately accounted for by the actual strict operation of the law. Obviously, it does not matter how prescriptive the laws are. In fact, the more prescriptive the laws are, there are always going to be numerous cases which are not picked up although often they are within the intent of the law. The panel was to play that role&mdash;peer review by people experienced in corporate matters, business people making judgments and being involved in the review of corporate actions by other business people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the history of the panel has not been a happy one. The case that did go before it simply ended up in one of the largest legal cases that we have seen for some time. It certainly went nowhere near meeting the time frames prescribed for giving its decisions. It ended up in a High Court appeal against part of the panel's operation. There was obviously a need to review the procedures to see whether we could breathe life into this concept. I suppose at the end of the day, if these proposals do not succeed in the panel operating effectively, unfortunately I do not see much future for it. The thing has to operate on terms of good spirit and goodwill between the markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things needed was some guidance as to the rules of natural justice which were applying; that is where a lot of the debate went on. The government's proposals here are aimed at specifying in some detail the procedures which the panel should be following, setting those out in a way which is clear both to the panel and to people and businesses which will be called before the panel. That is why we have gone down the path of setting these things out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the amendment which the government will propose concerning the application of the regulations which set out the procedures intended to equate to the rules of natural justice will not be opposed by the opposition. I gather from the honourable member for Tangney, however, that he is not terribly comfortable with that in totality. I do not know exactly why the opposition is supporting this, given the rather strong reservations expressed by the honourable member. Nonetheless, I am grateful that the opposition is supporting that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point where there is dispute, and there will be an amendment moved by the honourable member, concerns the exclusion of advisers. We are talking largely about lawyers. Some honourable members may include stockbrokers or other financial analysts there. That is possible but I think that in real terms we are talking about lawyers. This is excluding lawyers or any other advisers whatsoever not from giving people advice, which it is their proper right to have, or attending with them at panel deliberations, but from actually getting up on the hind legs and addressing the panel or conducting cross-examinations&mdash;in effect, taking over the proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I read the provision&mdash;I have had this checked through the Office of General Counsel&mdash;there is nothing here precluding the panel, at its discretion, from allowing an adviser or a lawyer to get up and address it on a particular matter if the panel thinks that would be of benefit to the panel in resolving a particular item. What we are precluding is any absolute, unfettered right or entitlement of an adviser to address the panel. In that way we will focus on these proceedings being matters of peer review. Hopefully, we will have this panel discussing the acceptability of business conduct and not legal arguments or arguments of that sort. If we end up having to have legal arguments before the panel, it will have failed. It simply will have failed and we will not have achieved our end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It really should be peer review, with business people speaking to business people and coming to a conclusion on the acceptability, in terms of the market practice and good corporate practice, of particular behaviour. If we get that outcome, then we will have a useful adjunct to our armoury. However, if we simply end up with a body which is turned into a pseudo-court in some way, then I think we will have largely defeated the purpose, and I would be dubious about its long-term future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So let us make it clear that lawyers, or other advisers, will certainly be in the room sitting next to their clients. They will be able to advise them. They will be able to give whatever advice is necessary in terms of the presentation of written material. If I am right&mdash;and, as I said, I have had it confirmed through the Office of General Counsel&mdash;the panel itself is by no means precluded by these provisions from asking an adviser to clarify a particular point, if the panel believes that is useful, but we are stopping the automatic right of someone to get up and make representations. So, in my mind, this is a reasonable conclusion and should be supported for those reasons. No doubt we will talk about it a bit later, but the government will not be supporting that particular amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were a few other points which the honourable member raised. He asked about the changes regarding charges, in that they are to be regulated under the financial institutions legislation. He was worried that this would worsen the fragmentation of personal property security registration in Australia. I have some sympathy for that view, I have to say. However, this is a very strong point of view which was put by the states and, given the cooperative nature of our federalism, the Commonwealth conceded that point. However, a Law Reform Commission report on personal property securities is now before the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. It may be that through consideration of that report we will look again at this issue and the states might reconsider their view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member also asked a practical question as to whether there will be a transfer of charges over financial institution property registered under the Corporations Law to state registers. I am advised on that point that the Australian Securities Commission and the Australian Financial Institutions Commission are discussing the administrative arrangements in relation to the changes included in this bill. Both of those organisations understand the desirability of reaching an arrangement whereby those people searching a register of charges do have a comprehensive register. This is something which they are discussing and, hopefully, we can come to an arrangement which will accommodate that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I thank honourable members for their support. It is unfortunate that we do not have total agreement on every provision in this bill. There is one point of disagreement, but on the whole I think these are useful reforms in a variety of areas. I thank members for their contributions.</PARA>

<PARA>This raises the issue referred to by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) in his reply, and that is the question of the entitlement of a person appearing at an inquiry before the Corporations and Securities Panel to have a representative, not only assisting, but actually addressing the panel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As formulated in the bill, subsection 194(4) provides for the entitlement of a person who appears to have another person present to assist. It then goes on to say that the person who so assists is not entitled to address the panel. It seems to me that, irrespective of the merits of the principle of excluding that person from addressing the panel in that way, it gets picked up by the wrong handle. A person who so assists would not, in any forum, normally have a right, or an entitlement&mdash;using the language of the bill&mdash;to address the panel but would only have a right of audience. The entitlement to address would be as agent of the person who appears at the inquiry. It may be a small point but, since the Attorney-General has suggested that it does not exclude the granting of leave by the panel to a person in a particular case, it may be something that is worth addressing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the reasons that I offered in my speech in the second reading debate, we believe that it is inappropriate, in a situation where a body such as this panel has power to affect the rights and duties of persons, that the right of an agent to address as well as otherwise assist should be excluded.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is good to be part of history, the first time that a matter has to be referred back to the main chamber. I do not think this particular amendment will have the same effect. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 4, page 35, item 20, proposed subsection 195(3), omit the proposed subsection, substitute the following subsection:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"`(3) It is intended that this Division and the regulations will set out procedural requirements that equate to the rules of natural justice.'.".</PARA>
<PARA>This particular amendment, as we have canvassed before, deals with the application of the rules of natural justice to the proceedings of the panel. The provision which appeared in the bill made the bland statement that the rules of natural justice should not apply&mdash;or do not apply. Naturally enough, the opposition took some exception to that particular provision and, through a process of discussion with the office of Senator Vanstone, the shadow Attorney-General, I understand agreement has been reached on the wording of this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intention of the provision&mdash;hopefully, made clearer by the amendment&mdash;is not that there not be the application of natural justice to the way this panel operates. The basic rules of natural justice are that people have the right to be heard and to comment on adverse material before a particular body and that people are entitled to an unbiased adjudicator in such matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Beyond that, courts have added to or detracted from the rules of natural justice. It is a bit of a moveable feast in a sense, and I noted with some interest the recent decision of the Federal Court in the case of Teoh on what it deemed to be appropriate in the rules of natural justice in an immigration case. It is an area which is of some interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this particular case, through the regulations we are attempting to set out in some detail the procedures which should be followed by the panel and by people who have business before the panel. The procedures in the regulations set out a scheme which reasonably protects people's rights and outlines the fair operation of the panel and the way those proceedings should go ahead. It would be unfortunate if the panel were to then be subjected to court challenge in terms of the way it operates in following these procedures. Such a challenge is, of course, possible but, in such an event, the provision in this amendment is showing that the legislature's intention is that the procedures set out in the regulations equate to the rules of natural justice, and maybe that will be something which a court, if there were such a challenge, would take into account. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I have previously indicated, it is not the intention of the coalition to oppose this motion but, as I have also indicated, I have some uneasiness personally with it. The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has sought to justify the terms. I think I should explain in a bit more detail the reason for my uneasiness. The provision in the bill effectively excludes natural justice from the proceedings of the panel. That would mean that, if a challenge to the procedure of the panel were taken to a court, the court would not have regard to decisions on procedural fairness in order to determine whether the procedure was in fact fair.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment says, in effect, that what is set out in the act and the regulations is the equivalent of natural justice. In other words, the procedure is the statement of the procedural fairness that will apply in proceedings before the panel. If one contemplates what is going to happen when the procedure before the panel is subject to a challenge before a court, the effect seems to me to be almost identical to the exclusion of natural justice. What it is doing is saying that what we have set out as the procedure in the act and the regulations is natural justice; and if those procedural rules do not cover the situation, the court is effectively excluded from going to background rules or background precedent in order to determine what is procedurally fair in this uncontemplated situation. So it does not seem to me to change matters very much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have such confidence in the government or the Attorney-General's Department or in the Office of Parliamentary Counsel as to make the assumption that all the procedures that will be required to be employed before the panel have been dealt with in the act or the regulations. It seems to me that the panel is going to be in a rather difficult situation, having been told that this is the limit of procedural rules it is allowed to operate under and nothing else will be effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It means, perhaps, that there will be a second level of procedural rule. It will not be recognised by a court but it will have to be applicable. I think it raises complexities that need not be there. While I accept that the panel is meant to operate informally and summarily and deal with matters relatively quickly and procedural fairness ought not to be a problem, there will inevitably be situations, if the panel does succeed in attracting business to itself, where there will be a need to resolve what procedure is to be adopted. It seems to me that the government would have nothing to lose by saying, `These are the rules' and otherwise leaving the ordinary rules of procedural fairness to apply. </PARA>

<PARA>The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1994, which is now before the House, contains a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. Some of the amendments have already been introduced as customs tariff proposals. I will briefly outline the changes of substance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 3 is operative from 1 September 1993. It designates Eritrea as a developing country under the Australian system of tariff preferences. This follows Australia's formal recognition of Eritrea as an independent country on 4 May 1993. Prior to that date, Eritrea was considered to be part of Ethiopia. This action will allow imports of Eritrean origin to enter Australia at concessional rates of duty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further amendments contained in this schedule give effect to the government's decision, as announced in the 1993-94 federal budget, to increase the customs duty on aviation gasoline and aviation kerosene by 0.264c per litre. These changes will enable the Civil Aviation Authority to recover part of the cost of aviation safety regulation from the industry. The balance of the industry's contribution will be phased in over the next two years. There is a complementary change contained in section 6 of this bill which inserts the tariff subheading for aviation kerosene in the table to section 26(1) of the principal act. As a result, consumer price index increases will be applied to the rate of duty for this product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 4 of the bill will operate from 14 days after the bill receives royal assent and creates item 63 in schedule 4 to the principal act. Reference materials are materials of accurately known composition which are used as the standard against which like materials, processes and apparatus are calibrated. Access to reference materials at world prices, without the added impost of duty, is important if Australian industry is to be internationally competitive. Most of the analytical standards used in Australia for a range of testing purposes are not produced locally and must be imported. Concessional entry can be best delivered through a new policy item. This approach has industry support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its 1991 Building a Better Australia statement, the government announced that, commencing on 1 July 1992, it would phase out the bounty payable on the production of certain textile yarn over the following three years. In its stead, the government will introduce from 1 July 1995 a five per cent tariff duty on the subject yarn. The amendments contained in schedule 5 put in place the new tariff rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other changes are of an administrative nature and have no duty implications.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the coalition, I am representing the responsible shadow minister. He cannot be here today, so I will read some of the advice he has given me, and then move to the matters that are of particular concern to me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill replaces the current bounty on textiles, clothing and footwear products with a five per cent tariff. Given that the five per cent tariff is to be applied to all imports, the Australian system of tariff preferences, which gives preferential tariff treatment to developing countries, does not apply in this case. This measure is one of a number of changes arising from the 1990 review of the textile, clothing and footwear plan. The changes to be phased in by 1995 include: the abolition of TCF quotas by 1993; the phase-down of tariffs to 25 per cent by the year 2000; extra funding for the industry's development strategy; the introduction of an imports credit scheme; and the abolition of bounties on 1 July 1995. They are replaced with a five per cent tariff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The replacement of bounty with a tariff will continue the phased reduction of protection for the industry. For example, a bounty of 20 per cent and based on 75 per cent value added is equivalent to a 15 per cent tariff. This measure has the support of industry and is a central plank in the TCF plan to which industry has been working. Moreover, it is upon this plan that the industry has modelled its restructuring and made investment decisions. The TCF industry has invested some $630 million over the past three years. Given this and the importance of fostering business confidence and industry stability, the coalition will not oppose the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of minor administrative amendments are also proposed in this bill, including: the removal of redundant quota provisions from the principal act; the import of reference material free of duty; the consolidation of tariff headings; and the recognition of Eritrea as a developing country and its inclusion in the developing country tariff preference scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we also heard from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay), the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1994, like the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill that we debated just over a month ago, contains measures to increase the duty on aviation gasoline and aviation kerosene by 0.264c per litre and to make this subject to consumer price index increases for the purpose of enabling the Civil Aviation Authority to recover part of the cost of aviation safety regulation from the aviation industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That would be all well and good if it did not beg a very central question: what air safety regulation? I spoke during debate on the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill of my concern about the CAA and its administration of air safety regulation, a concern that initially sprang from the fact that five people from my electorate died, along with the pilot and co-pilot, in a tragic Monarch airline crash at Young one year ago this coming Saturday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been appalled to learn that the CAA was well aware that the airline in question, Monarch Air, was a shonky operator of the first order, that CAA airworthiness inspectors had recommended its grounding less than two months before the crash, and that CAA had identified Monarch as a major problem as early as November 1991 but had done next to nothing about ensuring that an operator which was clearly a threat to the safety of the travelling public was stopped from operating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me state at the outset that most regional airlines operate in an exemplary manner. They carry out proper maintenance programs, they have proper flying operations and they are responsible people. But as with so much of life, there are a few rotten apples in the barrel. It is to these people that I address my remarks. Since my last speech, many people have provided me with further information that confirms beyond doubt that air safety regulation is in very dire straits in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the industry, the story was consistent: from an aircraft mechanic who complained of the pressure brought to bear on him to release aircraft that in fact needed further maintenance, to people inside the CAA itself who are distressed that their very purpose and their mission statements are being made a mockery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inescapable conclusion is that the CAA has absolutely fallen victim to commercial priorities and has virtually abandoned the primacy of its air safety regulatory role as set out in the act. With the formation of the CAA, the self-insurance cover of the Commonwealth was lost, and the CAA was obliged to take out its own insurance. It carries a series of policies for a variety of liabilities through brokers. Basic in that cover is the constraint placed on the CAA by its insurers not to admit fault or to face a voiding of its policy as their consequence. This means that it is simply not possible for the CAA to admit fault. Therefore, the CAA has a very real problem from the outset in acknowledging that there is error and setting it to rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, the commercial needs of the relationship with the insurers take precedence over the need for regulation of air safety and the need to be subject to continuing scrutiny and self-correction, with the result that the CAA has developed a tendency to cover up and to paper over the cracks in order to protect its insurance arrangements. When those cracks are related to the safety of the travelling public, that is simply not to be tolerated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following my revelation of its manifest shortcomings in dealing with Monarch, rather than addressing the problem, CAA has gone into damage control mode&mdash;firstly, by seeking to deny that the problem exists, but also by embarking on witch-hunts in an effort to discover the source of the leaks which enable the truth about its blunders with Monarch to see the light of day at all. To put it simply, the CAA has closed ranks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The undeniable truth is that there is a systemic disease in the CAA. What I have learned about its operations since my speech a month ago leads me to conclude that the CAA has become some sort of flying boys club where favours are traded and the mates system flourishes, leading to a very serious form of corruption which undermines the very principles which would enable regulation without fear or favour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a case that has all the attributes of a Pink Panther movie set at Fawlty Towers about it and that is shortly to see some alleged offenders against the civil aviation regulations brought before the court, but only because the CAA spectacularly bungled its efforts to keep its mates out of court. Because the case is shortly to come before the court, and it is therefore sub judice, I will not refer to the protagonists by name, or in any way identify them. Let me call them Basil Fawlty and Peter Sellers. What matters in the story is the CAA's extraordinary behaviour in seeking to prevent the prosecution of the case at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a regional aero club, Basil Fawlty was an approved test officer, which means that he was delegated by the CAA to test applicants for pilot's licences and endorsements. In the case of Peter Sellers' application for a pilot's licence, some suspicion arose about the conduct of this delegation, because, on the day when Mr Sellers' flying test was supposed to have taken place, Mr Fawlty, the approved test officer, was not even at the airport, let alone present at the test.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will leave the determination of the merits of case against Mr Fawlty and Mr Sellers to the legal system. But just what did Mr Basten, the CAA officer at the centre of responsibility for air safety regulation, think he was doing in seeking to prevent the prosecution taking place? That interference echoes another case that I referred to last month in this place, where a senior CAA officer also attempted to have a case withdrawn from prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CAA's job is to protect the travelling public from danger; it is not to protect aviation operators from the processes of the law. Unfortunately, this matey protectionism is not confined to flying operators, either. Winrye, a maintenance firm at Bankstown, has been a persistent offender against civil aviation regulations and requirements. Over the past two years, a series of noncompliance notices issued for breaches of regulations and procedures led to a `show cause' letter being sent to the owner demanding that the owner show cause why his certificate to operate should not be varied or cancelled. This owner, described as a maverick by many within the industry, did not even reply to this letter, which is an offence in itself. </PARA>

Two months ago, a further series of noncompliance notices led to another `show cause' letter.

<PARA>to head office in Canberra. To this date, however, no action has been taken against the firm&mdash;two months later. The proprietor is also, interestingly enough, deeply involved in war birds. Again, the flying mates syndrome can be seen here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The flying mates syndrome was strongly in evidence in Adelaide in the issue of licences for aircraft maintenance engineers to a series of former air force engineers who did not hold appropriate qualifications. The issue of these licences, by a CAA licensing officer who had been an air force colleague of the applicants, came to the attention of the CAA's Wagga Wagga district office when renewal of one was sought there. The airworthiness inspector at Wagga Wagga district office described the licence issues as `fraudulent' and made a series of recommendations for corrective action. While senior officers agreed with that inspector that the licences were issued without proper qualifications, no action was taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is a serious one and puts in doubt a number of licences issued since 1991 by the CAA officer in question and, possibly, by others. The issue of these licences has been described as using the `freebie in the breakfast cereal box' method. The fact that the method involves former Australian Defence Force personnel, whose experience in aviation and whose responsibilities do not parallel those of the licensed aircraft maintenance engineer, makes that practice dangerous. That so many are apparently former colleagues of the licensing officer or officers makes it potentially corrupt. Only engineers meeting the very high standards specified in the civil aviation regulations should be entrusted with the responsibilities of licensed aircraft maintenance engineers, which directly affect the standards of aviation safety. Any watering down of these standards is not to be tolerated. When these occur as a product of a mateship code, the situation is not only dangerous but severely out of control, and threatens the lives of countless thousands of people each week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CAA is repeatedly displaying symptoms of an organisation that is out of control and that has completely lost its way. The CAA report in August last year on Singleton Air Services, trading as Yanda Airlines, identified a number of serious deficiencies in various aspects of that company's operation. The report found that the chief pilot had failed to ensure that company pilots complied with the required procedures&mdash;as indeed he himself had failed to do; that proper certification of both scheduled and unscheduled maintenance was not undertaken; and that those responsible had not ensured that maintenance was carried out when required. It listed failure to observe defect recording, to apply the minimum equipment list and in the maintenance control manual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is a litany of violations, which led the senior airworthiness inspector to recommend that immediate action be taken against the air operator's certificate. That recommendation was not acted upon, and an action plan was adopted for the operator to be given another chance. Subsequent ramp checks still reflected shortcomings in Yanda's fulfilment of requirements. It is relevant that the responsible district airworthiness manager, in a CAA internal electronic memorandum, had said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have no doubt that the Governing Director of the company is well aware of the way the operation is conducted and doubt that any sustained improvement will occur unless we are prepared to cancel the operator's RPT AOC.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a regular public transport air operators certificate. But the CAA has made it clear that cancelling a regular public transport air operators certificate is just what it is not prepared to do. The operators have become the CAA's customers, and the customer, in the end, is always right. Even when the need for the strongest action is recognised within the CAA, the commercial culture takes over and regulatory inertia sets in. It is the inertia in the regulatory function that has become the greatest problem of the CAA and it is a direct result of confusion over the CAA's fundamental purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the government is determined to reduce its contribution to the funding of regulation, it is still drawing profit revenue from the CAA, as Dick Smith has pointed out in a letter to the Director of Aviation Safety Standards and Regulation which was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> earlier this week. In fact, $28 million in company tax was paid, and $15.2 million in dividend was paid to the federal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the CAA's all-up cost for the safety function of $60 million, the federal government contributes a maximum of $22.8 million from 1 July 1995&mdash;considerably less than its earnings from the authority. The federal government therefore profits from the regulation of the CAA to the tune of $20.4 million annually. This is, in my view, the equivalent of asking the police force to pay a dividend to the government. Mr Smith has argued that if the CAA and the government were in fact giving primacy to safety over commercial considerations, then a greater part of its earnings would be dedicated to its safety regulatory functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an even greater problem, however, because regulation and commercial considerations are as oil and water. It is the confusion of the two that has led to the current collapse of priorities in the CAA and to the virtual abandonment of regulatory rigour. The inertia is manifest when one considers the fate that has met the various recommendations regarding surveillance and audit in the organisation. The Division of Air Safety Standards and Regulation identified surveillance to the Terrell report in 1993 as a priority area. At point 2.11 the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a need to have a clearer picture of the effectiveness and adequacy of the surveillance undertaken by the Division. There is no ready means of obtaining a national analysis of the state of health of the industry. The lack of central control and guidance on implementation and surveillance matters was widely seen as a major deficiency.</PARA>
<PARA>It still is. It was a major problem in the Monarch case, it continues as a major problem in dealing with cases such as Yanda, and it has allowed cowboys to continue to operate with virtual impunity. At point 5 in the Terrell report, the division gave this assurance:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Surveillance plan to bring together in a coherent strategy the surveillance and auditing that will be undertaken in various sectors of the industry, the reporting and follow-up actions, including enforcement policies. The plan will be based on work already well advanced in the Division and will detail the process for national collection and analysis of data to be used to manage the surveillance program and to report to the CEO and Board. As currently planned, the new surveillance system will need to be implemented in July 1993.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet that surveillance system is still not in place today, almost one year after the division identified the urgent need. The progress on the surveillance system has become bogged down and, ironically, the computerised system that was previously in place has been abandoned. Despite repeated acknowledgments that a surveillance system is vital, it is still in limbo. It is obvious that the CAA needs drastic remedial surgery; this cannot wait. The Monarch crash was a tragic warning of what can happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of my contributions today, a month ago and in the future is to show that Monarch was not a `one-off': it is the tip of the iceberg. There are to this day, courtesy of the CAA, other airlines which flagrantly disregard good commercial practices, good maintenance procedures and good flying procedures, and which every day risk the lives of Australians who unwittingly buy tickets on their airlines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is beholden on us, as those people's representatives, to do everything in our power to ensure that aviation safety is maintained by acting immediately to cut out the rot that has taken over the Commonwealth's regulator, or policeman, of aviation, the CAA. There is no gain to be had for the government in protecting the CAA. The problem is so obvious and the interest so great that the problem simply will not go away. Every day that we delay the reform of the CAA is another day that we run the risk of one of the cowboy outfits driving a plane full of passengers into the side of a hill, as Monarch managed to do to my constituents one year ago this Saturday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Please, let us not delay solving the problems, whether they relate to insurance arrangements, the CAA or some of the airline operators themselves.

The government must initiate an investigation into the CAA now, with the specific task of reform of the organisation. Otherwise, we will all be back here in a year's time with an even worse problem and still more Australians having paid the ultimate price for the failure to get aviation safety regulation right, just as my constituents did a year ago this Saturday. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1994 is a bill that is not opposed by the opposition. There are three purposes to it: the change in the rate of duty for the imports of textile yarns; goods from Eritrea being given a concessional tariff basis; and the increase in the rate of duty on aviation fuels. It is on that latter point that I would like to spend just one or two minutes in this debate, because this particular piece of legislation is parallel to another bill that went through the House about a month ago, the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill. The basis of this bill was to be able to provide the Civil Aviation Authority with 50 per cent of the cost recovery process in providing safety services. May I just say that the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp), did flag a number of points that I was going to raise. Today I will not go through that and I will not go through some of the things that I think must ultimately be said, in light of your earlier rulings, Mr Deputy Speaker, on the sub judice provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is abroad a very real concern about what is happening with the CAA and what is happening in terms of the regulation and the provision of safety services in Australia. The honourable member for Hume raised a most salient point indeed, that is, just where we go in the provision of safety services, how far we take the cost recovery process, and whether we are getting to a stage where we are now going beyond the cost recovery process in those provisions. The point is whether there should not be a complete relook at the way we do administer aviation safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is true that people on my side of the Main Committee generally supported the concept of a user-pays principle for the CAA, but obviously the program that had been devised in New Zealand and, to an extent, in the United States has also had some very great difficulties, and those countries are now reviewing the situation as to whether or not that full cost recovery should be applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The analogy that was drawn a little bit earlier with what we do in terms of the police force was, I think, a fairly good analogy to make. The reality is that the safety division, in the administration of safety, is really a police force from the Civil Aviation Authority. If we are going to have the proper surveillance and the proper maintenance of our safety provisions in Australia, maybe we should relook at the way we provide those services. I hope that the government takes up the suggestion of a complete review of the CAA. As I said earlier, there is no doubt at all that there are some very real concerns about what is going on and a great deal of dissatisfaction with the whole area of cost recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The application of the new costs on avtur and avgas are only a very small part of the equation. If we look at what is happening overseas now, in terms of the CAA and the services that it can provide, we see that there are some examples of where it can make some money and where it can hive off some of its services, which would allow it to become very much a small regulatory body that sets up the standards; and we can still apply some of that cost recovery to that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that is being examined at the moment, particularly in the United States and now in the United Kingdom, is the privatisation of the provision of air traffic control services. There has indeed been some success there. If the government is worried about some of these costs, that is one area that could well be examined. Before air traffic controllers around Australia go into a state of seizure, let me say that one of the things that has worked overseas and has really got some attraction in Australia is the possibility that those air traffic controllers can very much become part of the companies that provide those air traffic services. The evidence that we have from overseas is that, when that happens, we not only get a much more efficient system of air traffic control but, because there is some sense of profit motive within the process, people become much more interested in the operations of air traffic control, and the nature of air traffic control is improved considerably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that the government, like its counterparts in New Zealand, the United States and the UK, should examine the possibility of that particular process.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, prior to the interruption I was talking about the real need for the government to look at the reorganisation of the Civil Aviation Authority. I was talking about some of the options that it may have in terms of reducing costs and increasing efficiencies in light of aspects of the Customs Tariffs Amendment Bill, which is all about providing 50 per cent of the cost of the safety contract. I was talking about the option of hiving off some of the present requirements of the Civil Aviation Authority to allow it to become a very small, lean, mean and efficient organisation that really sets up the policy and the administration of aviation in Australia, getting itself out of some of those areas which it need not be in and which could be provided more efficiently by private enterprise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think, though, at the end of the day the real decision that the government has got to make is: what is going to be the nature of safety administration within the Civil Aviation Authority? It would seem to me that, if the government is serious about providing the most efficient and cost-effective administration of aviation in Australia, one of the options that it should look at is having the CAA as a small regulatory body quite separate from that&mdash;a special division that would administer the safety aspects of aviation and one that was divorced from the commercial pressures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague the honourable member for Hume raised in his speech some of the problems that those commercial pressures bring. I think there is a real difficulty within the organisation as it stands at the moment. The feeling is that it must look after the requirements of commercial operators and that perhaps that can take some priority over the provision of the safety standards. I think that in any review we should look at having the safety division stand alone. That would have to be funded directly from the public purse if we were going to get over some of the difficulties that we have got here at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aviation industry always harks back to the days of Sir Donald Anderson. It was during that period that Australia probably led the world in the provision of aviation services; we had a tremendous reputation. The commercial reality is that those days have passed but there is still an opportunity for Australia to have the best aviation services in the world. I think that it would be a relatively easy thing to bring about. I would hope that, while the controversy still rages about how the funding of safety administration in Australia is going to be paid for, the government would grasp the nettle and make sure that it was a thorough examination. I would hope that it would look very closely indeed at being able to separate those particular divisions and would make sure that the safety administration stood alone as a completely independent body. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note in particular the provisions of this bill giving Eritrea status as a developing country. I applaud the government's move in this direction because the people of Eritrea have suffered enormously over many years now. They were being persecuted for a long time by the Ethiopian government. Tens of thousands of them were killed in war. Probably hundreds of thousands of them died of starvation. It is only right and fitting that the Australian people should in some way recognise them and in some way help them by giving them special status in terms of our tariff regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not normally agree with my great protagonist in the republican debate, Tom Keneally, but certainly I very much support and admire the work that Tom Keneally has done to publicise the plight of the people of Eritrea and to help them in their various difficulties. The fact that this bill applies the system of tariff preferences in respect of Eritrea provides me with the opportunity to make a few comments about the tariff issue. I do not intend to trespass on the chamber's time for any great period but it is important, in the light of comments that the government members keep making about this whole tariff question, to touch on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tariffs have a long history in Australia. The federation movement itself dealt with this problem. I suppose that tariffs have been seen in the Australian context as a way of building up infant industries and helping them come to maturity. The problem with tariffs in this country has sometimes been that these industries have moved from infancy to senility without ever passing through a period of maturity and development. Notwithstanding that, tariffs do exercise a fascination for the general public. In some polling in the United States recently, US citizens were asked to choose between, on the one hand, their country being twice as rich as it is now and the Japanese being twice as rich again, and, on the other hand, their country being no richer than it is now and the Japanese being no richer, so the relativities were preserved. They all chose to preserve the relativities rather than to go for absolute wealth increases if it meant that the relativities changed. So there is a great hold by tariffs on the popular psyche. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people regard this whole question as a bit like the injunction to love one's enemies. In an ideal world we would do it but in the real world it is very hard to do. Nevertheless, it is important that we continue to pursue a policy of tariff reform. Notwithstanding all these arguments in favour of industry protection, tariffs in the Australian context have not been very successful. For instance, in the clothing industry between 1971 and 1991, even though the effective rate of protection almost doubled, the actual employment almost halved. In the footwear manufacturing industry between 1971 and 1991, even though the effective rate of protection almost quadrupled, actual employment declined by a factor of four. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of these industries which historically have been heavily protected, such as TCF and motor vehicles, even though in the last few years the rate of protection has again begun to decline, have started to develop once more. My colleague the honourable member for Hume pointed out that the TCF industry has invested $600 million over the last three years, even though the effective rate of protection has begun to decline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tariffs are burdensome, they are cumbersome, they are difficult to comply with, and they involve very heavy bureaucratic costs. One of the provisions of the bill reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reference materials, being specimens of materials or substances, one or more of whose property values are sufficiently homogenous and/or well established to be used for the calibration of an apparatus . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is no wonder that tariffs are burdensome to the general community. It is no wonder that these things do, by and large, apply great extra costs to industry. Eventually these flow through to the exporting sector of our community. It is a little bit like sales tax, in the problems of differentiation between, for instance, strawberry Quik and chocolate Quik or between toothbrushes and toothpaste, on which sometimes sales tax falls and sometimes it does not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition policy on this whole question of tariffs has been somewhat misrepresented over the last couple of years. Our policy is to eliminate the rorts, the rackets and the rip-offs in the Australian economy. It is not to throw the textbook at every problem. At the last election, for instance, our policy was not zero tariffs; our policy was negligible protection by the year 2000. It did not mean no tariffs; it meant tariffs amounting to perhaps five per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An example of the flexibility in our policy was provided just before the election by the special deal we gave to the sugar industry. The policy that the coalition took to the last election was designed to reduce protection and at the same time change the whole structure within which industry was operating so that the net operating costs of industry would be significantly reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I contrast that with the general policy of the government to cut tariffs without at the same time establishing a lower cost environment in which industry can operate. In particular, while tariffs have been reduced steadily over the last few years, the government has not taken sufficient steps to deregulate the labour market, for the simple reason that the ghost at the cabinet table has always been the ACTU. The government's tariff reduction policy has, in effect, been a policy of unilateral economic disarmament. It has been a policy of inviting our competitors into a room to tackle our industries while both hands of our industries have been tied behind their backs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I invite the government to show the same faith in the Australian workers as it has shown in the Australian industrialists. The government has taken the shackles of tariffs off industry and is allowing it to compete more freely, without allowing the workers to do the same.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this bill there is a range of amendments with no central theme, but the amendments have underlying them some important policy issues and decisions. In a sense the devil is in the detail, but also the detail reflects some fundamental policy issues which have been at the forefront of this government's activities over the last 10 or 11 years. They can be summarised in three ways: firstly, ensuring that Australia becomes an internationally competitive country; secondly, pursuing micro-economic reform initiatives; and, thirdly&mdash;this relates in a sense to our international attitude&mdash;ensuring that we keep an eye out for developing countries less well off than ourselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Customs tariff is a duty or a tax levied on imported goods, in contrast to excise tariff, which is a duty or a tax levied on goods produced in Australia. So far as the particular amendments are concerned, there are four which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay) highlighted in the second reading speech and I will mention them briefly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first relates to Eritrea as a developing country. Honourable members would be aware that the Australian system of tariff preferences, or ASTP, provides preferential treatment to imports from developing countries. They receive a discount of five per cent off general industry assistance tariffs over five per cent, unless the general tariff rate is less than five per cent; and in such cases imports from developing countries enter free of duty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note the figures for our balance of trade with developing countries. In 1989, Australian exports to developing countries were $17 billion, representing approximately 36 per cent of total exports. By 1991, Australian exports to developing countries had reached $21 billion, representing approximately 39 per cent of total Australian exports. Imports from developing countries in 1989 were $12 billion, or approximately 23 per cent of total Australian imports, and by 1991 those imports had risen to $13 billion, accounting for approximately 26 per cent of total Australian imports. So, in a sense, despite the preferental treatment, the balance of trade is in our favour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the preference scheme is concerned, in March 1991, in the industry statement, Building a Competitive Australia, the government announced that the margin of preference for goods from Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the Republic of Korea would begin to phase out from 1 July 1992. Subsequently, in the course of last year, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced that developing-country tariff preferences would be modified for all but the least developed countries and South Pacific island territories. It is in that context that we see the addition through this bill of Eritrea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment to which I wish to draw attention is in respect of the changes to the tariff rate so far as avgas and aviation kerosene are concerned. Underlying these amendments is an effort by the government to ensure that the activities of the Civil Aviation Authority, particularly in its safety area, are cost effective. Previously we have seen before the parliament amendments to the excise tariff regime which reflect those changes. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), referred to the change so far as reference materials are concerned, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, in the course of his speech, referred to those changes made to textile yarns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of these amendments is very much reflected by the detailed policy arrangements or mechanisms that we find behind these measures. Before I comment on those policy measures, I think it is worth getting the revenue raising aspects of these measures in perspective. At page 4.224 of Budget Paper No. 1, in the indirect tax table, we find the sorts of revenue raising that are being referring to here. The 1994-95 estimate for customs duty is in the order of $3.2 billion. In relation to sales tax and excise duty, the sales tax estimate is $11.1 billion and for petroleum products the estimate is $9.7 billion. So, in customs duty, we are looking at a small proportion of the indirect tax that is raised. That amount has actually been falling over a period of time, and this reflects the underlying policy approach of the government. </PARA>

Mr Deputy Speaker, we are in a very civilised chamber and so I will not labour the point&mdash;if I can put it that way&mdash;but a commitment to zero tariffs is a commitment to zero tariffs. It was significant that the new Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), when allocating his front bench positions, decided that `Dr Zero', Dr Hewson, the person who absolutely committed the opposition to zero tariffs, would take the very important industry portfolio.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The general tariff rate will remain at a maximum of 5 per cent beyond 1996 and will make Australia's tariffs among the lowest in the world. The Government considers that this is an appropriate target for tariff reductions, and the clearly articulated schedule of changes provides certainty for these industries in developing business and investment strategies for the future.</PARA>
<PARA>And on following page it goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tariff and related arrangements for the passenger motor vehicles, and textiles, clothing and footwear industries, will remain fixed through to the end of the decade. They will be reviewed in 1996, with a decision taken in 1997 on arrangements to apply beyond the year 2000. The sugar tariff will remain fixed until 1995-96, with a review conducted in 1995-96 to determine levels for 1996-97 and beyond.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Developing Country Preferences will be phased out or removed for all but the least developed countries (including South Pacific Island Territories).</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, it includes Eritrea through this particular amendment. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This acknowledges the benefits these, and other countries, receive from Australia's unilateral tariff reductions.</PARA>
<PARA>And then, what in very many respects is the key point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the same time as tariff reductions have been taking place, our overall international competitiveness has improved by around 35 per cent. This shows that protection is only one element in the overall picture.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the key thing. It has been the effect of the government's tariff policies, combined with the effect of related policy, which has seen Australia change to an internationally competitive country. Australia has changed from being a country dependent on commodity prices, and the roller-coaster effect that that creates, to being a modern trading and industrial manufacturing country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not propose to go further into the detail the amendments that I have referred to, other than to make some additional points in respect of the increases in the rates of duties on aviation gasoline and kerosene. I said at the commencement of my speech that there were, in a sense, three policy issues which underlined the detail of this bill. One was turning Australia into an internationally competitive country, and I have referred to the tariff regime. The second one was keeping an eye out for the developing countries less well-off than ourselves; and that is reflected in the comments that I have made on our developing-country arrangements. The third was micro-economic reform, and behind the changes to the rates of aviation gasoline and kerosene are the important reforms that we have made in the aviation industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not burden the chamber or the parliamentary secretary, who is very keen to get to the next bill, with the changes that we have made to deregulate the aviation industry, but I make some comments about the cost recovery efforts that we have made to ensure that the Civil Aviation Authority's safety efforts are cost recovered. I think that one of the best places to find the policy arrangements in respect of this is in the 1993-94 budget papers. The 1993-94 Budget Paper No. 1, at page 3.149, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government announced its intention in the 1992-93 Budget to achieve 50% cost recovery of the CAA's safety standards setting and surveillance functions by 1 July 1995. The Government will continue to fund 50% of these costs up to a limit of $22.8m a year. Phased recovery of the balance of safety standards setting and surveillance costs from the aviation industry commenced from 1 September 1993. The CAA will achieve full recovery by 1994-95&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and that of course has been taken up in the recent budget&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">of the costs incurred in implementing safety standards.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said earlier, that effort is reflected in the changed arrangements that have been made through the excise tariff regime, and they reflect this government's commitment to micro-economic reform in an important industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those reasons I support the amendments before the Main Committee. They are, in very many respects, technical and detailed amendments, but behind them we find key areas of activity that the government has taken to the Australian community after successive elections: turning Australia into a modern industrial trading nation; making sure that Australia is internationally competitive; doing that in a sensible way; rejecting the zero tariff approach of the opposition; and, importantly, ensuring that part of our thrust to become an internationally competitive country is a series of micro-economic reforms, one of which is reflected by the changes made in the aviation gasolene and kerosene amendments in this particular bill. I support the bill. </PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendment of the National Measurement Act 1960</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>The objects of the National Measurement Act 1960 include establishing a national system of units and standards of measurement of physical quantities and providing for their uniform use. The National Measurement Act is administered by the National Standards Commission, a Commonwealth statutory authority established in 1950. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will amend the National Measurement Act by increasing the number of commissioners serving on the National Standards Commission, by giving the commission the power to invest its money and to provide financial assistance, and by making other changes of an administrative nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission currently comprises a chairperson, an executive director and six other members. The chairperson is usually an eminent scientist or technologist, while the members bring to the commission a great breadth of experience at a very senior level. These members represent high technology industry, CSIRO, consumer interests, the trade measurement industry, the National Association of Testing Authorities, trade measurement authorities and academia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A program evaluation of the commission was carried out between December 1991 and March 1992 by Dr Kevin Foley. He was chosen by the Evaluation Steering Committee, which comprised representatives of the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development, the Department of Finance, the Bureau of Industry Economics and the National Standards Commission. Recommendation 6 of the evaluation report dealt with expanding the skills, perspective and experience of the commission by increasing its numbers by two to a total of 10 commissioners. This bill implements that recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments allowing the commission to enter into contracts involving amounts up to $250,000 without ministerial approval, and allowing it to invest surplus funds resulting from cost recoverable activities, bring it into line with other similar government bodies. Provision of a granting power to the commission will enable it to make grants of financial assistance for purposes related to metrology. The amendments will result in one additional staff member at a total cost of $100,000 per year. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendment of the Patents Act 1990</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>The amendment to the Patents Act 1990 brings that act in line with recent amendments made to the Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973 by the Maritime Legislation Amendment Act 1994. The Seas and Submerged Lands Act now defines Australia's continental shelf by reference to the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, not the 1958 Convention on the Continental Shelf. Consequential amendments to other Commonwealth legislation were included in a schedule to the Maritime Legislation Amendment Act 1994. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendment of the Pooled Development Funds Act 1992</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the amendment to section 24(5)(b) of the Pooled Development Funds Act 1992 is to extend the period for which the most recent audited accounts can be used to determine the value of the total assets of an investee business before a pooled development fund, or a PDF as it is sometimes known, invests from 12 months to 18 months. This change reflects the fact that audited accounts for the previous financial year are generally not available for up to six months into the current financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently section 24 of the Pooled Development Funds Act specifies that the size of the investee company at the time of the initial investment by a PDF must not exceed $30 million in total assets. Section 24(5)(b) requires that the audited accounts, used to determine the value of the total assets of the investee business, must relate to a period that ended not more than 12 months before the investment is made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment of the period from 12 months to 18 months in section 24(5)(b) permits, where necessary, the use of the investee company's most recent audited accounts to determine the value of the total assets. At present PDFs are prevented from investing in investee companies for, typically, up to the first six months of any current financial year, because audited accounts for the previous year are not available. The other timing constraints of section 24(5) remain unchanged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment to the Pooled Development Funds Act 1992 will have no impact on Commonwealth expenditure. A detailed explanation of the changes made by the bill is contained in the explanatory memorandum. I commend this bill to the Main Committee. I move:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) has been contracted by the Department of Human Services and Health, under </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Hospital Access Program to implement the development, collection and publication of accurate, comparable and timely data on waiting times across different areas and specialties. The first comprehensive national waiting list report will be published late in 1994 following the development arrangements for the provision of comparable national information with State and Territory health authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March 1994 the AIHW released an interim report, using available (but inconsistent) data.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the data presented in the interim report is to be interpreted with care. While the estimates for the number of patients on public hospital waiting lists have been made for Australia, the underlying data are incomplete.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of data reliability will be addressed in the national report as the States will have agreed with the AIHW on standard definitions, collection processes and data sets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Under the Medicare Agreements the States and Territories are required to provide comparable national waiting list data to the Commonwealth. However, there is a wide range of practice in the administration of waiting lists based historically on individual hospital management practices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth has funded a number of projects through the Hospital Access Program to assist hospitals to reform waiting list management. Most States and Territories now have policies in place that require hospitals to maintain elective surgery waiting lists that are regularly monitored and updated, acknowledging the importance of hospitals knowing the full extent of all doctors' waiting lists. In some States, it is now a matter of policy for hospitals to obtain full lists from their doctors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some States, doctors have been instrumental in the development of standard clinical urgency ratings for patients requiring elective surgery. This approach will help to shift the focus from the total numbers of patients on waiting lists to numbers of patients who are waiting inappropriately according to their clinical urgency. This will assist the Commonwealth and the States to identify and measure the real magnitude of the waiting list problem and to better target resources.</PARA>
