<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I present the committee's report, incorporating two dissenting reports, of the committee entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The 1993 federal election</EMPHASIS>, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QF4">Mr CONNOLLY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The 1993 federal election</EMPHASIS>, which is the committee's inquiry into the conduct of the 1993 federal election campaign and matters related thereto, has been tabled as an interim report in June on the present inquiry entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial reporting by political parties</EMPHASIS>. The government has now responded to the interim report and has recently introduced legislation to implement most of its recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report that I have just tabled records the findings of the committee on the criticisms and proposals for change that have been submitted to the inquiry based on the experience of the 1993 federal election. This covers all matters that were raised with the committee other than some aspects of election funding and financial disclosure which we intend to deal with in a further report, once we have had the benefit of the AEC report on funding and disclosure which is expected early in the new year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee is able to make a positive report on the operation of the electoral system and its administration by the AEC. The AEC provided an improved level of service at the 1993 election at a lower cost, in real terms, to that in 1990. The use of revised polling place strategies and the adoption for the House of Representatives scrutiny of the two candidate preferred count virtually eliminated problems experienced at the 1990 election with queuing at polling places and slow results. The result of the House of Representatives election was predicted at a very early stage on election night. In our report we have recommended further improvements to the conduct of the two candidate preferred count. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report recommends refinements to many areas of the electoral system. Most of these proposals have the support of the whole committee. However there are differences of opinion on some matters of policy. My opposition colleagues and I have recorded dissents on several issues. The majority have concluded that changes to the existing enrolment procedures are not necessary because there is `no objective evidence of widespread fraud'. The opposition members believe, however, that this conclusion is too complacent given evidence to the committee which revealed cases of multiple voting. We are also concerned that under the existing procedures there are opportunities for irregular and incorrect enrolment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Procedures to register as an elector are much less stringent than are required to open a bank account, register for social security or obtain a driving licence. Accordingly we have added a dissenting report recommending that individuals claiming the right to enrol should be required to provide the AEC with proof of identity and evidence of age and citizenship by production of a birth certificate, passport or certificate of naturalisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee is, however, agreed that the integrity of the electoral rolls is of central importance to the functioning of the system and acceptability of the electoral outcome. We would like to see a move away from the present arrangements which rely on a blitz on enrolments through habitation review just prior to an election. A better system would be one based on continuous roll review. In the view of myself and my opposition colleagues on the committee this would also obviate the need for the electoral rolls to remain open for seven days after the election has been called, which is when many new enrolments and changed enrolments occur without any opportunity for checking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition members of the committee also believe that there should be a move back to the old system of electors voting only in their electoral subdivision on polling day as we believe that division-wide ordinary voting potentially facilitates multiple voting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report makes various recommendations to help electors in remote locations. However, the government members of the committee have not gone as far as we would go to assist postal voters in remote areas. These voters are regularly disenfranchised because infrequent mail delivery means that they cannot return their ballot papers in the time allowed for  postal voting. The procedure used for most state and territory elections is to send to general postal voters in remote locations&mdash;that is, 20 kilometres from a polling place&mdash;ballot papers rather than postal vote application forms as soon as an election is called. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our dissenting report, we recommend that the Commonwealth should adopt this procedure. However, government members have qualified their support for this eminently sensible proposal by restricting the right to those general postal voters living 100 kilometres or more from a polling place, thus creating two classes of remote postal voters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report acknowledges the importance of electoral education by recommending a public education campaign to improve electors' understanding of how preferential voting works. However, we do not support the majority in the continued retention of section 329A of the Electoral Act, which makes it an offence, punishable by six months imprisonment, to advocate anything other than a full and consecutive preferential vote for the House. We believe this heavy-handed provision is a denial of free speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We of the opposition also believe that the provisions of the Electoral Act requiring truth in political advertising should be restored. Again we are joined in this by the Australian Democrats and the Western Australian Greens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government members of the committee have taken the opportunity to reduce the minimum nomination period to a highly marginal five days in order to reduce the minimum election period from 33 to 28 days. If adopted, the reduction in the nomination period will cause serious administrative difficulties, as we note in our dissenting report. There is no justification for the proposed reduction in the minimum election period. This proposal favours the government which is in the position to prepare for an election and launch it before opposition parties can fully prepare or, for that matter, even be aware that an election is in the offing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition members of the committee have also used the occasion to affirm in our dissenting report our opposition to the concept of compulsory voting which, as well as being inconsistent with the notion of democratic freedom, has led to other evils, including pressure to oversimplify the electoral system by the introduction of devices to make voting easy, such as ticket voting. These devices diminish the value of the franchise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also oppose the recommendation to extend the franchise to those undergoing sentences of imprisonment for serious offences. We believe that this is morally wrong, as the punishment of a person who has committed a serious crime against society should include suspension of the ordinary privileges attached to citizenship such as the right to vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to thank all those who made submissions to the inquiry and appeared as witnesses, in particular the officers of the Australian Electoral Commission. I thank the committee's secretary, Mr Donald Nairn, the research officer, Mr Russell Chafer, the administrative assistant, Mrs Helen Fyfe, and the other staff who served the committee during what has been a long and drawn-out inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the committee, I also take this opportunity to note our particular appreciation of the high quality advice from the Electoral Commissioner, Mr Brian Cox. We thank Mr Cox, who has recently announced his retirement, for his distinguished service as the Commonwealth's most senior electoral officer and for the support he has given to this committee during his period in office. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5V5">Mr STEPHEN SMITH</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Perth)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), the Deputy Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, has outlined the thrust of the committee's report. I wish to concentrate on that area which the honourable member for Bradfield has concentrated on; namely, the dissenting report. I will do so very briefly. The thrust of the dissenting report is found on page 153 of the report, which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Chapter Four of the report the majority concludes that changes to the existing electoral procedures are not necessary because there is no "objective evidence" of widespread electoral fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that this conclusion is too complacent given the evidence to the Committee which indicates cases of multiple voting (see paragraphs 4.2.4 and 4.2.8). We are also concerned that under the existing procedures there are opportunities for irregular and incorrect enrolment.</PARA>
<PARA>This assertion needs some careful analysis. The most appropriate starting point is the second paragraph of the report at page 1, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As at the close of rolls 11 339 849 electors were enrolled to vote.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say that an additional 9118 electors who turned 18 years of age before the day of the election subsequently enrolled. So there were over 11 million persons enrolled to vote. The report goes on to say that over 95.77 per cent of eligible voters did vote. So at the last election in 1993 over 11 million people were enrolled to vote and over 10 million people actually voted. In chapter 4 of the report we find the conclusion, which is based on the objective evidence presented to the committee, that there was no evidence of electoral fraud. The key paragraphs are paragraphs 4.24 to 4.28, which refer to detected cases of multiple voting. Paragraph 4.24 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There were 14 172 . . . letters sent out in 1993.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, about 14,000 letters were sent out to those people whom it was believed may have engaged in multiple voting. It further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of the replies, 7173 revealed cases where the name of an apparent non-voter could be matched with the similar name . . .</PARA>
<PARA>So, of the over 10 million people who voted out of over 11 million enrolled voters, there were 14,000-odd cases of possible multiple voting, with 7,000 apparent obvious explanations. The report comes to the conclusion, based on the AEC evidence, that of the entire number of cases of possible multiple voting 188 actually were referred to the Australian Federal Police. So, of the over 10 million people who actually voted out of over 11 million enrolled voters, 188 cases were referred to the Federal Police as a result of possible multiple voting. So what is at the heart of this dissenting report? It is not sustained by the objective evidence. The heart of the dissenting report is found in a paragraph on page 153, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current arrangements stress the obligation which proceeds from compulsory voting. We propose that compulsory voting be abolished so that the franchise again becomes the valued right of the free citizen in an open society.</PARA>
<PARA>So the dissenting report, which is supported by those opposite, is basically a call for the abolition of compulsory voting. Why are those opposite calling for compulsory voting to be abolished? It is not backed up by any of the objective evidence; it is backed up by what they believe in. After the 1992 Liberal Party state conference in Western Australia, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> in August 1992 contained an article entitled `Plan to end forced voting', which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Liberal Party's annual state conference yesterday backed the call to end compulsory voting in state and federal elections.</PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to refer to the president of the Canning division of the Liberal Party in Western Australia, Mrs Ricky Johnston, who has been a candidate for the seat of Canning on two or three occasions. The article states that the president of the Canning division, Mrs Ricky Johnston, said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A compulsory system meant "dregs of society" got a say whereas with voluntary voting only those who were interested actually cast a vote.</PARA>
<PARA>Those opposite actually believe that those people who vote against them are `dregs of society'. The real complaint in the dissenting report is that they lost the election. They think they lost the election because their so-called `dregs of society' are actually entitled to vote. Let us look at some proper, decent analysis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We only have to go to an article by Gerard Henderson in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of Tuesday, 15 November to find out why those opposite lost the last election and why their so-labelled `dregs of society' vote against them. Henderson is the historian of those opposite. His book which I have here entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Menzies' Child: the Liberal Party of Australia: 1944-1994</EMPHASIS> should be read by those opposite; its analysis is worth more to them than the standing committee's dissenting report. The article written by Henderson is entitled `Outdated Liberals out of tune with the voters'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly most of Alexander Downer's wounds are of the self-inflicted variety. However, in this he is not alone. Every Liberal leader in the last dozen years has made at least one terminal political error&mdash;including Malcolm Fraser . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Henderson then goes on to make the key point:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than contemplating yet another leadership change, the Liberals in Canberra should be focussing on what are the cultural and organisational reasons for ongoing political failure. In his lively critique <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Is The Party Over?</EMPHASIS> . . . Christopher Puplick argues that "Australian society and the Federal Liberal Party are no longer moving in the same direction or at the same pace".</PARA>
<PARA>Henderson then goes on to illustrate a range of reasons why that is the case. The opposition ought to concentrate on bringing itself into the modern Australia and not try to pretend that there is widespread electoral fraud when there is not, and not try to pretend that people vote against it because, as it labels them, they are `the dregs of society'. The opposition should understand that the real problems highlighted by its dissenting report are reflected by the fact that it is an outmoded, outdated, irrelevant institution in Australian society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I commend to everybody&mdash;the press, the public and honourable members&mdash;this excellent report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The 1993 federal election</EMPHASIS>, which contains some very interesting reading on the electoral system in this country. It has been past practice on both sides of politics to try to agree, as much as possible, on the content of reports. As we can see from the presentation of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), it has been difficult to do so from the coalition's point of view on this occasion, and we have a rather lengthy dissenting report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of severe time restraints, I will limit my comments to one particular section. Paragraph 6.4.1 on page 94 relating to general postal voters states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Electors who live more than 20 kilometres from a polling place can register as General Postal voters.</PARA>
<PARA>The register is reviewed at least once every 18 months, and it concerns only about 9,500 voters&mdash;less than one-tenth of one per cent of the Australian voting population. When an election is called the procedure is for these people, if registered, to be automatically sent postal vote application forms. If they are on a weekly mail service, they receive the forms, fill them in, sign them and send them back. Ballot papers are then sent out to them. They fill those in, sign them and send them back. Once the ballot papers have been received, the signature is checked against the application for registration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people receive only one mail service a week. This government has just knocked back an Industry Commission recommendation that people in remote areas should get at least two mail services a week. If for some reason they miss their weekly mail service&mdash;it has rained and the roads are cut or they are out mustering&mdash;they cannot get their vote in. Paragraph 6.43 in the body of this report in regard to voting states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this poses no problem for electors with regular mail delivery, there are electors in remote areas who are regularly disenfranchised by the current procedures. At present, the period between close of nominations and polling day can be as few as 22 days. In many remote areas of Australia the turn-around time for mail can be a week or more, meaning that the process of receiving and returning a postal vote application, and then receiving and returning ballot papers, can take up to a month&mdash;too long in many cases for electors in remote areas to have their votes counted.</PARA>
<PARA>What is this government going to do? It is going to reduce the minimum election period from 33 days to 28 days, which means that many more of these people will be disenfranchised. There were 10 submissions, out of 152, put to this inquiry that were particularly concerned with this point, including a submission from the Electoral Commission itself and the electoral commissions in Western Australia and the Northern Territory. This government, I am sad to say, has ignored that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a solution. Paragraph 6.44 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AEC and others submitted that the best solution would be to adopt the practice of some State and Territory electoral authorities and automatically send electors in remote areas their ballot papers when an election is called. This would remove two steps . . . and would thereby give remote General Postal Voters more time to register their votes with the AEC. Such a reform would have the added attraction of eliminating confusion caused by differing State and federal procedures.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say that a precedent does exist because there are general postal voters, by virtue of being infirm and unable to sign documents, who automatically receive ballot papers when an election is called. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory, people over 20 kilometres from a polling place who are registered are automatically sent voting papers. As the AEC has said, there has never been a case of fraud identified yet from that system. In fact, the integrity of the system is higher than that of a normal vote because the signature is checked off against one on an application form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All we have now is confusion between the states and the federal government. This committee has made a recommendation that we have two categories of registered postal voters, which I think is a recipe for disaster. A recommendation of the AEC states that the introduction of such a proposal:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . .  would continue to adversely affect registered general postal voters in remote areas . . . would also be likely to add to voter confusion by introducing another difference between federal and State voting procedures . . . would appear to be a retrograde step . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It also says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence from the Northern Territory strongly supports the proposition that the distance of the elector's residence from a polling place or mobile polling station is not a relevant factor in an elector's access to sufficiently frequent and dependable mail services.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the situation is exacerbated if electors are working (eg mustering) during the election period and miss the consignment of mail in their weekly service . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Again the relevant issue is the frequency of the mail service. The AEC goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From an administrative viewpoint, there would no longer be&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>if we brought ourselves into line with the states&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the need for the current double-handling process of issuing a postal vote application followed by a postal vote certificate when the required declarations have already been made in applying for general postal voter status. The adoption of such a proposal would also achieve estimated savings of around $40,000 in the overall cost of an election.</PARA>
<PARA>So there is overwhelming evidence that such a recommendation should be made. Yet this government has made an outrageous and  stupid recommendation, deliberately ignoring the advice of the AEC, and is cynically misusing the electoral system to disadvantage country voters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;There are only a couple of matters that I wish to raise in speaking to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and they involve the compulsory system of voting and full preferential voting. They are two concepts and two principles that I wholeheartedly support. I believe we in Australia have one of the best electoral systems in the world. We have one of the best participation rates in the world as far as the general public is concerned. I will quote some figures concerning the last two elections later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the second report I have participated in which comments on the results of elections. After I was elected in 1990, I was a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters which commented on the 1990 election, where there were some problems with queuing. The committee made a number of recommendations in relation to that matter and other matters. There is no doubt that that improved the electoral process for the 1993 election. The problem of queuing was largely overcome, amongst other things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the dissenting reports in this report are really based on policy considerations. I believe we have a system that can withstand scrutiny and a system of the utmost integrity. I think that is shown in the closeness of the last election and in the fact that that result has been widely accepted. It was a result in which the electorate participated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we compare the 1990 election with the 1993 election, we see that, in 1990, 10,225,800 people registered first preferences for the House of Representatives. That is 95.32 per cent of eligible voters&mdash;an outstanding participation rate by the community. That was increased in 1993 when 10,900,861 people voted&mdash;95.75 per cent. Again we recommend a continuing education program by the Australian Electoral Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must compare that participation rate with the participation rate in America or in the United Kingdom where only about 50 per cent of the voter population turns out. In a close election result, you could get a party forming government that has only about 25 per cent of the voting population voting for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leads to problems. My theory is that it leads to other forms of protest such as riots and people not accepting those in power. By having a compulsory system of voting we are encouraging people to participate and to come along and register their protests through the ballot box rather than through some other means. That is one of the reasons this country has a stable political environment and that there is a general acceptance of the voting system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Voters can certainly come along and register an informal vote if they want. What happened in the last two elections is that people exercised greater caution and tried to register a valid vote. In 1990, the number of informal votes was 3.19 per cent of those who voted, whereas in 1993 the number of informal votes came down to 2.97 per cent. I think that says something. It shows that there is an acceptance of the compulsory voting system and people are trying to get it right in picking their candidate. If people did not agree with compulsory voting they would come along and register an informal vote and we would see the informal vote skyrocket as a form of protest. That is not what has happened. In recent campaigns, the number of informal votes has been coming down. That is a good thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that is important is the full preferential system of voting. It enables people to register a protest with a minority party and then come back to the mainstream parties. We do not have the situation that is developing in the United Kingdom and that will develop in other countries where they have a first past the post voting system and they get parties forming government when they have only 35 per cent or 40 per cent of the vote. Here people can register a vote for a minor party and it comes back to the mainstream parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Normally, the party with more than 50 per cent of the vote is elected to government. With some minor exceptions that has occurred. One notable exception was the failure of the Whitlam led opposition in 1969, which received well over 50 per cent of the vote, to obtain government. Those sorts of quirks in the system can happen. That situation is not going to be enhanced by having non-compulsory voting or optional preferential voting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My message to the parliament is that this examination of the last election shows that we can certainly refine the system around the edges to try to encourage more people to vote in a formal manner and to assist them to vote&mdash;and we are talking particularly of rural Australians, people from Aboriginal communities, and remote Australians. This report shows that there is a bit of ignorance out there in the community and there are the occasional redneck radio commentators who try to impugn the electoral process and run their own agendas. When the system is put under the microscope it comes up trumps. This report shows that we have a good electoral system. I commend the report to the parliament. Again, it highlights how we are leading the world when it comes to the conduct of elections. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Mr Speaker, I welcome the fact that you are in the chair during this significant debate on a matter that is fundamental to democracy in Australia. I wish to make a brief speech about the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I have some very fixed views on the issue of voluntary voting. The report reminds us that fraud was not a significant factor in past elections. I believe that is probably true simply because there is a compulsory system of voting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a bit disappointed that the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) decided to pick on the evidence of an individual person who said that one side of politics might be a little less intelligent than the other. There is no evidence of that. I do not subscribe to that theory. It is not that many years ago that in Western Australia we had voluntary voting in the upper house. It was the Liberals who changed that. One reason we did that was that there was fairly good evidence that Labor voters could be better organised to attend to the polls than Liberal voters and compulsion was a policy that was of some benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I served for 16 years in Western Australian local government where, of course, as in most states, voting is voluntary. Quite often you find that getting people to vote is an extremely difficult issue. I might add that I used to achieve a voting turnout of 80 or 90 per cent because everybody came out to vote when I stood&mdash;not always for me; there were those who had a commitment to voting against me. That points to something in the system: if you have a sufficiently controversial candidate, you will always get the voters coming out in number. I was rather proud of that&mdash;that I never ever won an election uncontested, and usually there was a large group opposing me. I used to like the fact that I always won. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having made that point, I wish to make a couple of remarks about the system, particularly in response to the remarks by the member for Perth, who I thought might have avoided the opportunity to have that little dig. There will always be people who make those sorts of digs. He has been a state secretary of the Labor Party, and I am just giving him a little dig back. I remind him that there is an old saying: vote early, vote often. That in itself can be used as a criticism if we choose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, as to the extent to which fraud might exist even at this time, we are now in the arena of data processing and databases. For instance, any political party wishing to corrupt the system which can get hold of a list of members of a religious group which currently, today, is classified as a conscientious objector&mdash;its members refuse to vote&mdash;can use those names to vote, without any severe risk of being caught. I have heard stories of how, in the old days of local government, there would be candidates with a truckload of suits out in the back room; certain people would come in, swap a suit and vote, and then come back in, swap a suit and vote again. Nobody has been able to tell me, in fact, that that did not occur&mdash;and we have opposite another spokesman who has had a bit of background in or may still have connections with local government. Those are the issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once we move to a voluntary system, it will not take long to establish a database on people who regularly do not vote. If you wish to move in that direction, there will be an obligation to give people some form of identification&mdash;which I think the American system has&mdash;where you have to prove who you are. Nevertheless, I believe that, because of changing times and the fact that political parties, if they choose, can obtain information on people, as I said, who might be conscientious objectors, a situation exists even today where we are very close to the need to have some form of identification of a person's right to vote. Of course, I am an adamant opponent of the type of identity card that has been proposed, not on the basis of its nature as an identity card but because of how some people have proposed using it. That is the great downside of those sorts of things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In confronting this issue, my grave fear has always been the potential for fraud. Whilst one could argue who might do that best, in the end both sides would be in it. It would be a very unsavoury situation and one in which I would prefer not to participate, having always said in this place, `You make the rules, I'll play the game.' But, on the other hand, we can avoid that in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of my colleagues would disagree with me. I understand all of the other arguments. I often say to people in my party that, when one talks about commitment to vote, I recognise the grave apathy which there is in our party and in the Labor Party, but I recognise the lack of it in the lunatic fringe. I worry sometimes that, through the absolute commitment of the lunatic fringe and the apathy of others, we may find the wrong sorts of people representing our interests in places such as this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, in closing, I make a comment on preferential voting. I always had a reasonably open mind on preferential voting until I heard a lady make a statement on the radio one day. She said, `I, as a supporter of a major party, get one vote; all the supporters of minority parties get two or three.' I guess you can attack the logic of that in various ways. But it is a fact that, as you vote for some of the minority parties, you find yourself in a situation where you are actually allowed to second-guess. I thought that was restricted to the quizzes of the ABC. However, that is an issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I had to choose between voluntary voting and preferential voting, if one had to go, I would let preferential voting go. I am not convinced that it gives us good government. It might be time to put down a minimum primary vote for the Senate. Such a requirement is not unusual. The South Africans decided on that just recently in writing a brand new constitution. I just cannot understand why, when someone needs 35 per cent of the vote to win an election under a first-past-the-post system, we let control of the Senate rest with people who have been elected with a two per cent primary vote that is built on by picking up all the scraps left when quotas are filled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a bit inclined towards winner take all, to tell the truth. It is time the major parties had a look at that. I do not think they ever will, because in the end they would rather see somebody with a very small political base running the country in an effective way. My view is that we might be better to say that one has to get a minimum primary vote in the Senate before one can participate in the distribution of preferences. That is an issue people should look at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would rather the government had the right to pass some of its more silly legislation, because I am sure it would get us into government a lot quicker. In fact, we so often save the government from itself that it is not funny. If one looks purely at the operation of government, there should be every opportunity for those who win the House of Representatives to win the Senate, if they can; but certainly we should not have the Senate controlled by people who have no seats in the House of Representatives. Then, as I said, the people would get the government they deserved. In that situation I would advise people very strongly always to vote for us because they would get much better, much more mature and much more sympathetic government, particularly from me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I apologise for that levity at the end of my contribution. I think this matter is very serious.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Racial tolerance is an essential part of any civilised community. In a multicultural nation such as Australia, it must be an essential part of our values, our aspirations and the laws of the nation. The Racial Hatred Bill is an effective safeguard against extreme acts of racial intolerance. It amends the Crimes Act to make it a criminal offence to threaten physical violence or the destruction of property because of the victim's racial background. The bill also amends the Racial Discrimination Act to allow the victims of humiliating or intimidating racist behaviour to complain to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. This civil remedy involves, in the first instance, conciliation but, if that fails, the possibility of compensation orders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill fulfils Australia's international responsibilities under the 1966 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Article 4 of the convention obliges parties to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . declare an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred, incitement to racial discrimination, as well as all acts of violence or incitement to such acts against any race or group of persons of another colour or ethnic origin . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate removed this provision from the Whitlam government's Racial Discrimination Act 1975. Since then, both sides of the chamber have promised to either restore the provision or not oppose its restoration. Sometimes in politics, however, progress takes a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the final days of the last parliament, the government introduced the Racial Discrimination Legislation Amendment Bill, which lapsed at the 1993 election. I am delighted that the government, through the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), has now brought to the chamber this legislation to ensure that racial violence and racial vilification are outlawed in each of the states in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is indeed landmark legislation. It represents an important landmark in Australia's transformation from an inward looking, monocultural society to an outward looking, tolerant, confident, multicultural society. Speaker after speaker in this debate has praised the way in which Australia leads the world in the 1990s in tolerance and multiculturalism. That much is absolutely true, but I would like to place this debate in an historical context through an understanding of how in Australia tolerance and multiculturalism has not always been a feature of our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last century and in the first half of this century, Australian society displayed some of the most unacceptable features of monoculturalism and racial intolerance. Those of us who understand that history will appreciate the need to be vigilant in this nation to make sure that those values of Australian tolerance and egalitarianism are expressed in a multicultural society in the fashion envisaged by this legislation. I refer members on both sides of the House to Elaine Thompson's excellent social history of Australia, published earlier this year, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fair enough: egalitarianism in Australia</EMPHASIS>. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia had an egalitarian cult. That much we know and take for granted, yet there are paradoxes and contradictions within the cult that have gone unacknowledged and unexamined. Australia's egalitarianism was about much more than social manners. Part of it involved the simple idea of sameness. It portrayed Australians as a homogeneous people, whose dominant characteristic was that they were British. From first white settlement Australia was committed to `Anglo' values, interests, institutions and  cultural perspectives. That egalitarian sense of sameness had profound effects, both positive and negative. It helped democratise Australia's political system but it also created the White Australia Policy . . . It also suppressed and denied the diverse cultural heritage of many Australians . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It is now an unhappy recorded fact of Australian history that for decades&mdash;indeed for more than a century&mdash;Aboriginal people in this nation were the subject of consistent racism, abuse and occasional genocide. It is now an unhappy recorded fact of our history that in the 1870s the gold rush produced enormous racial violence towards and vilification of Chinese people in Australia. The antipathy towards the Chinese was to flourish beyond the goldfields. They were resented, threatened and bashed. On occasions they were massacred. It is now, unhappily, a recorded fact of Australian history that even in this century the wave of Australian migration was accompanied by acts of racial violence and vilification against southern European migrants after World War II. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even after the time of the Federation, Australians saw themselves as a white island continent, isolated in the Pacific from the rest of the white race and constantly under threat from non-whites. This produced a whole range of xenophobic features within our national institutions and national laws. Indeed, one of the first acts of this parliament was to institutionalise racist immigration policies in the White Australia policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first official census conducted soon after Federation claimed falsely that 98 per cent of Australian inhabitants were British or of British stock. This myth of Anglo-Celtic racial homogeneity in Australia was perpetuated for more than 50 years. At the beginning of this century and for decades that followed, Australian politics and Australian institutions were geared around this idea of an inward looking, monocultural society that brought with it some very unfortunate features of racial violence and racial vilification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is an important landmark in Australian politics and Australian social history because it says that Australia no longer regards those sorts of attitudes and forms of social intolerance and racism as acceptable. We are  embracing in the 1990s all the best values of tolerance and multiculturalism. With this bill the government is providing an effective safety net that entrenches those values and  attitudes in our society, offering a safeguard to people who may be the subject of racial violence and racial vilification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the historical perspective, I note that even my own party, in this matter, is not without fault. The fact that Australia is a multicultural society in the 1990s is the product of post-World War II migration. But even that migration program was inspired by a fear of isolation and a fear of Australia's place in the world. In 1947 the Labor Minister for Immigration, Arthur Calwell, announced that Australia had `25 years at most to populate this country before the yellow races are down on us'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was the attitude that underscored the migration program leading to Australia's tolerant multicultural society in the 1990s, but it has taken a very important transformation of our values to bring it about. For so much of our history, Australian egalitarianism in our social mannerisms was expressed with an inward looking monocultural focus. But we have been very fortunate in the 1970s, the 1980s and now the 1990s&mdash;through legislation, changes in social attitude, education programs and all the tolerance and understanding of our society&mdash;to turn this focus around into the tolerance and outward looking confidence of multiculturalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This landmark legislation builds on this achievement and entrenches those values into the statute books of the Commonwealth. It recognises that it is part of Australia's laconic and easygoing character and an expression of our egalitarianism to have these forms of racial tolerance. Most Australians do not pass judgment or express intolerance on the basis of race, colour, creed and culture. Yet a small minority of racists and racist organisations do express and seek to incite racial intolerance and hatred. We need to be vigilant in these matters, understanding the racial intolerance, vilification and violence of a small minority in Australia and also understanding that, in the broad sweep of Australian history, there have been some unfortunate characteristics of racism that at one time held the majority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia in the 1990s, we do not have Le Pen or the re-emergence of the fascist movement that has been seen in recent years in Europe. But we do have the League of Rights and we do have in election campaigns organisations, such as the Australians Against Further Immigration, which run their campaigns on a racist platform. There is a by-election campaign now under way in the division of Kooyong, vacated by Andrew Peacock, where unfortunately the Australians Against Further Immigration are using as their first plank and platform the racial background of the Liberal candidate. This is a shameful piece of Australian political behaviour. It is shameful by anyone who practises it. It is shameful by anyone involved in that campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had an experience in the Werriwa by-election earlier this year when the Australians Against Further Immigration contested that campaign. These people distributed blatantly racist material, trying to link migration with some of the worst health problems in Australia and targeting certain racial groups to serve their own prejudices and play on some of the worst fears and insecurity of a minority in the electorate. Happily, they were easily defeated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three major reports since 1991 have highlighted the need for vigilance and legislation against racial hatred in Australia. The first was the report of the National Inquiry into Racist Violence by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, published in April 1991. It found that racist violence, including intimidation and harassment, remains a problem for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; that racist attitudes and practices pervade some Australian institutions, both private and public; that racist violence also occurs on the basis of ethnic identity; and that the existence of a threatening environment is the most prevalent form of racist violence confronting people of non-English speaking backgrounds simply because they are visibly different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The report was followed by the findings of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, which was also released in 1991. It recommended that governments legislate to proscribe racial vilification and provide a conciliation mechanism for dealing with complaints of racial vilification. The third report was in 1992 by the Australian Law Reform Commission on multiculturalism and the law. The majority of the commission also supported making racial vilification unlawful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These three reports confirm the need for vigilance, a safeguard and a safety net to be placed in the statute books of the Commonwealth. It is to the Attorney-General's credit that he is acting on the reports, understanding that there is still in Australia a minority which engages in racial violence and racial vilification. Indeed, last night in debate, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) provided recent instances in his electorate of acts of racial violence and vilification against the Jewish community. We need to be vigilant in all these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliament also needs to understand two important issues in this debate. The first concerns states rights. It is better to have laws against racial vilification in some parts of Australia than nowhere in the nation. Nonetheless, it is inconsistent and inadequate that the rights of Australians under such laws should vary from state to state. This can never be left as a question of states rights; it is a national responsibility of this parliament and government to enact laws to prevent racial violence and vilification in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Racial vilification does not depend on where people live. Racial vilification can cross state boundaries. Invariably in the electronic media it does. For that reason, these responsibilities cannot be left to the states. They need to be acted on by the national parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Racial vilification has been illegal in New South Wales since 1989, in Western Australia since 1990 and in Queensland and the ACT since 1991. A racial and religious vilification bill was introduced by the Kirner government before the last Victorian election, but it has not been revived by the Kennett government. There is no law against racial vilification in South Australia, Tasmania or the Northern Territory. This bill covers the gaps. It produces national consistency where it is needed most to provide a safeguard, entrenching the values of tolerance and multiculturalism in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue, which has been raised frequently by opposition members during this debate, is the question of freedom of speech. The High Court recently established an implied constitutional guarantee of free speech but also ruled that at times free speech should be restricted for the greater public good. That is, there is in Australia, as with every other country, no unrestricted right to say or publish anything regardless of the harm it may cause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have laws in Australia against defamation and obscenity. There are broadcasting regulations, consumer protection laws and criminal laws about counselling others to commit a crime, all of which can be seen as restrictions on absolute freedom of speech. The only institutions in this country that have absolute freedom of speech are the parliaments of the nation. But outside the parliaments, as a product of the laws of those parliaments, there are restrictions on absolute freedom of speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A restriction against incitements to racial violence and vilification is totally valid to ensure not so much absolute freedom of speech but fair speech, consistent with the values of tolerance and understanding. Presently in Australia, if someone incorrectly claims in public that you are a thief and a liar, the law allows you to sue that person and claim compensation for the harm caused by those words. However, if someone uses words to inflict or incite racial hatred on you, in some states the law offers no protection or source of redress. This bill overcomes that inconsistency. It provides a safety net for racial harmony in Australia as both a warning to those who might attack the principle of tolerance and an assurance to their potential victims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no absolute freedom of speech in Australia because of those other restricting laws. This is a provision for fair speech, consistent with proper Australian values in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is most unfortunate that opposition members do not acknowledge these facts. It is very unfortunate to see the backdown by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) on this matter&mdash;a backdown to appease rednecks in his own party and the National Party. On 26 June this year, published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Jewish News</EMPHASIS>, the Leader of the Opposition had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where there is incitement to violence or to damaging property on the basis of race, then there's no question that should be a criminal offence.</PARA>
<PARA>If he really believed what he said on 26 June, he should be supporting this legislation and ensuring that the coalition parties give it unanimous support in this chamber. It is a nonsense to say that opposition members support absolute freedom of speech when, consistently, they recognise the need for defamation and obscenity regulations and consumer protection laws in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a political fix of the worst kind by the opposition and its leader&mdash;selling out principles of tolerance to sort out a political problem for the coalition, caving in to the people whom this week in the national media the Leader of the Opposition called the right-wing freaks and right-wing fringe dwellers in his own party and the National Party. No leader of a party should ever cave in to right-wing freaks and fringe dwellers. The problem for the coalition is that racism is part of the culture of the Liberal and National parties. National Party members of parliament use racist language in and around their electorates. That is no secret in this parliament. We need only go to the words of the leader of the National Party in New South Wales, Ian Armstrong, who at a rally in Queanbeyan on 29 January 1988 had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We've got to get rid of crime, drugs, hoons and coons.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of language leaders of the National Party use in public debate at public rallies. It is the sort of language that is very common among National Party and redneck Liberal Party members in their electorates. They traffic and trade in racism around their electorates to put down the rights of Aboriginal people and put down the rights of anyone who challenges their old-fashioned attachment to homogeneity on racial grounds, the old-fashioned style of a monocultural Australian society. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For you it is the Adelaide Club test, so pass that one.</PARA>
<PARA>We have a range of vilifying comments from the Prime Minister&mdash;the one person who has been touting himself around the country as being somebody who is bringing Australia together, particularly through the introduction of this legislation. He is trying to pass himself off as someone who is going to protect particular communities within the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) that, in stark contrast to the ALP, the federal Liberal and National parties are totally opposed to racism of any form, wherever it rears its odious head. It should not be an issue in any way. In particular, racism should not be a means of putting one side against another to obscure the points being made by members in the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian community as a whole, including those Australians of overseas origin from non-English speaking backgrounds, know this full well. The coalition, in contrast to the ALP, has a record second to none in this area. It was Harold Holt's coalition government in March 1966 that abolished once and for all the White Australia policy&mdash;a decision which enabled the welcome inflow of so many people from such a wide range of ethnic and racial backgrounds, and since then including people from Asian nations particularly, especially China and Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This nation is blessed with one of the most diverse, tolerant and cohesive multicultural societies on earth. The Prime Minister's Racial Hatred Bill is a political stunt which could damage the fabric of our society by encouraging intolerance and confrontation between different sections of the Australian community, particularly those from non-English speaking backgrounds. These sections of the Australian community along with all Australians rejoice in the freedom of speech, thought and expression that is an integral part of our vibrant democracy. The coalition will have no part in threatening or curbing these fundamental underpinnings of the Australian way of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's decision to oppose the Keating Racial Hatred Bill was taken after full consultations with leaders of a wide range of ethnic communities. Those consultations revealed, quite rightly, a widespread concern that the government's bill was unnecessary, divisive and potentially counterproductive to social cohesion, tolerance and diversity and that the draconian racial hatred legislation of the nature proposed by the Prime Minister is not the right course for Australia. They reject strongly the notion that people can be gaoled for expressing their opinion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me point out to the members opposite that many of  these people came to live in Australia precisely to escape those very concepts. Many came during times of great oppression and suppression of freedom of speech in their former countries. One of the things they found so inviting and attractive about this nation was its tolerance&mdash;the ability of people to express themselves, obviously within the parameters of a decent society, that expression of freedom of speech being protected at law. There is a fundamental difference, as we all acknowledge, between expressing an opinion, however odious, and threatening violence to personal property. The latter has always been and remains totally offensive and unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the aspects of this bill that is of concern is that it may well risk the right of sections of our community who have come from overseas countries of origin to continue their often vigorous rejoicing in their cultural history and heritage and the debates that arise from them. Rallies, for instance, by Greek, Cypriot, Turkish, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Burmese, Tibetan, Chinese, Albanian, former Yugoslavia republic, Arabic, Indian subcontinent and African communities could become subject to prosecution under the bill. Even the use of historic symbols, insignia or flags could become subject to prosecution. Certain clergy, for example, Jewish Greek, Buddhist, Maronite and Islamic, could also face the risk of prosecution in certain circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without exception ethnic communities in this nation believe that widespread multipronged educational strategies are of the highest priority. Education attacks the cause of racism; legislation does not. The coalition totally shares this view. For this reason we have announced that the coalition will support a $10 million education campaign. The full details of this campaign we finalised after extensive consultations with ethnic communities. The coalition has already benefited from discussions with several of the larger communities. The campaign will be directed towards schools  and other education institutions and the wider community. Amongst other things, the campaign will enable community workers and community leaders to better assist their members resolve racial incidents and understand their rights, particularly for recently arrived older migrants of non-English speaking background. The campaign will also address the extensive ignorance and lack of understanding of ethnic communities in Australia that exists in various quarters, particularly in some sections of the Australian media. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to look at exactly what this bill does. The bill has two parts: it contains criminal provisions which allow people to be sent to prison and it contains civil provisions which allow a person who objects to a racist remark to take the person who made the remark to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. In both parts of the bill it is quite clear that the government has gone way over the top. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the introductory summary, the government bill goes much further than is necessary or appropriate to combat racial harassment or than is needed to send a message to the community that such conduct is unacceptable. We in the coalition will prepare our own bill after appropriate consultation. Unlike the government, we will not go over the top with respect to the provisions contained therein. Our bill will not be extreme. It will not provide a criminal sanction for otherwise free speech. As I mentioned, we will commit $10 million over two years to a community education campaign to promote awareness and tolerance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer particularly to the criminal provisions. Proposed section 60 of the bill is a fundamental denial of the right to free speech. It establishes a new class of offence which impacts upon expressions of opinion rather than expressions of violent intent. Such an incursion is objectionable and unwarranted. We on this side of the chamber will not support a criminal sanction for expressing a view and encouraging others to adopt it when you are not inciting people to damage property or persons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To create an offence of inciting racial hatred without linking the incitement of damage to personal property makes it an offence to try to get other people to agree with your own view. An offence is committed even if there is no urging of other people to act in a violent way on that view. This is a most serious and inappropriate infringement of free speech. The coalition again does not believe that a person should be put in gaol for encouraging others to adopt a view, however violent or racially prejudiced that view may be. Supporting laws that restrict what people say, even where the vast majority believe the remarks themselves are offensive, undermines our democratic system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I looked through the provisions of the various sanctions contained within the bill and tried to see exactly where current statutes in my home state would fail to be of use or to redress the situation. In proposed section 18C(i) of the bill, under the heading `Offensive behaviour because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin', the offensive behaviour contained therein would be quite easily prosecutable under the state police act, for instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to proposed section 58 under the heading `Prohibition of threats to cause physical harm because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin'. That quite clearly would be contained in the offence of threatening behaviour, which is relatively easy to prosecute. In the prosecution, one would merely need evidence to show that there had been race, colour or national or ethnic overtones in whatever discussions, threats or otherwise were contained in the offence. In the case of prohibition of threats to property because of race, colour, or national or ethnic origin, in my state section 80 of the Police Act would cover that, as would the more serious provisions contained in the criminal code. In reference to proposed subsection 60(2), I am interested to learn from the parliamentary secretary exactly why an offence committed in private was excluded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia&mdash;I think the previous speaker, the honourable member for Werriwa, referred to this&mdash;amendments were passed by the state parliament in 1990 which amended the Western Australian criminal code and which outlawed the possession or publication of material to incite racial hatred. It brought in punishment of two years gaol for offenders. Possession or display of material to harass a racial group also became an offence, with offenders facing up to a year in prison. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What that effectively means in the case of my state is that there are no clear reasons for the enactment of an overlaying federal legislative framework because the state legislation quite easily deals with all of those provisions. I might add that there have been no prosecutions under Western Australia's criminal code amendments, but the minister, Mr Kierath, has pointed out quite rightly that the legislation plays an important role within Western Australia&mdash;it has an educative function. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the legislation in its current form is necessary if for no other reason than it sends a clear signal to people about what is acceptable and what's not.</PARA>
<PARA>He pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You must remember that most laws rely on the fact that most people will obey the law and not break it.</PARA>
<PARA>We have also been told&mdash;and I mentioned it earlier&mdash;that our nation does have a very good record of multicultural harmony and tolerance. Most of the supporters of multiculturalism, of which I am one, have cited this as being one of the fundamental reasons why multiculturalism is an effective policy in the case of Australian society. It seems somewhat illogical that, at the same time, others are saying that because of this there ought to be legislation introduced to prosecute or create criminal sanctions against racial intolerance or bigotry and threatening and other racially based behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through my reading of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> on the Racial Hatred Bill, I have found that it deals with the meaning of `hatred'. Rather than rely on my views, I will quote the views of the Parliamentary Library:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As noted above in the Background, the international instruments which form the constitutional support for this bill avoided reference to `incitement to racial hatred', on the basis that hatred is too subjective a term for a court to assess. In the United States and Canada, concern has also been expressed that the term `hatred' is too uncertain a standard to include in penal legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">State v Klapprott</EMPHASIS> the Supreme Court of New Jersey that a statute that made it an offence to utter any statement inciting hatred, abuse, violence or hostility against a group by reason of race, colour, religion or manner of worship, was void for uncertainty, because the terms `hatred', `abuse' and `hostility' are abstract and indefinite. Chief Justice Brogan concluded that it is not possible to say when ill will becomes hatred. He noted that there is no norm to say when such an emotion comes into being, and that it cannot be made a legitimate standard for a penal statute.</PARA>
<PARA>So here we have a problem already in the drafting of the legislation, where we are going to find it is difficult to determine what is racial hatred. As has clearly been shown in the above quote, there is a difficulty in concisely defining exactly what racial hatred means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect of the matter which has been raised by the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) is the problem created by relying too heavily on the explanatory memorandum for the purposes of further defining the offences within the act. In his address yesterday, the member for Tangney gave a very concise but full criticism of the problems inculcated by the over-reliance on the explanatory memorandum in relation to the application of the bill. In the few seconds remaining to me, I will give one example of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the training guarantee levy, the explanatory memorandum was different from the bill. Constituents of mine were who were trying to assess their liabilities under the training guarantee levy, relying on the explanatory memorandum, came up with one figure; they were then told by the authorities that that figure was not correct because the act provided for a different set of criteria in assessing the liabilities under the act. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The handling of these negotiations over both the Government's Racial Hatred Bill and the Coalition's proposed alternative race hate bill has seriously undermined the efforts of the Coalition at building relations with ethnic communities.</PARA>
<PARA>There are other headlines about the opposition leader's  perilous status in his own party, but this I think indicates the great difficulties the opposition has with this bill and other bills in relation to human rights. We saw this issue replayed earlier with the privacy bill in relation to gay rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Opposition members are saying that they will oppose this bill because it is flawed. If it is flawed, as they argue, they are perfectly entitled to put up amendments. They are not putting up amendments; they are going to write their own bill. This is really to placate the internal dissent within the coalition parties, in my view. The Racial Hatred Bill is a matter of real concern to many in our community. I commend the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) on his excellent historical account of racism that has been part of this country's xenophobic monoculturalism and has infected all political parties. I do not think any member of this House would walk away from that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us just see what the opposition leader said a very short time ago in relation to racial vilification. The member for Werriwa has previously referred to an article in the Sydney edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Jewish News</EMPHASIS> of 24 June. Having said that he supports criminal sanctions&mdash;I want to repeat that so there is no misunderstanding&mdash;the Leader of the Opposition said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"Where there is incitement to violence or to damaging property on the basis of race, then there's no question that that should be a criminal offence.</PARA>
<PARA>The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Downer&mdash;who has described himself as an unambiguous opponent of discrimination on the basis of gender, race, religion or age&mdash;finds the League of Rights' antisemitism and attitudes on race abhorrent. "I did have some League of Rights groups in my electorate at one stage," he said. "The redistribution, I think, has largely taken them out; but I haven't heard much from them because they never regarded me as a friend at court and so that was it."</PARA>
<PARA>That is fascinating because subsequently there were many reports and electronic media replays of the opposition leader's attendance at meetings of what could only be described as fellow travellers and supporters of the League of Rights. Here again, I unfortunately I have to say that the opposition leader's views were dependent on the context in which he was uttering them. When he is being interviewed by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Jewish News</EMPHASIS>, he is supporting racial hatred laws; when he is not, he is saying something else. That is the problem&mdash;the lack of real policy commitment from the opposition. Suddenly, out of the blue, we have $10 million worth of education. That is fine and all very well, but it does not deal with the core issues of racial hatred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real controversy is over the relative balancing of the rights of free speech and the rights of people to live without fear of racial harassment and violence. I want to refer to an article from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quadrant</EMPHASIS> magazine written by Isi Leibler in which he quotes Professor Kathleen Mahoney from Canada. It goes to the point that the member for Moore was making a little earlier. In the article Professor Mahoney is quoted as observing that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . non-violent hate . . . exists on a continuum which eventually and inevitably leads to violence once the weapons of segregation, disparagement and propaganda have done their work.</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Mahoney in a recent speech is also reported by Isi Leibler as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Modern democracies that respect equality and multiculturalism have accepted as a fundamental principle that legislative protection and government regulation are required to protect the vulnerable. To use the free speech doctrine as an instrument to permit disadvantaged or vulnerable groups to be seriously harmed by more powerful groups misunderstands the proper role of governments and free speech . . . Governments must speak on behalf of those who cannot be heard, to facilitate the expression of their ideas and to promote the interests of tolerance, pluralism and individual autonomy. All constitutions in free societies embody this concept by permitting limitations on speech activity if those limitations are justified, reasonable and prescribed by law in the democratic context.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that goes to the core of the concerns about this bill. Certainly, there have been many high profile critics of the bill. Therefore, it is encouraging to see that we are having a full debate on this matter in the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to speak about the victims of racial intolerance. I want to refer to reports of racist incitement against Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people contained in the report of the National Inquiry into Racist Violence in Australia by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner, under the chairmanship of Irene Moss, the Federal Race Discrimination Commissioner, and Ron Castan QC. No-one would disagree that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have been subject to racism in this country. This did not happen in the distant past; it is happening right up to the present day. In the report the commissioners talked to many people right around this country. Page 76 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There were also complaints of violence and intimidation by non-Aboriginal people who attacked particular Aboriginal communities. The Aboriginal settlement on the outskirts of Mareeba (northern Qld) had been subjected to visits by car loads of youths in the early hours of the morning shouting racist abuse and throwing bottles. The submission from the Townsville Aboriginal and Islander Legal Service noted that Aboriginal people in camps at Charters Towers had their property burnt and destroyed by non-Aboriginal persons (allegedly security guards) in early 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Katherine (NT) the Aboriginal community was frequently the subject of verbal abuse by non-Aboriginal youths. In Alice Springs there were complaints that Aboriginal people were being `terrorised' by groups of whites. Such incidents involved the alleged rape of Aboriginal teenage girls, and alleged poisoning of Aboriginal men in which five people died and the dousing and painting of Aborigines.</PARA>
<PARA>These are only a few of the many reports of racist attacks against individuals and communities. It is very important that we understand the issue from the perspective of the victims. This was the position of Dr Nguyen Trieu Dan, the President of the Vietnamese Friday Club in Melbourne, who has also written a book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Vietnamese family chronicle: twelve generations on the banks of the Hat River</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Dan is also quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quadrant</EMPHASIS> magazine of November 1994. Reporting on a seminar at which he had spoken, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I mentioned that in my fifteen years or so in this country, I had experienced three fairly bad instances of racial abuse, one of which was a threat of violence.</PARA>
<PARA>He says that that was in contrast to many, many positive experiences of welcome Australians. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet I did not remember the good experiences as clearly as the bad ones.</PARA>
<PARA>He refers to the proverb `Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me' and says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A broken bone can be treated and mended . . . but racial abuse can leave a mark for a long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any discussion of racial vilification laws should primarily focus on the victims.</PARA>
<PARA>He refers to a survey of 630 year 11 and year 12 students in Melbourne working class suburbs in 1993&mdash;the previous year&mdash;by the Department of Psychiatry, Melbourne University. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of one hundred Vietnamese refugee students in that group, 69 per cent said they experienced racism at school, 59 per cent experienced it in the streets and 14 per cent said racism involved physical threat or injury. As a result of such experiences, some of the students suffered from loss of sleep, others felt "nervous and shaky inside", some said they panicked in crowds and some even thought of killing themselves. According to the research team, 15 per cent of the Vietnamese surveyed could face serious long-term psychological damage.</PARA>
<PARA>These are very important issues. As Dr Dan says, this is in a society that prides itself on giving everyone a fair go, a society where the mainstream majority experience tolerance and pride themselves on living in a tolerant multicultural society. But if we do not listen to those people who are on the receiving end of intolerance and racism, we will not understand the reality of people's lives in Australia. As Dr Dan says, this affects not only the victims but society as a whole. As a society composed largely of immigrants from many parts of the world, Australia's cohesion depends on the ability of all&mdash;indigenous Australians as well as settlers&mdash;to integrate and be committed to the idea of a multicultural nation. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Commitment to a country", to quote a Vietnamese lady on her experience here, is often a "tentative and incremental process. Like a transplanted seedling, it needs time and tender loving care to take roots and grow. Acceptance and encouragement strengthen it. Rejection and rebuttal make it wither."</PARA>
<PARA>He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Racial intolerance results in particular groups in society feeling isolated and rejected. It creates disunity and alienates the victims from the mainstream Australian society. Most of all, it implies that not all people are of equal worth or deserve to be treated equally.</PARA>
<PARA>These are very important issues. The bill attempts to address them and to plug legal loopholes that do not provide, under existing legislation, the same sorts of rights that we in the mainstream of Australian society&mdash;that is, the Anglo-Celtic mainstream&mdash;are used to receiving. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> of 8 October, Dr Colin Rubenstein addresses the issue of free speech. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The absolute idealised right of free speech generally cited does not exist anywhere and never has. No one, in any country, has the right to express whatever they want wherever they want to. To give just a few examples, defamation laws, incitement laws, obscenity laws, false advertising laws, and broadcasting regulations all temper both the contents and the form speech and expression can take. Why? Because there are vital public interests or important private rights at stake, which outweigh the minor curbing of free speech involved.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a very important issue that, unfortunately, we will have to address in a democratic multicultural society. I think it is very important to note that in other states in this country this issue has been taken up. I refer to Chris Puplick, President, Anti-Discrimination Board of New South Wales. On 4 November he responded to an editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 1 November.

<PARA>To the argument that criminal sanctions are rarely used, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that there have been no prosecutions in NSW is not evidence of any failure of our laws but rather evidence of the success of the laws and the Anti-Discrimination Board in conciliating complaints.</PARA>

Chris Puplick goes on, in responding to Father Brennan's criticisms of the Racial Hatred Bill, to say that Father Brennan's criticisms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . fail to recognise the enormous impact of the adoption of racial vilification legislation as a powerful statement of public policy&mdash;namely, a declaration by the people's elected representatives that racism will not be tolerated where it promotes hatred, violence or community division.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The experience of NSW, well tested over five years, is that appropriately drawn racial vilification laws provide the basis for public education to eliminate racism; allow conciliation to take place to the benefit of all parties; does not impede free speech, create martyrs or drive people underground; makes a clear declaration of our public policy and provides ultimate sanctions which ought to be available in any society where respect for the rights of individuals and their protection together with promoting tolerance and social cohesion are among our highest and most noble goals.</PARA>
<PARA>I think the words of Chris Puplick, who after all fell foul of the Right of the New South Wales Liberal Party and allowed for the entrance ultimately into this House of the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), indicate just how far the Liberal Party has moved to the right on these issues. It is very disappointing that on this bill, as on many other issues of human rights&mdash;the privacy bill, the Mabo legislation, the land acquisition bill; there is a litany of bills of great importance to this country's democratic status, our international commitment to conventions that we are signatories to&mdash;the Liberal-National parties once again are divided and cannot form a clear position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested that the alternative bill to the Racial Hatred Bill will never see the light of day because it is simply there to deal with divisions in the Liberal Party that the current Leader of the Opposition has no stature, authority or leadership to deal with. That is to the detriment of this country and its democratic principles. I support the Racial Hatred Bill. I hope that it will not only pass through this House but also find support in the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I work on a number of committees, and I work on one particular committee in this place with the previous speaker, the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell). I think we have a common view on a number of issues and we have a common concern about some of the problems in our communities around the country. Therefore, I was somewhat disappointed with particularly the opening part of her speech in which she was very clearly trying to play politics with a matter that I think is very serious; that is, the subject of racial treatment of people in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My intention is to treat the matter seriously and in its own right. I want to start by perhaps defining some of the problems as I see them from my own experience and some examples from elsewhere. I want to go on and examine the Racial Hatred Bill and look at what it actually does in its main provisions and comment briefly on each of those sections. I want to look at one of the major aspects of the government's justification for introducing the legislation and explain why I think that justification is wrong. I will then examine briefly the views of one or two outside experts in the area of race relations. Finally, I will explain why, on balance, I came to oppose this legislation, although I believe that somewhat less draconian legislation based on the New South Wales model may be appropriate if a major education program is unsuccessful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me start by just giving the House a very brief experience of where I am coming from. My first wife was Chinese and we were married for 30-odd years. My children are Eurasian. I can assure honourable members that through my working life we personally suffered&mdash;my wife, my children and me&mdash;from a number of racial comments and discrimination in one form or another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within a matter of weeks of my first being elected to this chamber in 1990, my office in Melbourne was daubed with anti-Asian slogans because of my then wife and my children. At the local railway stations people handed out anti-Asian and anti-Nugent leaflets. The police were somehow inexplicably unable to catch these people. They said to me that if they did catch them they were not sure what they could do about it. So I have some personal understanding of what it is like to be on the receiving end of racism, although obviously not personally as much as those who are non-Anglo-Saxon. Clearly, that is where most of the attacks occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to read in yesterday's paper an article by Mr Ron Castan QC who was co-commissioner of the 1991 national inquiry into racist violence. He said in his article:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some weeks ago, a man in a passing truck in Doncaster, in Melbourne's eastern suburbs, screamed at Dr Harry Cheong (not his real name), who was standing at the side of the road: "Why don't you go back to China, you f . . . ing wog!" A large gob of spit then landed on Dr Cheong's suit. The doctor recorded the vehicle's details.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The doctor, who has been an Australian for 20 years, came here from Malaysia after medical training at the University of Singapore. He has saved numerous lives and helped thousands of fellow Australians back to good health. He is much loved by his many close friends, of whom I am one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Harry asked me what he could do about this event. I told him that technically the spitting might be a form of assault. The language might amount to a breach of the Summary Offences Act of Victoria, which makes it an offence to use "threatening, abusive or insulting words" in a public place. But the present law provides him with no real redress that deals with the demoralising effect it had upon him. He decided not to pursue the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Harry is a well-established professional with a large group of relatively influential friends. Each time he tells someone his story they express horror and regret, and reinforce their support and friendship. His faith in this country is still solid. But I know that we let him down. Not just because of the ugly racism of a truckie in Doncaster, but because our system does nothing for him. And there are thousands of victims of this kind of street racism in our communities.</PARA>
<PARA>Ron Castan then goes on to argue in support of the legislation. It would be unfair of me not to make that point. He concludes by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most Australians believe in tolerance. Justice and good government demand that our laws make it clear that racial hatred is un-Australian. And people such as Dr Harry Cheong are entitled to protection from the spitting truckies who shame us all.</PARA>
<PARA>I quote that particular incident because it seems to me that we have to understand that, whilst it may not be necessarily a widespread problem or even a growing problem&mdash;that is hard to quantify&mdash;there are undoubtedly in this country daily instances of racism which are hard to deal with and which cause great suffering, humiliation and hurt for many people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the bill to see whether some of those matters will be addressed. My complaint about the legislation is that it is flawed and ineffective and will not actually deal with the problem. I acknowledge that the Parliamentary Library's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> is an excellent document in this respect. It takes the act and technical terms apart fairly well. There are offences that deal with threats. It is proposed that the Racial Hatred Bill amend the Crimes Act 1914 by inserting a new part&mdash;`Offences based on racial hatred'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This part contains three criminal offences, two of which concern threats of violence. One is the proposed section 58, which provides that it is an offence to threaten to cause physical harm to a person or group because of race, colour, or national or ethnic origin. The penalty is imprisonment for two years. The proposed section 69 provides that it is an offence to threaten to destroy or damage property because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin of any other person or group. The penalty is imprisonment for one year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is already an offence to threaten to cause injury to people or their property in Australian states and territories, although in some jurisdictions the laws are limited to specific types of threats. In many cases, the penalties are higher in the states than are the penalties provided in the Racial Hatred Bill. If a person were to threaten to destroy or damage the property of somebody else in New South Wales, under the New South Wales legislation he or she would be liable for imprisonment for five years. If, however, the threat was motivated by racial hatred and prosecution was commenced under this legislation, that person would be liable for imprisonment for only one year. This discrepancy between the penalties, it seems to me, runs the risk of giving the impression that racially motivated crimes are treated less seriously than crimes committed for other reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third item under this particular heading of the Racial Hatred Bill proposes another amendment to the Crimes Act, inserting section 60, which provides that it is a criminal offence to do an act which is reasonably likely to incite racial hatred. This offence contains several qualifications. The first is that the act must be done otherwise than in private. This phrase is partially defined in the proposed subsection 60(2) which notes that an act is not done in private if it is done in a public place or within sight or hearing of people in a public place or is communicated to the public through words, sounds or images. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, words painted on the wall of a private house which can be seen from the road could be subject of an offence, but conversations within the house which cannot be heard from the street outside would not be an offence. It is less clear whether meetings of racist organisations would fall within the description of acts done otherwise than in private. The offence does not require that there be actual incitement of racial hatred. There is no test of causation. Accordingly, a person may be convicted of an offence even if no person has been incited to hate on the basis of race. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, however, two tests of intention which must be met. The first test is a subjective test, which requires it to be established, according to the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt, that the defendant committed the impugned act with the intention of inciting racial hatred against another person or a group of people. It must also be established that a substantial reason for doing the act was the race, colour, or national or ethnic origin of the person or group against whom it was intended to incite racial hatred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second test is an objective test. It must be proved that the act is reasonably likely in all the circumstances to incite racial hatred against the other person or group. The term `racial hatred' is not defined in the bill. So one might assume that `racial' was intended to cover colour or national or ethnic origin. But this is not explicit at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tests of intention have caused some difficulty, as has been said by others in this place, in other countries, such as the United Kingdom. One problem is that it often depends upon the people to whom the act is communicated&mdash;in other words, the audience of a speech or the readers of racist material. If the people at whom the act is directed are unlikely to be incited&mdash;that might even be members of parliament or others who are being lobbied on a particular issue&mdash;or if the intention of the act is to get them to support a change in policy, then, no matter how offensive the words, an offence would not have been committed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we turn to the civil offence of offending people on the basis of race. This bill proposes to amend the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 by inserting a new part: `Prohibition of offensive behaviour based on racial hatred'. Contrary to its title, the part does not make any reference to racial hatred. The proposed section 18C provides that it is unlawful to do an act which is reasonably likely to `offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate' another person or group if one of the reasons for doing the act is race, colour or national or ethnic origin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with the criminal offences proposed in section 60 that I have mentioned, the act must be done otherwise than in private. The definition is the same as that in the criminal section. The proposed section 18C does not contain a subjective test of intention. The person doing the act does not have to intend to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate the other person. It is enough if one of the reasons for doing the act, and it need not be the dominant reason, is the race, colour, national or ethnic origin of the other person or people. The main test is the objective test that the act be reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another person or group. There is no requirement that any person actually be offended, insulted, humiliated or intimidated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed section 18D sets out exemptions to this particular provision. These exemptions are meant to cover things that are said or done reasonably and in good faith in relation to things like artistic works; genuine academic, artistic or scientific purposes; discussion or debate on a genuine purpose in the public interest; fair and accurate reports of any event or matter of public interest; and fair comment, representing a genuinely held belief, on any event or matter of public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed section 18E provides that an employer is liable for a breach of the proposed section 18C made by one of his or her employees, when it is done in connection with the employee's duties, unless the employer can establish that he or she `took all reasonable steps to prevent the employee' from doing the act. How draconian do we have to get?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill refers to acts which are reasonably likely to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate a person. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission expressly recommended against such a low threshold as would allow complaints for hurt feelings or injured sensibilities. The word `offend' is defined in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Macquarie Dictionary</EMPHASIS> as meaning:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to irritate in mind or feelings; cause resentful displeasure.</PARA>
<PARA>The problem with using terms such as `offend', `insult' and `humiliate' is that they are largely subjective in nature. The courts of the UK have had trouble interpreting the word `insult' in relation to public order legislation, and there have been similar problems in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn briefly to one of the government's main justifications for introducing this legislation. The explanatory memorandum that attaches to this bill opens by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill makes provision in relation to racial hatred by amending the Crimes Act 1914 to provide for three criminal offences and the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 to provide for a civil prohibition. The Bill addresses concerns highlighted by the findings of the National Inquiry into Racist Violence and the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. In doing so, the Bill closes a gap in the legal protection available to the victims of extreme racist behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA>This is simply not the case. It is a misleading statement. During the period of 1991-92, three reports were written which touched on the question of national racial vilification. The Australian Law Reform Commission, in its report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Multiculturalism and the law</EMPHASIS>, concluded that incitement to racial hatred and hostility should be made a civil offence which is dealt with by conciliation. The commission rejected making it a criminal offence, noting that this would unduly restrict free speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commissioner Elliott Johnston QC, in his report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, also recommended a civil offence of the kind existing in New South Wales. He supported conciliation as a means of dealing with racial vilification, but rejected the use of criminal sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, in its report of the National Inquiry into Racist Violence in Australia, recommended the creation of a civil offence of incitement to racial hostility. The commission stressed that the threshold for prohibited conduct must be higher than expressions of mere ill will or conduct which results in hurt feelings or injured sensibilities as this can lead to a large number of trivial complaints, as has occurred with similar legislation in New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The commission rejected the view that incitement to racial hostility should be a criminal offence. We have a number of other examples of that sort. The government has said that it is introducing legislation based on these sorts of reports, which are downright misleading if not that other word which we are not allowed to use in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to briefly refer to Father Frank Brennan, who is well known in this country as being very active in the Aboriginal affairs area. Father Brennan, who is very supportive of Aboriginal causes, is a legally trained man. He has done major work for the government in a number of different areas. He would be considered one of the more respected people in the Aboriginal community by those who deal in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that Father Brennan is also opposed to this legislation. He says that the law will not serve the purpose for which it is intended. He argues that there is already a sufficient body of criminal law that is capable of dealing with the worst consequences of racism. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"The major concern I have can be summed up by asking the question, what activity that is not now criminal will be rendered criminal by these laws?"</PARA>
<PARA>I ask the same question. Brennan says that motivation can now be taken into account by courts when sentencing. He says to accept the argument that tougher penalties mean making a judgment that violence against one group in the community is worse than violence against other groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of incitement to racial hatred or generalised threats, he suggests that the difficulty of establishing evidence would mean little prospect of successful prosecutions. He lists several other reservations, including the risk of making martyrs of racists by sending them to gaol, and fears the laws might be used as a weapon to inflame inter-ethnic rivalries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case against racist laws is strengthened by the fact that versions of these laws introduced in New South Wales in 1989 and Western Australia in 1990 have not yet resulted in a single prosecution. Given ongoing concerns about racist violence, it seems that proponents of the legal remedies are unable to explain why. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this speech, I have not dealt with the general subject of free speech because I believe that the bill fails on other counts, and time is against me. My view is that no Australians support racist words or actions that involve threats to injure or damage people or property. No citizen should have to live in fear of such threats or tolerate people who incite others to make such threats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be that milder legislation than this might be appropriate on the New South Wales model, but my view would be very much the one articulated by Ron Merkel QC, who is a former president of the Victorian and Australian Council for Civil Liberties. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing in our national experience suggests that silencing evil has ever corrected it . . . to eradicate racism we need to listen to the words which are expressed, to delve beneath them, to find our own words of reply and explanation, before we can even begin to make the changes we seek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, for those who defend the right to such speech the lesson is clear. Those who seek to protect the rights of racists to express their views have a corresponding duty to expose those views for the evil that they represent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is through the process of exposure and education rather than prohibition that we can achieve a tolerant and understanding community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislative path against racial vilification has not been shown to be successful elsewhere and </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">there is no reason to believe it will be . . . in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree. Education and conciliation are the way to go. The law, based perhaps on the New South Wales model, may have a place in our overall armoury to combat racism, but this bill is fatally flawed and should be rejected. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to dwell at length on the contributions of other members. I do not want to treat this in a partisan fashion because, in my own electorate and many like it, the issue is so fundamentally important that at the end of the day it is necessary for this country that the opposition review its attitude. I do not think that, from the government side, much would be gained on this basic issue by point scoring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the contribution of the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) does cause some legitimate concerns. He builds sandcastles and windmills by saying that people might accuse him of being racist and that he might be taken as being politically incorrect. I do not want to enter the competition he suggested as to whether he goes to the most diplomatic parties and the most ethnic functions on Saturday nights and whether people have been overseas to ASEAN countries as often as he. Whilst he accuses others of stereotyping him as a racist, his own analysis of why people are bringing forward this legislation is equally partisan and mischievous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the National Party speaks of social engineering and agenda setters. He puts in the words of those who endorse this legislation a preoccupation with being manipulated by outside experts, by essentially a professional elite that has no real knowledge of the issues. However, the reality is that, whilst the Leader of the National Party can come into this House and talk about how when he goes out in the electorate or when he is at a meeting he would treat people who make racist remarks as ratbags, that is not the real world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This problem does not exist in nice debates at Oxford University or Harrow or Eton public schools. Many people cannot handle this degree of attack, this degree of denigration and this hate. They cannot walk away comforted by the fact that they are members of the federal parliament and that these people are ratbags. In a very real sense, this legislation deals with a fundamental problem in the electorate. As people on both sides have acknowledged, whilst our society has generally been able to cater for a wide diversity of backgrounds, if we are honest about it, we would recognise that some groups in the wider society seek to undermine multiculturalism in the country and seek to engender racism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) noted that one or two of the actions seemingly directed against the Jewish community actually had a basis in accidents. There is evidence in one case in Melbourne that it might have been a bit more to do with a feud over money and jewellery than anything to do with religion, but very few people dispute that there is obvious evidence in Melbourne of a campaign directed against Jewish yeshivas and synagogues. In the aftermath of John Newman's death&mdash;whatever the reasons for and the background of that&mdash;there have been manifestations of racism against the Asian and Vietnamese communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not go along with the exaggerated reports of the Islamic Council of New South Wales of attacks on every second Muslim walking down the road. Many of those are loutish activities that have nothing to do with racism. However, in the aftermath of the Gulf War, there was a very real upswing in attacks on people of Arabic descent in this country. Equally, we might be comforted that, in relation to the Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian conflict, things have not got out of hand here but, once again, some people out there in the community have manifested racial hatred and have attacked others on grounds that this government should deal with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst it might be very reassuring to us that the Leader of the National Party would treat people making these remarks as ratbags, it is a bigger problem than that. Many of the people who suffer this degree of assault and are threatened see themselves as having very little power to do anything about it. They have no knowledge of any laws that can protect them, and they are in groups that are often inarticulate, disorganised and incapable of manifesting activity against racism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To some degree I agree with some of the remarks made by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). I think that people are not facing up to the truth if they do not acknowledge that many of the most extreme forms of racism in this country are manifested by people from other societies&mdash;not because they have different blood or are of a different colour but because they come from societies that have not had the historical growth that we have had, have not learned to accept other cultures and perhaps have not had the benefit of a number of institutions that this country has inherited. I do not for one moment dispute his conclusions that very real threats can come from a variety of ethnic groups in this country, perhaps even more than from the mainstream culture. That, however, is not a reason to undermine the legislation. It is not a reason to come in here and oppose the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that I am particularly pleased with in this legislation as opposed, from recollection, to that which went through in New South Wales is that there is no reference in this legislation to the predominant culture or to minorities, and to this law applying only to them. That is a very important point because there was a problem in New South Wales. A large part of the electorate perceived the legislation as being designed only to protect non-English speakers, as being dictated to some degree by ethnic lobbies. This legislation does not do that. It talks about activities directed against any person on a racial, ethnic ground. That is an important advance in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the same with regard to discrimination. People are being dishonest if they do not acknowledge that in parts of the work force in this country if you are not a particular nationality you cannot be employed in certain jobs, in certain sectors of the economy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation comes forward not because&mdash;as suggested by the Leader of the National Party&mdash;some social engineers sat around one afternoon over a few drinks and decided that it might not be a bad idea. It comes forward after a series of investigations into this problem. The honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) noted quite correctly that only the national inquiry into racist violence in 1992, which noted 60 incidents, specifically recommended criminal penalties. However, I do not think it is a matter of these inquiries dictating to the government or to the opposition their stand. I take my position on the basic analysis they make of our society. </PARA>

It has to be seen in the context of the actual problem out there. That problem has been indicated by the reality of violence, by the reality of groups who seek to denigrate others, by the reality of forces that exploit racism. It should also be seen in the context of statistical evidence by people such as Chris Cuneen and I. des Rome who in the article `Monitoring hate crimes' in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Current Issues in Criminal Justice, 5(2)</EMPHASIS>, November 1993, evidenced an increase in problems in this area.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to bash the heads of members of the opposition, but I think they have to review their attitude on this matter.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst we are talking about the international dimensions of this matter, I refer to the United Kingdom's third report of the Home Affairs Committee entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Racial attacks and harassment</EMPHASIS>. What did this Tory dominated committee conclude about the problem? I acknowledge that perhaps the United Kingdom is facing more intense difficulty in this matter. What did those people of all parties conclude about this field of policy? They recommended that there be additional and consecutive gaol terms of up to five years if there were a racial element to assaults. They spoke of racial harassment meriting a #1,000 fine and a sentence of 12 months. They asked that the United Kingdom re-emphasise to chief constables that tackling racial incidents should be a priority. At the same  time, they stated that the police force had to again look at ethnic recruitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to note some of the committee's remarks. It agreed with Sir Peter Imbert, the former Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . racial attacks are not only against the law, they are also socially divisive and morally repugnant.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would go further. We believe that if racism is allowed to grow unchecked it will begin to corrode the fabric of our open and tolerant society. For this reason, crimes and anti-social behaviour become more serious when they are racially-motivated than when they are not.</PARA>
<PARA>It is quite obvious that this is a core element of this legislation. The Conservative dominated committee further commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . an assault motivated by racism is more socially-divisive than any other assault, and if allowed to pass unchecked will begin to corrode the fabric of our tolerant society.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If evidence of racial motivation is presented it will be for the court to decide whether or not the evidence is sufficient to establish the crime. We see no problem with this. We certainly feel that if racially-motivated assaults are to be deterred it cannot be an acceptable argument that it may require a little more investigative work by the police.</PARA>
<PARA>I turn to Germany, where the onset of unemployment and the huge influx of refugee claimants have led to a far more intense debate and violence. I refer to a document from the Federal Ministry of the Interior. I note again that this is not a social democratic government. This document has emanated from a coalition government of the Christian Democrats and the Free Democrats. This document of the Ministry of the Interior dated July 1993 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government does not tolerate that brawlers and right-wing extremists take the current political discussion about the right of asylum as a pretext for xenophobic actions and brutal attacks. Putting people's life and limb at danger will not be put up with. The Federal Government has banned three right-wing extremist organizations and has thus given a resolute and unmistakable warning signal directed at those using right-wing agitation and violence. It is at present being examined whether other organizations can also be banned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the long run the violence directed at foreigners can only be stemmed if, beyond stepping up police protection and criminal prosecution measures, the young people can be convinced that attacks against foreigners are unfair, unworthy and harmful and that tolerance and cosmopolitanism are desirable aims. This attitude can be achieved by short- and medium-term educational campaigns and an unwavering school education.</PARA>
<PARA>The document goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The police law and the criminal law can also be employed to forestall anti-foreigner attacks. The Penal Code makes the following acts punishable offences: incitement to hatred and violence against segments of the population&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which is an element of this legislation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">incitement to racial hatred&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which is another area that this bill attempts to counteract&mdash;damage to property&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which is another matter that the legislation has in its sights&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and all acts directed against life and limb of others.</PARA>
<PARA>Whilst we might be comforted by the fact that racial hatred does not confront us most of the time, that we are in the predominant culture and that we do not suffer from it, in the wider electorate it is a very real problem and the government attempts in this legislation to address it. Mr John Dowd, the former Attorney-General of New South Wales, when he introduced legislation on the same policy area on 4 May 1989, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Victims of racial vilification require an accessible and inexpensive means of redress. Legislation against racial vilification must involve a balancing of the right to free speech and the right to a dignified and peaceful existence free from racist harassment and vilification.</PARA>
<PARA>In introducing that legislation, he put his name clearly on the line&mdash;he recognised the need to be pro-active and the need to face up to the problem. He further went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is a clear statement by the Government that racial vilification has no place in our community. That is no reflection on our society. Our society has been perhaps the most successful in bringing together people from different parts of the world to form a community in which my children's generation and, more importantly, my grandson's generation, will not draw a distinction between themselves and the ancestry of others. They will be known for who they themselves are. That is an important statement. We are better than the rest of the world but our standards must be higher. There is a growth of racial vilification within the community. The Government does not intend to interfere with freedom of speech but it must redress the balance . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, I want to indicate one area of concern with the legislation&mdash;and I might be taking a very literal wording of the material. I note that a definition in King-Ansell v. Police, 1979, in the New Zealand Law Reports, is used as the basis upon which certain abuse will be judged. That definition takes a very wide interpretation of ethnic groups. I think we are all aware&mdash;and this was certainly highlighted by the member for O'Connor&mdash;that some religious groups have been called what might be termed ethno-cultural. The ones that stand out in this country are the Sikhs and the Jews. Clause 18C of the Racial Hatred Bill says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">18C.(1) It is unlawful for a person to do an act, otherwise than in private, if:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the act is reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to offend, insult, humiliate . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Some of the interpretation material speaks of Muslims. There is a very reasonable concern about people making statements about Shariah law, about female circumcision and about a wide variety of religions. But I do not want to single out Muslims; let us just say that statements are made about a wide variety of religious groups. We are verging on semi-blasphemy laws here. The wide interpretation of that wording of this law&mdash;for all of the qualifications and for all of the reassurances that were given by the government&mdash;could be used basically to diminish debate, to diminish comment, and to diminish criticism of particular religious groups. I would feel that this is one of the weaknesses of the legislation. On the broad front, the legislation is merited, it is overdue, and it is worth while. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have come into this debate on the Racial Hatred Bill after approximately 5 1/2 hours, and I have to say that I have listened to it with great interest. I have an open mind on a whole range of matters, and I have come to the chamber willing to be persuaded on an alternative point of view to that which I previously formed&mdash;which was to oppose the bill. But after that whole 5 1/2 hours I still remain unconvinced that there has been any example provided which makes this bill so necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill has been around for a number of years, and the enormous ground swell of public opinion against the need for it has been evident. I have watched the polling and have sought many views, certainly from my own electorate&mdash;which I am here to represent. I continue to oppose this bill. It amazes me that the government is pushing for its enactment, despite the overwhelming public opinion against the need for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one is more opposed to racial prejudice and the expressions of hatred that can result than I am. But this big stick approach does not have my support. There are already legal sanctions and criminal sanctions within the community to deal with all of the examples that I have heard presented in this chamber yesterday and today during the debate. I have heard examples of racist graffiti on walls. Laws exist to bring the people who do that to account. Some of the examples of expressions of racial prejudice and hatred that have been presented sadden me, particularly when parents have been upset by expressions of that sentiment by children in the school grounds about their own children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appals me to witness the baseness of human nature which uses forms of vilification&mdash;be they religious, ethnic, of a political persuasion or even about disability. Some of the things that have been said in this chamber would fall into that category. As a matter of principle, I believe in the concept that all people are equal; all people ought to be treated equally regardless of their ethnic or religious origins. Australia is renowned for its sense of fairness and tolerance. The member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) has given us examples of vilification that have occurred in the United Kingdom and Germany. Other speakers have mentioned situations in Canada and other places. This is Australia, which has a reputation for tolerance and fair-mindedness. I rely on that sentiment and on taking a better approach to resolve the difficulties that we have been talking about and that we are equally concerned about than on taking a big stick approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will contribute towards the demise of progress towards tolerance. It will detract from any progress towards a sense of decency and acceptance of people from all races in Australia. The bill advances the concept that what is a criminal offence is that which has actually been a crime for the last 80 years, that is, the incitement or the perpetration of violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not agree with the view put forward by supporters of the bill that racial violence is qualitatively any worse than any other form of violence. Violence and destruction of property, whether actual or threatened, is deplorable. I again make the point that legal sanctions already exist against such acts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been interested in comments that this legislation will provide some form of moral imperative, by way of an educative role, to bring about a sense of tolerance. I particularly refer to the contribution made by the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown). This idea is really quite odd, coming from the government benches, following the debate on the sexual conduct bill in which the government of Tasmania was soundly condemned for using the educative function of legal sanctions and legislation in regard to its anti-sodomy law. Given that there can be far more compelling public interest questions associated with sodomy&mdash;like the expansion of the AIDS epidemic&mdash;it is amazing that the government now uses that argument to support its current case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the overriding urgency and need for this legislation has not been proved to me or to many other speakers. I have got some concerns about how this bill basically neuters what I consider to be the reasonable expectation which all Australians have come to treasure&mdash;the right to free speech. That right preserves the capacity for people to speak out on a whole range of issues which they consider to be in the public interest. Sometimes these views may require comment in regard to ethnic origins, whether in respect of immigration, foreign policy or any other matter. I see legislation such as this, in the hands of fringe minority groups, being used later to constrain such freedom. I continue with my intention to ensure that this legislation is not supported by the parliament and voted out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that this parliament makes law that has honourable intentions at the start but which, in the hands of fringe groups, is used for a purpose for which it was never intended. True freedom of speech allows the promotion of a range of views. Although the deliberate giving of offence may not be the purpose of such speech, it is sometimes amazing what people can be offended by. For example, I was offended this morning by assertions of the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) that the National Party is a group of redneck right-wing people. That is not fair or reasonable, and I resent the insinuation, so I am offended. We are so easily offended. When we get offended, we are likely to use whatever recourse is provided to us for compensation or recompense. If this bill becomes law, I am convinced that freedom of speech will be constrained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to turn to specific provisions of the bill to highlight a number of deficiencies that I have already observed. The bill amends the Crimes Act 1914 and the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. Firstly, in respect of the Crimes Act, three new crimes will be created. The first of these is the prohibition of threats to cause physical harm because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin. The second offence is the prohibition of threats to property because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin. The third offence is the prohibition of incitement of racial hatred because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first two laws have historically been the charter of the states to enact and administer, and I believe that that is where it should stay. The government has argued its case in respect of this legislation under section 51 of part V of the constitution. I have a copy of the constitution with me, and I exhort all honourable members to regularly read it. I think it contains some valuable sentiment to which we ought to continually refer. Section 51 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I refer in particular to placitum (xxvi), which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The people of any race for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws.</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the word `necessary' because I am not satisfied that there are persons within the community who can claim a lack of protection if this legislation is not put in place. Each state already has criminal laws protecting people against those elements in the community that would threaten to cause physical harm to persons or property irrespective of the purpose for issuing the threat&mdash;whether of a political nature or because of racial or even matrimonial discord. No deficiency is so blatantly obvious in this existing state legislation which can so justify the need for this Racial Hatred Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government seems to have a great propensity to ramrod the states and ride roughshod over their traditional areas of law. But, in this case, there is simply no justifiable cause or need. In fact, in browsing through the stipulated penalties in this new bill, I find that the retribution in respect of such offences seems to be much less than it is in existing state legislation. For example, in relation to threats to cause physical harm, the bill proposes imprisonment and a sentence of two years. In relation to threats to property, it proposes a sentence of one year and, in relation to incitement of racial hatred, it proposes a one-year penalty. That is substantially less than some penalties for like offences that already exist in state legislation which can extend to periods of five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the third crime that I oppose because I have formed the view that every fair-minded Australian also opposes it. I think it foments even more division than the bill purports to address. The purpose of this third crime is to establish&mdash;I think it is a ridiculous situation&mdash;that what people say and what people think ought to be considered as a crime. Regardless of how I feel or how anybody else might feel about expressions of vile and ignorant racial prejudice, this proposal to control what people say and think is outrageous. How on earth can this parliament justify the enactment of legislation to control what people say and think? It is fair enough to control what people do when it impacts on the rights of others, but not what they say. People can say a whole lot of things but not necessarily act on what they say. They can say things out of anger, temper or frustration&mdash;and that, I have observed, often happens in this chamber. But does the parliament seriously want to make such people criminals?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the vast majority of fair-minded Australians want no part of racial vilification&mdash;and I am certainly one of those. But enacting this legislation, which we all know will be used by fringe minority groups for the wrong purposes, will achieve little towards what we ought to regard as an ultimate and noble aim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hatred, whatever its source or whatever its target, is a negative and a corrupting emotion. But that is all it is&mdash;an emotion or thought process. Other crimes deal with actions. These can be incitements to commit fraud, murder or sedition or threats of physical harm. All these crimes require some sense of physical action. Hatred is simply an expression of the mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are alternatives to the big stick approach of the Racial Hatred Bill to achieve the purposes that this legislation sets out. We ought to look at our children. If my children came home and were the source of racial prejudice in examples that have been given in this chamber, I would take some necessary educative action to restore their sense of fairness. Children have an enormous capacity to change the attitudes of society. I remember eight or nine years ago when the concept of recycling was part of a public education program. It was my children who came home and demanded of me a second bin for the recycling of materials. They actually asked, `Why haven't we got two rubbish bins&mdash;one for the rubbish and one for recycling material?' The children were able to make a parent more responsible in what was considered to be a vital issue in those days&mdash;the community recycling of waste materials. We lose a valuable opportunity by adopting the big stick approach rather than an incentive process when dealing with the essential issue of removing racial intolerance and prejudice from our community and the society we are all part of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A trap has been opened up here if we want to fall for the concept that the thought police seem to want to foster in our society. The enactment of a new crime covering what people say will be a serious erosion of the expression of free speech&mdash;and it is in the creative environment of free speech that community debate is stimulated on a whole range of national issues. My view&mdash;and I stand by this view&mdash;is that this legislation will erode this great principle. As I have said, I think there are far better ways to achieve those objectives which were flagged by the minister in his second reading speech. I note that the explanatory memorandum states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill is based on the principle that no person in Australia need live in fear because of his or her race, colour, or national or ethnic origin.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are sentiments the general thrust of which have my wholehearted support, and no-one would be more anxious about them than I. But the constant message I hear, particularly from my electorate, which contains a whole fruit salad of ethnic groups&mdash;Turks, Greeks, Italians, Indians, Pakistanis, Asians of all persuasions&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mind boggles in respect of the second major platform of this bill, which is the amendment to the Racial Discrimination Act. An amendment has been proposed which will allow a complainant to bring an action before the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission about expressions made by others. It is proposed that, if another person acts in a way which causes offence, insult, humiliation or intimidation because of race, colour, or national or ethnic origin, a case can be brought before the commission.

My mind boggles when I try to imagine what will happen to journalists, cartoonists and comedians&mdash;for example, the journalist who wants to lambast the poms the next time they thrash us in a Test Match.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation involves a fundamental issue of social justice. Why do I say that? Because we are talking here about the protection of the fundamental human rights of all Australians and, in particular, those groups of Australians which, unfortunately, the evidence tells us have been subjected to racist attacks, racist taunts and racist violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have made it perfectly clear, especially in the last 11 years since we have been in government, that we support multiculturalism, social justice principles, fundamental human rights and, as a part of that, access and equity. What do I mean by access and equity? I have special responsibility in the government for the access and equity program. This program is designed to ensure that all Australians, irrespective of their race or ethnic, cultural, language or even religious background, have a fair go, have equality not only in formal terms before the law but also in terms of the programs of the national government and the state governments that have also agreed to the access and equity program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about a wide range of programs here&mdash;employment, education, training, health, aged care, language services, the law and the Attorney-General's Department. In all of those programs and many others, the fundamental question is: do we have equality of access? Have we achieved what we as a society set out to achieve&mdash;that is, to ensure that everyone is treated equally irrespective of their racial, cultural and ethnic background?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year I have conducted 18 multicultural consultations throughout Australia on behalf of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Multicultural Affairs, Senator Bolkus. In those consultations we had a very wide range of people from the ethnic communities and people working with the communities. It became clear that there are still shortfalls. Some have to do with shortfalls on the part of government. I am going to address that issue in a report that is to be tabled in parliament in the next three weeks, but we will need further programs to address those shortfalls. I will be looking at further programs next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important point is that there is an additional element&mdash;discrimination on the basis of ethnicity and race. There is no doubt, unfortunately, that this discrimination continues. It is not widespread in the sense that it is everywhere, but it is significant. For example, in the area of employment, some employers, because people speak good English but with an accent, will refuse to employ them. They do not even give them an interview. They do not even see them. When they do have a perfect English accent and get to an interview and the employer sees that they are of a different race or ethnicity to the mainstream, what do the employers do? They do not give them a fair go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying that is true of all employers but there is a significant group. This issue has to be tackled. You might say, `Surely education is the way to tackle this issue.' Indeed, education is a primary element but, unfortunately, there is incontrovertible evidence in the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Racist Violence</EMPHASIS> and in other reports before the government that the attitudes of some individuals and groups will not be fixed by simple education. Their attitudes are based on hostility, negativism and dogmatism, and they will not be changed simply by education. Those people who refuse to participate or to discuss the issues but actually go out and spread hatred of others because of ethnicity or race are the ones this bill is deliberately concerned with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I outline two situations that exist here. We have first the extremely bigoted individual who not only has negative attitudes towards other people because of their race and/or ethnic background but also expresses these views to others in the form of clear and blunt statements of hatred and who incites others to undermine the rights of those people, and even in some cases to physically harm them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Racist Violence</EMPHASIS> documented many cases. It might be worth referring to a couple of them. The report states:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Lebanese family in Sydney was subjected to a `terror campaign' for almost two months. They felt isolated in an area which had a reputation for hostility to and racist violence against Muslims. After an increasing number of incidents, including attempts to set the house on fire and windows being broken by stones, the husband and father of the family suffered a stroke and heart-attack, and died. His physician attributed his death to the campaign. The family reported that repeated complaints to the police had not resulted in them obtaining any protection or in anyone being charged and, indeed, that the police had threatened family members with arrest because they did not believe their claims that the house had been attacked.</PARA>
<PARA>Evidence to the inquiry from Jewish organisations indicates that attacks on Jewish community and religious centres, schools and businesses have occurred on an almost monthly basis over the past two years. This included the fire bombing of a Jewish girls school in Sydney and damage to a range of business premises operated by or for Jewish people. Since that report, there have been many other incidents of attacks and hatred campaigns against the Jewish community. It is a nonsense to pretend that the phenomenon does not exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the bigoted individuals, there are those more terrifying groups&mdash;the racist groups. The concern of these nasty and spiteful organisations is to directly threaten people because of their racial or ethnic background. These organisations often operate in a secretive fashion and often resort to violence or threats of violence. Irene Moss also talks about these in the report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Nationalist Movement (ANM), centred in Perth, has been involved in a range of activities including fire bombing Chinese restaurants in Perth and conducting a concerted publicity campaign which had a significant effect on racial attitudes in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Those who think that such campaigns do not have impact should note that point. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">National Action (NA), centred in Sydney, has also been particularly concerned with the level of Asian migration to Australia, and has produced similar (although generally more sophisticated) stickers, posters and leaflets as ANM. NA has paid particular attention to action against groups opposed to racism.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the years that I was chairman of the parliamentary and caucus immigration committees, which was a number of years, I received a number of letters which threatened to kill not only me but also members of my family and which insisted that I was not Australian because of my ethnic background and because of my views promoting multiculturalism, immigration, and racial and ethnic equality. Suffice it to say&mdash;and I do not want to go into details&mdash;that those who believe that these groups do not exist, or that this form of intimidation does not exist, quite frankly do not know what they are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very few members of this House actually want to argue against the view that we should confront such individuals and such groups. Of course, there is another positive reason why we should do so: we in Australia are building one of the great multicultural societies of the world. We are building a multicultural society based on a framework of social justice, equality of opportunity, tolerance and appreciation of cultural diversity. Most Australians enthusiastically endorse that concept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This multicultural society has been so successful that it is seen as a model by many other countries. Australia is continually receiving praise for its approach to multiculturalism. Recently, when I was in Cairo at the International Conference on Population and Development, a number of representatives of different nations specifically spoke to me about our policy of multiculturalism and the positive impact which it has had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given all of that, it is true to say that we have that base of multiculturalism, of social justice and of tolerance, but we also have a significant minority of individuals and groups who are determined to tear that fabric apart. These people are not going to be thwarted simply by some sophisticated argument. They know what they are on about. They know what they do not want: a tolerant multicultural Australian society. They are out to tear it apart through their activities. So they embark on all kinds of campaigns of promoting racial hatred and ethnic vilification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From what we have heard, it is true that many members of the opposition&mdash;I do not know whether it is the majority or not&mdash;support the idea of racial vilification or racial hatred legislation, including apparently the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer). So we ask: why is the bill being opposed? This is a very difficult question to answer, especially since we are told that the opposition is going to produce an alternative bill based on New South Wales legislation. Yet the government of New South Wales, through its own Minister for Multicultural and Ethnic Affairs, supports our legislation. Anybody looking at this would want to ask: what are the bona fides in this?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our legislation is being supported by Michael Photios, who is the Minister for Multicultural and Ethnic Affairs in the government of New South Wales. We are told that the opposition is going to draft something based on the New South Wales legislation, as if this bill does not have any similarities with the New South Wales legislation. Of course it does. Yet we can clearly see that those people in the Liberal Party who know what they are talking about in terms of the ethnic communities, who know what they are talking about in terms of these issues, support the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation where the Leader of the Opposition is caught between those people in his party who do not want any legislation&mdash;and we have heard that from many of them here and it amounts to nearly the totality of the National Party&mdash;and those people who are prepared to look at some form of legislation. What did he do? He came up with the ludicrous claim that he is going to present his own racial hatred bill as if that will be some alternative solution to the problem. That is nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If opposition members had been content to honestly accept the fact that they are opposing the bill for no other reason than political opportunism and that they cannot bring the tensions within their own ranks together, at least some of us who feel very strongly about this bill would understand their position. But we have had the spectacle of members of the opposition in this House pretending to present valid arguments about the impact of the bill. If we looked at most of the arguments logically, we would find that we would not have any other bill. Most of the arguments have been against any form of racial vilification or racial hatred bill. So what is the opposition talking about bringing in an alternative bill for?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leaving that point aside, one argument has been put forward which is very misleading and is intended to try to create fear in the community. The absurd argument that I am referring to is when those opposite pretend that they are concerned about the impact of the bill on the ethnic communities of Australia. Let me make it perfectly clear: there is no doubt that these communities and their leaders overwhelmingly support the bill. Meetings of ethnic community leaders have applauded the bill. The New South Wales Ethnic Communities Council not only supported the bill but also condemned the opposition for opposing the bill. It also applauded Mr Photios's support for the bill. So how can the opposition claim that the ethnic communities do not support the bill?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than direct our attention in their comments to racism, opposition members have been concentrating on claims that the bill will have an impact on the differing views held in different ethnic communities. In other words, the very communities that are most concerned to have the bill to protect their rights were told that they do not want the bill because there will be problems for them when the bill comes in because they will not be able to have debates or discussions between themselves. No evidence has been produced to support this claim, yet it has been made by a number of speakers, including the Leader of the National Party, the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) and the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each of them in one way or another has tried to tell us that the bill is going to have a negative impact on multiculturalism because the ethnic communities will not be able to discuss differences of opinion on political issues and other issues. This is a nonsense. This nonsense has to be exposed. This claim has nothing to do with free speech. The fact of the matter is that, if we really support free speech, we must support the idea of the protection of the general framework of free speech. That means ensuring that there are limits to utterances when they promote racial hatred and undermine our multicultural society. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The blacks were accepted by the white society as inferior human beings of inferior intellect who were dirty, smelly and lived in shanty towns of their own which were tolerated but not accepted by the white community.

In both instances, when we sat down together to eat our lunch from a brown paper bag, we discussed race relations&mdash;the things that divided us and the things that we had in common.

Without canvassing the details, I can tell you that I have been and that it hurts. There are those of my colleagues who come from other countries and backgrounds who have described to me the incredible racial ostracism to which they were subjected as children and young adults in Australia.

Invariably, I say to new Australians at citizenship ceremonies that Australia has become the greatest example on earth of a melting pot of the world's humanity without the racial and religious intolerance and hatred leading to violence and physical acts of desecration which are so prevalent in many other and older societies in both the developed and developing world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I came in 1990 to join this House as a democratically elected representative of the people, I did so with some trepidation for fear that I might be rejected in this place because of my accent, and that people might question my commitment to this country versus the country of my birth. I need not have worried. I recall that on 8 May 1990, as we left this place, having been duly sworn in as members of the House of Representatives of Australia, the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) walked up to me, stuck out his hand and said, `Well, Yank, I bet you thought you'd never make it.' I responded, `Well, Ian, it wasn't exactly something I grew up as a child wanting to do.' The point of this is that, under the bill we are debating today, there might be those who would take the remarks of the honourable member for Barker as offensive. I took them as a term of endearment and friendship, and I still do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has only ever been one person in this place who had the audacity to question my commitment to Australia because of my place of birth, and that was the former member for Capricornia who, in debate on a notice of motion raised by me condemning the Prime Minster for denigrating the Queen and the flag, stated that I was un-Australian and I should go back to Yankeeland. I was deeply offended, but I sought my recourse through the procedures of this place or would have sought it privately. I would never seek recourse for such statements via the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission or through the courts. I note that the former member now resides at Her Majesty's pleasure in a Queensland gaol for other criminal offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I made the point previously that, in my view, no other nation has managed mass immigration as well as Australia. That is not to imply that we are perfect, that we do not have problems or that there is not racism or intolerance in Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It seems to me that the difference between the United States and Australia is that Americans have generally insisted on integration into the American society by its migrants and have not viewed with tolerance outward manifestations of race or national origin. In recent decades, we in this country have done it differently. We have allowed immigrants from other cultures to express their heritage and their conventions while quietly encouraging them and helping them to learn English and to become a part of the general Australian society. As a result, I see no evidence that we are breaking up into separate tribes, which seems to be occurring in the United States. We have managed better integration of other cultures into Australia than we have our relations with our own Aboriginals. We need to do very much better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I reject this bill because it is a serious intrusion into the very basic foundation stone of our democracy, which is freedom of speech. Every time we write another black-letter law to restrict freedom of speech, we chip away at that foundation stone and we undermine the very basis of the free and democratic society which has drawn to our shores so many people from countries of oppression. This bill is not an issue of rights or responsibilities; it is an issue of the basis of democracy founded on freedom of speech. A few selected quotations might help us to understand the nature of that very basic freedom. Firstly, Woodrow Wilson said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have always been amongst those who believe that the greatest freedom was the greatest safety, because if a man is a fool the best thing to do is to encourage him to advertise the fact by speaking.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Opinions only become dangerous to a State only when persecution makes it necessary for the people to communicate their ideas under the bond of secrecy.</PARA>

<PARA>Lewis D. Brandeis, in a concurring opinion in Whitney v. California 1927, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fear of serious injury cannot alone justify suppression of free speech and assembly. Men feared witches and burned them. It is the function of speech to free men from the bondage of irrational fears. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They have said it all and much better than ever I could.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are four essential parts to this bill. Clauses 58 and 59 of part IVA make it a criminal offence to threaten to cause physical harm or to threaten to destroy or damage property because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of any other person or group of persons. It should be an offence to threaten to damage persons or property and any fair society would deem it so. But I am advised that it is already an offence to threaten to cause injury to people or their property in each of the Australian states and the territories. The question in my mind is why we need such federal legislation when the states already have such statutes in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have listened to the speeches of some of the government members in this debate and they have spoken with justifiable alarm at property damage imposed on some religious institutions. We already have in place laws to deal with such offences. It remains only to catch the perpetrators and subject them to trial and justice. Clause 60 of part IVA would make it a criminal offence for the intention of inciting racial hatred if the action of a person is reasonably likely to incite racial hatred and is done because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the other person or some or all of the people in the group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot find in the legislation any requirement that actual incitement of racial hatred need take place. It would surely be unconscionable that we would consider imprisoning individuals for their intentions which have not been proved to have resulted in actual harm. The Attorney has not defined the term `hatred' but instead will leave it up to each actual case in court for our jurists to determine exactly what constitutes hatred. It is a subjective term, not easily codified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth section of the bill is found in clause 18C of part IIA, which makes it a civil offence to do an act which is reasonably likely to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another person or a group of people because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the other person or some or all of the people in that group. Such a statute would absolutely offend any concept of freedom of speech. Thus during question time I asked the Attorney-General a question involving the use of words such as `bloody yank' and `septic tank'. If those words were used against me I would find them extremely offensive, insulting and humiliating. I would likewise find it offensive, insulting and humiliating if someone called me a `fat poofter' or a `green toad' or any one of a multiplicity of derogatory nouns and adjectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we legislate for every unkind thing that one person says to another, whether or not in public, our courts and our tribunals will be full to overflowing and division in the community will reach such proportions as to put at risk the very basic tolerant fabric of our Australian society.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a letter to me and I assume other members and senators, Richard Black of R.D. Black and Associates, Solicitors, of Cronulla, New South Wales made the following point which bears consideration and putting on the record:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the enduring charms of Australians is that they do not give undue reverence to any person or to any institution, including political correctness. This very characteristic could involve a non reverent but also non racist Australian in a brush with a bureaucrat empowered by this proposed legislation for expressing criticism of immigration policy, including immigration levels and/or certain aspects of multi culturalism.</PARA>
<PARA>In speaking to his justification for this bill, the Attorney-General has stated that there is an educative  function associated with black-letter law. He has also stated that this proposed law is unlikely to be used, as the New South Wales legislation in this area has not been used. There is, however, a basic incompatibility between his position on the sexual privacy bill that federal legislation is needed, notwithstanding that the state laws which he wants to override are not used, and his position on this bill that the law will be educative but is unlikely to be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General has stated that he has consulted widely. Not only did he fail to consult the federal opposition but also he even withheld details of the bill until just prior to tabling. If he is so concerned that this legislation is urgent and necessary, I find it incredible that he did not even consider consulting this side of the House on the detail or even let us know what the bill would say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation represents an attempt by the Attorney-General to regulate social behaviour through legislation. We all should know that such an approach is doomed to failure. This bill is not about rights of individuals; it is more about basic civil liberties. When it comes to civil liberties, this Labor government has not got clean hands. I draw to the attention of the House the government's prior attempt to introduce into Australia an identity card for every individual in Australia. The people of Australia quite rightly rejected that basic attack on their individual liberties and right to privacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last parliament, the government rammed through the House and the Senate its political advertising bill, supported by the Australian Democrats, which was an attack on freedom of speech and freedom of press. Quite rightly, the High Court judged the government's attempt on that occasion to be unconstitutional. In the last parliament, I brought to the House a private member's bill to eliminate from the Industrial Relations Act a section which made it a criminal offence to criticise a commissioner of the Industrial Relations Commission or the commission itself. The government refused to process my bill through the parliament. But the High Court found that the government was wrong, that I was right and that clause 299(1)(d)(ii) of the Industrial Relations Act violated freedom of press and freedom of speech. The government has not got clean hands when it comes to basic civil liberties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to make it clear that I will not be an apologist or spokesman for the ultra right-wing race hate groups which  might otherwise use my speech on freedom of speech. Racial hatred and vilification are to be deplored, but anti-racial hatred cannot be legislated against; we can only educate. Every restraint we put on freedom of speech lessens our ability to grow in positive ways as individuals, as communities, and as a nation. </PARA>

We have various ways of combating racism in this country. We can do so through the laws enacted by this parliament that the Attorney-General has put before us today which set out the basic parameters of conduct for citizens who wish to live in this society. We can certainly do so through education campaigns. Such campaigns have been instituted in our schools and throughout our local communities to keep to the forefront of people's attention the need to put behind them, for the sake of the cohesion of the nation, some of the instincts that often surface in ethnic communities and various groups in the community. We also have a range of community initiatives and programs that are resourced by local, state and federal governments. They are designed to bring people from various communities together to share their ethnic experiences, to encourage the expression of their origins, and to encourage them to be more tolerant of the cultures and customs of the wide diversity of people who make up Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several central questions in this debate which I will canvas briefly. We need to ask ourselves whether the substance of this legislation is worthy of support from the national parliament of Australia. This bill is entitled the Racial Hatred Bill 1994. I do not think anybody in this community thinks that the issue addressed by this bill is not a substantial one and is not worthy of the strongest support of the parliament of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have debated here the necessity of this particular legislation. I alluded before to the fact that we ought not delude ourselves that we have a society which is free from the sorts of racial tensions and problems that abound in other societies throughout the world. It is to Australia's enduring credit that we have been able to put the community overlay on some of the tensions that perhaps have been brought to this country by ethnic communities. Despite the fact that we have a cohesive community here in Australia, there is a need for the Commonwealth parliament to state very clearly, through legislation of this type, the sorts of conduct it expects from each and every citizen when confronted with the issue of racial diversity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very interested to take up the issue of whether this bill will actually impede freedom of speech and expression, because that seems to be one of the fundamental arguments being raised in criticism of what the government is doing today. As far as the freedom of speech argument is concerned, we have to appreciate that society and its operations on a day-to-day basis is just a day-to-day story of the compromise of the rights of citizens, the rights of assembly, the rights of expression, the rights of free speech and the rights of governments when they enact regulations and securities to protect the security of the nation, for example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to honourable members opposite that, whilst they speak of freedom of speech here today, they ought to reflect on those people in our society who have a right to be free from harassment, who have a right to live in peace and harmony. This legislation quite clearly says to those people who may well compromise those rights to freedom from harassment and the freedom to live in peace and harmony that this society will impose severe penalties on conduct which is racially motivated. If we put ourselves in the position of various racial groups in this diverse society that we have in Australia today, we find that many of those people already engage in defensive behaviour because of their ethnicity. Where those people are subject to racial harassment, they may well engage in further reclusive behaviour which could mean that they fail to reach their potential in society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Society places restrictions on freedom of speech, and those particular restrictions have been canvassed in debate today. Governments impose certain restrictions on freedom of speech in the interests of national security. I think this particular legislation, although it does not in the main restrict freedom of speech, may impose some brakes on the behaviour of some people in our society on the basis of preserving national unity. This bill strengthens our vigilance in a very sensitive area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Let us call a spade a spade in this debate. The position of opposition members is being clearly articulated from a proposition that they are seeking to preserve the internal political cohesion of the coalition. It is not really motivated by the fact that they have a concern about freedom of speech because they know in their heart of hearts that this bill does not compromise it. Their opposition today has more to do with the politics of the coalition and the leadership issues of the coalition than with a clinical analysis of this bill and the manner in which it might or might not inhibit freedom of speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In the decade that I have been in public life, I have had a lot to do with groups that push racial hatred and racial disharmony. I have had a lot to do with the way in which they do that in the most deceitful and surreptitious of ways. I would have thought the members of the National Party of Australia would have been more sensitive to this piece of legislation than they are demonstrating in this House in this debate. In the past, the National Party has been the subject of deliberate undermining in its regional branches and its regional branch structures by organisations such as the Australian League of Rights. I say to members of the National Party that I am disappointed in the manner in which you have opposed this legislation because it is based on three reports that have a high degree of credibility in the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is the product of widespread consultation with the Australian community, not over a period of months but over a period of years.

Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition that this is the time for some real leadership. It is not a time to be threatening colleagues who open their mouths in a coalition caucus with ejection from the shadow ministry. It is a time for the Leader of the Opposition to stand up in this parliament and do what his previous leader indicated he would do and support a rational and reasonable piece of legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This legislation is important. It is legislation which goes to the very heart of the rights of citizenship in this country. It is legislation which affects every single person here whether that person arrived on a plane yesterday, is fourth or fifth generation Australian or is an Aboriginal Australian who can trace ancestry back indefinitely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As probably one of the rare people in this chamber, I lived for most of my youth in other peoples's countries, and I am very conscious of what racial discrimination is all about. I was discriminated against on numerous occasions. I saw other people discriminate against each other on the basis of race, on the basis of tribe, on the basis of colour and on the basis of religion. I saw people kill each other for some or all of those reasons. So the whole issue of incitement to commit a crime or to affect the rights of a fellow citizen for no other reason than an act of birth or a physiological reality is something that I take very seriously indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation in many respects fails to achieve its own goals. Already speakers on this side have made the point that it smacks of a political exercise, and I think that is a fair description. If the government were genuine about trying to achieve its objectives, it would not have to use a steamroller to crack a nut irrespective of how hard that nut might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Speakers on the government side have told us, in their sonorous tones, how the underpinnings of the Racial Hatred Bill are the various reports of the Australian Law Reform Commission. They have all been quoted here. But they have been selectively quoted. That is the important point. I want to go through them in detail to emphasise how none of those reports has asked the government of the day to take criminal action or to make criminal matters which they regard more appropriate to be left in the hands of the civil jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Law Reform Commission in its report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Multiculturalism and the Law</EMPHASIS> concluded that incitement to racist hatred and hostility should be made a civil offence dealt with by conciliation. The commission specifically rejected making it a criminal offence, noting that it would be unduly restrictive to freedom of speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is precisely the major objection of the opposition parties to this legislation. Commissioner Elliott Johnston QC, in his report to the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, also recommended a civil offence of the kind existing in New South Wales. He supported conciliation as a means of dealing with racial vilification, but he rejected the use of criminal sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report of the National Inquiry into Racist Violence in Australia</EMPHASIS>, also recommended creation of a civil offence of incitement to racial hostility. In all of those cases the commission rejected the view that incitement to racial hostility should be a criminal offence, and in that report on racist violence it concluded with these words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Incitement of racial hostility is not as serious as outright racist violence and intimidation. It need not, therefore, be subject to criminal laws and criminal penalties. It should be dealt with as a civil matter under the Racial Discrimination Act, with the same remedies, that is, conciliation and compensation, as provided for racial discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA>It is important to note that it is already an offence to threaten to cause injury to people&mdash;irrespective of their colour, their religion, their race or their property&mdash;in the Australian states and territories, although in some jurisdictions the laws are limited to specific types of threats. In many cases the penalties are higher than those provided for in this Racial Hatred Bill and accordingly, if a person were to threaten to destroy or to damage the property of another in New South Wales, that state's law, its Crimes Act, under section 199 provides that he or she would be liable to imprisonment for five years. If, however, the threat were motivated by racial hatred and prosecution were commenced under this proposed amendment to the Commonwealth Crimes Act, the person would be liable to imprisonment for only one year. Surely this discrepancy between the penalty in the Commonwealth legislation and that in the state legislation runs a risk of giving the impression that racially motivated crimes are treated less seriously than crimes motivated for other reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, therefore, our concerns about this legislation can be put down to the fact that the government's claim that it is acting on the advice of successive reports by royal commissions is false. The whole issue really turns on whether these requirements should be covered by the criminal and civil provisions and to what extent. In other words, what is the fair level of legal involvement where involvement could well result in a diminution in the rights of the citizen to freedom of speech, and freedom of assembly&mdash;which obviously flows from it&mdash;which are put at risk if the government brings down legislation of such a character that it interferes with those fundamental rights?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like it to be said that no Australian supports racist words or actions that involve threats to injure or to damage people or their property. Unfortunately, we all know that there are Australians, just as there are people of every nationality, who throughout history, from time immemorial, have sought to distinguish themselves from others and to take action that they regarded as appropriate but which we would regard as grossly inappropriate. The events of Rwanda in recent months are an outstanding and poignant example of the extremes and the excess to which people, neighbours, villages and communities can go once they get a lust to emphasise the differences between one group and another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I grew up in communities like that and I saw it happen. There is nothing more frightening than to see people dying because of their race, to see their houses blown up, destroyed and burnt, and their possessions with them, for no other reason than race. Fortunately, through most of our history&mdash;and, of course, many Aboriginal Australians would exclude themselves from this comment&mdash;Australia has been, relatively speaking, a nation that has been at peace with itself. There is no doubt that no member of the opposition parties would suggest that any citizen should have to live in fear of such threats or to tolerate people who incite others to make such threats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation falls into two parts. There are the criminal provisions which allow people to be sent to gaol, and there are the civil provisions which allow a person who objects to a racist remark to take the person who made those comments to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The question is: to what extent has this legislation gone? To what extent has the government fallen into the trap of trying to use this legislation in the guise of changing what it perceives to be a social wrong into a political advantage?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition believes that this legislation goes further than is necessary or appropriate to combat racial harassment. It goes further than is necessary to send a message to the wider community that such conduct is unacceptable. For that reason, we have committed ourselves to preparing legislation which will solve some of these problems and which will, at the same time, not contain the obvious difficulties which we have found in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are going further than that. The government, with all its talk, has not, as far as I am aware, seriously put forward the proposition that budget appropriation should be made available for a community education campaign to make people more aware of the need for racial tolerance. The opposition has committed $10 million over two years for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 60 of this bill is the essence of the criminal provisions. It states that a person must not, with the intention of inciting racial hatred against another person or a group of people, do an act, otherwise than in private, if the act is reasonably likely to incite hatred and is done because of the race, colour or nationality or ethnic origin of the other person. The penalty is one year in gaol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that clause 60, as it is currently drafted in this bill, is a fundamental denial of the rights of freedom of speech. It establishes a new class of offence which impacts upon expressions of opinion rather than expressions of violent intent&mdash;which, of course, we would not support. Such an incursion is objectionable and unwarranted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will not support a criminal sanction for expressing a view and encouraging others to adopt it when it does not incite people to damage property or persons. To create an offence of inciting racial hatred, but to fail to be able to link the incitement to damage to a person or a person's property, makes it an offence to try to get other people to agree with your own view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However wrong my view may be, in a free society which claims to believe in freedom of speech, I am entitled to argue with my colleague the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) that the world is flat. He will not believe it, but I still have the right to demand that he believe it. I can even shout at him to try to make him believe it, but he will still say to me, `The world is not flat.'</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QF4">Mr CONNOLLY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Touche! This issue is a fundamental one. This bill is a serious and inappropriate infringement of freedom of speech. We do not believe that a person should be put in gaol for encouraging others to adopt a view, however vile and racially prejudiced that view may be. We do not support laws that restrict what other people say, even when the vast majority of people believe that the remarks themselves are offensive or that they undermine our democratic system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth remembering that Australia is essentially a nation of migrants. Australians come from hundreds of destinations. We come from a myriad of cultures, creeds, races and communities. We came here together to build a new land, a land based on freedom, a land based on the rights of the individual to say what he likes, provided&mdash;to paraphrase Lord Hailsham&mdash;`My freedoms end where yours begin'. That is the essential ingredient and we must never lose sight of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 60, as it is proposed in this legislation, goes much further than any similar criminal offence in any state jurisdiction in Australia. In New South Wales, for example, which has a similar piece of legislation which has been quoted by many speakers in this debate, only threats or incitement to violence towards people or damage to property are criminal. That difference is crucial. The criminal sanction is justified when incitement is associated with threats to violence or damage to property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are serious doubts as to whether criminal sanctions are appropriate for expressing an opinion. The three reports I have referred to have covered that to some degree, and the case on that point stands without any difficulty. We have people such as Father Frank Brennan saying that racial vilification laws would only encourage the thought police and stifle public debate. Other people such as Phillip Adams take similar views, making the point that it is better to have bigots in the open than to have them hidden behind the doors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are men&mdash;and there are women in our community as well&mdash;who have been forthright over the years in defending the right to freedom of speech. Father Frank Brennan would be one of the most outstanding Australians in his unremitting support for Aboriginal welfare. All he has ever done is try to establish in the minds of the Australian community that Aboriginals are Australians entitled to a fair go and to the same range of rights, privileges and responsibilities as any other Australian citizen. The fact that he says this legislation contains within it the seeds of its own destruction and the potential to create an environment which makes it more difficult for him to be able to stand for the principles that he believes are important and more difficult for him to work for Aboriginal advancement is something this government should take very seriously indeed, in light of the views it has espoused over recent months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the New South Wales legislation. I made the point that no other jurisdiction in Australia has civil standards comparable to those in this bill. The New South Wales act, for example, limits civil action for incitement to racial hatred to acts that `incite hatred towards, serious contempt for, or severe ridicule of a person or group of persons on the grounds of the race of the persons'. That sets a much more appropriate standard than the looseness contained in this bill, where we find words such as `offend', `insult', `humiliate' and `intimidate'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that they are all words closely associated with value judgments. What the honourable member for O'Connor finds an insult I would probably find absolutely appalling. What he finds offensive I may not find offensive. What someone else may find humiliating I may not find humiliating. If somebody tries to intimidate me, I may think it is a joke. The point I am making is that how we react to these individual words and the expressions which are used to reach those conclusions varies indisputably from person to person and, of course, is often influenced by the environment in which the person grew up and by experiences he or she  previously had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So to create an offence of inciting racial hatred at large makes it an offence to try to get other people to agree with your own view. An offence is committed even if there is no urging of the other people to act on that view. Surely, that is a serious infringement of the rights of freedom of speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are related constitutional questions regarding decisions recently emanating from the High Court that we believe would strengthen the view that if these cases found their way to the High Court there is every possibility that the court would find them lacking in legal basis and the view that the laws prohibiting such discussion would be unconstitutional unless the government can show a counterbalancing public interest&mdash;or, more precisely, a public good. No doubt the government will claim that the public interest is freedom from racial harassment, but there is a good chance that the High Court would say in response that the law is too heavy-handed and that there are other measures such as education to combat racial harassment that would not impact on freedom of speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To sum up, while there is much to be said for a situation where civil remedies should be sought, there is a genuine problem which we have with this legislation in relation to its criminal provisions. There are three provisions in particular in the criminal context: proposed sections 58, 59 and 60. It is proposed section 60 which we find offensive, and it is principally on those grounds that we cannot support this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this most timely issue. The issue has been widely canvassed and, I am sorry to say, a lot of misunderstanding has grown up over this matter. I hope to be able to help minimise this misunderstanding and to maximise the self-evident virtues of the Racial Hatred Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every member of this House is aware that Australia is not racially, religiously or culturally homogenous. Many countries in the world are, including Iceland, Norway, Japan, Nepal, the Pacific island states and Bolivia. However, Australia is not, and this is recognised by our policy of multiculturalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Multiculturalism has a lot of enemies in Australia. Many people think that multiculturalism is, or will lead to, multinationalism. I think that these people are wrong. Objectively, this fear of multinationalism has no basis in any perceivable development in Australia today. The fact on the ground today is that various religious, racial and cultural groups live together with minimal strife. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying that there is no strife. Australia is not some kind of Garden of Eden. But there are certainly no group antagonisms, and there is no group violence, of the kind one sees every day in Europe, the Balkans and the USA. The reasons for this major level of calm and normality are not easily known. I suppose our national character is the principal reason that we are able to calmly cope with and absorb all who come to Australia. There is, in fact, great social pressure in Australia not to cause a fuss. One does not have to conform to the external way of dress or lifestyle, but there is serious pressure to conform in the matters of tolerance and not interfering in another person's life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This conformism is good and beneficial. We are a nation drawn from every part of the world, and our social order requires that tolerance and non-interference be our most important public social values. Because the causes of violence are so widespread in our country, we must make a serious, ongoing effort to avoid igniting these causes. This bill will strengthen this required serious and ongoing effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opponents of this bill are of the view that the bill will infringe freedom of speech. Whilst I never impute malevolent attitudes to my opponents, I must ask whether they know what freedom of speech is. The law in Australia allows for court action in questions of defamation, libel and slander. I will leave the strict definitions of these words to my legally learned colleagues. But everyone knows that, if Mr X says a certain thing about Mr Y, Mr Y may take legal action to punish Mr X and, most importantly, may obtain a court order to prevent Mr X from repeating his offending remark. Is this not a curbing of freedom of speech? The rules of this chamber prevent me from expressing my honest and truly held beliefs concerning some of the members of the House of Windsor. Should I begin to do so, the members for Warringah (Mr Abbott) and O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) would be quick to curb my freedom of speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, when any member here says that he or she is opposing a bill because of a question of freedom of speech, let that member also say that he or she is only a partial and qualified supporter of the practice of free speech. Let that member say that he or she does not support my right to express my views on some of the members of the House of Windsor, or the right of anyone else to express certain views on the financial probity of the member. None of us believes in absolute freedom of speech. Each of us would immediately take action to silence an offending opponent, if the rules of this House, or a solicitor's advice outside the House, made such a silencing possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to read into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> part of a letter from the former Liberal senator, Mr Chris Puplick. Mr Puplick is now the President of the NSW Anti-Discrimination Board. The letter is from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 4 November 1994, and it reads in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The experience of NSW, well tested over five years, is that appropriately drawn racial vilification laws provide the basis for public education to eliminate racism; allow conciliation to take place, to the benefit of all parties; does not impede free speech, create martyrs or drive people underground; makes a clear declaration of our public policy and provides ultimate sanctions which ought to be available in any society where respect for the rights of individuals and their protection together with promoting tolerance and social cohesion are amongst our highest and most noble goals.</PARA>
<PARA>This excellent letter from a genuine Liberal clearly captures the main points of a federal bill. It is a great pity that members opposite are so trapped by their own political frustrations that they are unable to think clearly about this matter. It is very interesting to see who is opposing this legislation. One sees a great preponderance of middle-aged white men. One does not see a lot of support for the Liberal-National position from the groups who are the regular receivers of racist abuse and violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opponents of this legislation say, and rightly so, that abusive language and behaviour already incur the punishment of the law. This is true; but it is also true that an individual act of abuse or violence should, where possible, be identified by the reason for the act of violence or abuse. The honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), Leader of the National Party, like me, is a Catholic. If last year every Catholic church in Australia had been burnt down, would he say that this was just so many hundreds of cases of arson, or would he say that there was a wave of anti-Catholic violence sweeping Australia? I think he would say the latter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, racist abuse and violence are not directed either at the honourable member for Farrer or at me, as the member for Lowe, but are directed at Asians, Jews and Arabs, not because they have done something offensive to someone but simply because they exist and are Asian, Jewish or Arab. To these people, the abuse and violence is not general and undirected. It is specific and particular. It has not happened to them as a bit of bad luck. It has befallen them from a perpetrator who was consciously looking for someone in the targeted category&mdash;just as the anti-Catholic arsonist would not look for just any building but for a particular building of a specific class. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sad fact is that nearly every member of this parliament is from the white middle class, which is the least threatened social group in Australia. Members opposed to this bill should take the time to read the 1991 report of the National Inquiry into Racist Violence, an inquiry conducted by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. What we are seeing in the opponents of this legislation is a dramatic failure of their collective social imagination. They themselves, white and well-connected, cannot imagine being non-white and isolated and subjected to a relentless regime of terror&mdash;verbal abuse at first and then possible physical terror. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give a small example. Last year the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Melbourne published a survey of 630 students in years 11 and 12 at Melbourne schools. Of the 100 Vietnamese refugee students in that group, 69 per cent said that they had experienced racism at school. Can 69 per cent of this House say that they have experienced racism at school? Fifty-nine per cent said that they had experienced it in the street. Can we say we have had that experience? And 14 per cent said that they had endured race-based physical threat or injury. The answer to each of these questions, if applied to us, would be no. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very large numbers of Australians are not like us. Many look different, sound different and were not born here. We invited them to come here and we have a duty of care towards them. The Liberal Party has a very serious problem out in the electorate. Opposition to this bill, even on the phoney `free speech' basis, is perceived as blunt indifference to a very serious problem that is encountered by very many Australians. The opposition's attitude to migrants in Australia is that they, like children, should be `seen and not heard', and this patronising attitude by the Liberals is repaid to them by migrants on election day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hold an electorate where 50 per cent of the people were born overseas or have a parent who was. To these people, racist and ethnic abuse and violence are real and painful. They do not see that some people should have the right to abuse or to bash them because they were born in Saigon or Beirut, or because they are walking into a synagogue, or because they are wearing a headscarf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberals seem to think that these outbursts of verbal and physical violence are not really serious: the woman in the headscarf who is punched is just unlucky, not Muslim; the building burnt is just unlucky and not a synagogue; the boy stabbed by skinheads is just unlucky and not an Asian. Our nation must take an implacable stand against racism. Its verbal and physical outbursts offer nothing to our future. We must have this bill and we must apply the social pressure to squeeze racism out of the Australian public arena. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Racists can scream and yell about Asians and Jews and Arabs and Aborigines and anyone else they dislike in their own homes. On the streets and in public the rights of everyone must be preserved. And the rights are not grace and favour handed out by whites as they feel like it. If we get to that stage, our country will decline as fast as those in other places&mdash;in Europe, in the Balkans and in the USA&mdash;have declined because they allowed mentally ill racists to inflame society with the curse of racism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill does not attack freedom of speech; it attacks the public tolerance of racist speech. If we declare our intolerance of racist speech, the social ethos will evolve over time away from racism. This is the aim of the bill. I support this aim and I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

These are the words that he said about the Jewish community. These are the things that he said that were endorsed&mdash;bigoted, vile things. This was not pursued by the government under any of its legislation at the time but implicitly endorsed by the bigoted Prime Minister. I read from a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> dated 16 October 1990:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hilaly arrived in Australia on a three-month visitor's visa in 1982, aroused controversy within the Moslem community which had brought him out and finally made the headlines in 1988 when he told Sydney University Moslem students that Jews were a cancer in European society, the underlying cause of all wars and that they tried to control the world through sex, sexual perversion and the promotion of espionage, treason and economic hoarding.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are the words of that religious leader, an ethnic religious leader whom your party endorsed. I displayed to the House at the time the photograph of Bob Hawke, the Prime Minister, the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) and all of that right-wing bunch from New South Wales sitting at a head table having dinner with this religious leader, endorsing these vile remarks. Talk about vilification and incitement to racial hatred, and the Labor Party took not one step against this individual. Not one step did the Labor Party take to prevent those words. The best the Australian Labor Party could do in government at that time was flick it off to the Ethnic Affairs Commission of New South Wales and hope that it would deal with it. There was not one word of racial vilification legislation at that time. There was not one word to withdraw the visitor's visa or temporary visa entrusted to that religious leader.

What are they going to do when that matter comes before the courts and the courts find that they too cannot define hatred or find a term that matches hatred because it is a subjective term?

Its behaviour demonstrates that if it is in a fundraising mode for an election campaign it will back the most vile racist statements about the Jewish community in Australia.

Those reports do not suggest criminal sanctions. In fact, they argue against that and argue for a quite different approach in the way in which the Australian government should handle these issues.

The government has asserted in the Tasmanian case that privacy is the important thing Australians need to have. It has said, `Nothing must interfere with an Australian's privacy. We will knock out every state law that stands between an Australian and his privacy.' That was the attitude. Government members come in here today and say, `Oh, freedom of speech&mdash;that's not so important. We impede that every day. No Aussie really needs to have freedom of speech. We've got laws for this and laws for that, and here we are going to knock around freedom of speech a bit more but that really does not matter.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Labor Party as a group has inconsistent values that really do not give any direction to Australia. What it is doing is just imposing a political regime because it happens to suit it. It has got no consistency in the way in which it approaches this thing. Even former Senator Walsh gave the government a real serve yesterday in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> when he raised the inconsistencies of the government's approach to basic human rights of the Australian people. It is prepared to fiddle with one in Tasmania because it suits it politically and to adopt an absolutely opposite attitude with another one because it thinks that will gain it favour with particular groups of the Australian community and in the process cause trouble for the Australian Liberal Party. The government is wrong. We have taken a stance that we believe is right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not believe that the way in which the Attorney-General has approached this is consistent or sustainable. Let me look at some of the statements and assertions that he has made. He says that racial hatred is not an everyday occurrence, and he then scratches around to find some instances of it. What he needs to do is to look at the legislation the states have, not reinvent the wheel, and to embark on an educative program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Labor Party proclaims itself to be the great advocate of racial harmony. I remember Bob Hawke doing that. I have given examples of where Bob Hawke's personal behaviour and his comments do not match up. The Australian Labor Party likes the facade of legislation but legislation without any substance behind it. It is a choice between legislation and education. The Attorney is wrong. Australian people really are some of the most tolerant in the world, and anybody that says anything different needs to look at our rating by world standards of the freedoms that we have here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard speeches in this House saying, `The Poms and our British heritage wrecked everything. If only they hadn't come, everything would have been all right.' It is the very fact that we have a parliamentary democracy and the freedom of the courts and the processes by which this country is governed that means that the Australian Labor Party is allowed to introduce the legislation that it is introducing. In many other countries, including some of our near neighbours, this could never happen, because the elitist heritage would mean that there could never be any changes. But this is a vital and open democracy, one that invites people to participate, and members of the Australian Labor Party criticise the roots of this democracy as being the very factors that restrict it. Not so. It is dynamic, it is growing and changes are being made. I think that the Australian Labor Party needs to look at where it is heading on these issues. It is writing a whole lot of new national laws that are overriding the states. It is setting an agenda and a system of attitudes or values for Australia not sought out from the Australian people themselves and is in many instances overriding the states. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to be involved in this debate today as a strong supporter of this legislation. I want to make an observation to the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), who is leaving the chamber. It concerns members of the New South Wales Liberal Party. Their support for this legislation has been stated on a number of occasions in the course of this debate. I am not quite sure how the honourable member for Mitchell marries that up with his own position or the position which was advocated by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer). The Leader of the Opposition on 26 June said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where there is incitement to violence or to damaging property on the basis of race, then there's no question that should be a criminal offence.</PARA>
<PARA>The then shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), said in February 1993:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the coalition supported the underlying principle of Labor's draft law which creates a criminal offence of racial incitement . . .</PARA>
<PARA>We can contrast that with the reports in the press of the last couple of days showing that on the surface at least the Leader of the Opposition and his now deputy have voiced their strong support for the objectives of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> that the Ethnic Coalition of Australia called on the Leader of the Opposition to honour a commitment made by the former opposition leader, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson). The current Leader of the Opposition basically said to them that if they bucketed the  opposition in the press as a result of their  position then he would deny them access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a sense what he is saying to them is, `Look, just shut up. Don't worry about the principles of free speech and don't worry about acknowledging our position. You just say what we want you to say or don't say anything.' The contradiction between the two positions ought to be obvious even to the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to refer to page 2 of yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> because I think that demonstrates very clearly the motive behind the position adopted by the opposition. The headline reads `Nats force backdown on race Bill'. The text has the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not need in this country a prescriptive piece of legislation such as the Government's Racial Hatred Act to handle racial tensions.</PARA>
<PARA>That is quite contrary to the position previously adopted by the Leader of the Opposition and the then shadow Attorney-General. I quote also this part of the same article:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The anti-legislation MPs within the Coalition claim to be taking their orders from party organisational policy. In September, the federal council of the party moved a motion opposing any legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The resolution reads that the party "strongly" opposes the Government's proposed legislation "on the basis that it would restrict our freedom of speech and prevent honest criticisms of certain unjust behaviour, religious biases and malpractices, and certain government policies which are not in the nation's best interests (eg Immigration Policies)".</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is obvious that what the opposition is all about is the position of the Leader of the Opposition. It is about the opposition's internal strife and how to maintain a leader who is just hanging on but waiting for someone to kick the chair out from underneath him. I wonder if that will be the honourable member for O'Connor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like also to make a point about people who have expressed support or otherwise for this legislation. I noted an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of Tuesday by Ron Castan, an eminent QC and civil libertarian, who was once president of the Council for Civil Liberties. In this article he said why he originally adopted an approach which might be in line with the approach of the opposition currently. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some years ago, when president of the Council for Liberties, I also opposed any laws dealing with racial vilification, on idealistic "free speech" grounds.</PARA>

<PARA>The Northern Territory does not have racial vilification laws. My electorate of the Northern Territory has not had a proud history in this regard. I refer to a part of our history which, while we all acknowledge it happened, we all wish had not happened, and that is the attitude of conservative elements in the Northern Territory community towards Aboriginal self-determination and Aboriginal rights. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Shortly after the land claim was lodged, groups such as Rights for Whites sprang up in Katherine and waged a low-level campaign that culminated in 1982 with a major street demonstration in Katherine one Saturday morning. That demonstration was led by the then Speaker of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, Les Macfarlane. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That same parliamentarian, for a number of weeks, displayed outside his electorate office a strip of racist cartoons attacking Jawoyn and other Aboriginal people in the Katherine region. The cartoons were based on crude drawings and the worst kind of racist stereotyping. I have a copy of one of the cartoons here which talks about `Katherine for whites'. What was the intent of that particular cartoon or of the march that this person led if it was not to incite racial vilification?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the period surrounding this and during the public demonstration, false claims were made about the Jawoyn people, including allegations that they would damage the local economy, restrict or prevent access to public land at Nitmiluk, and that they would be manipulated by outside forces. During this period, two senior Jawoyn men had shots fired at them. By whom? By supporters of Les Macfarlane, then Speaker of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that I have been slightly disturbed during this debate by the attitude of many of the speakers on the government benches towards those of us on this side. I was particularly perturbed by the contribution made earlier today by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) in which he attacked the National Party members of this parliament as racists and branded us all as racists. I was sitting at that time where you are, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I could not do anything about it. But had I been where I am now I would certainly have risen on a point of order and asked for the withdrawal of that, because I found it offensive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter is germane to the bill that we are talking about, because what is offensive to me may not be offensive to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) or, indeed, to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Truss. This whole bill is sinking in a swamp of poor definition. It does not define `racist'; it does not define `hatred'. Throughout it there are technical terms, but they are not conclusive at all. I believe that Australia, as a country, is noted for tolerance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know, and I recall from hearing some of the arguments put in earlier speeches today, that we indeed have a history which all of us must admit has had intolerance, bigotry and bias. I can recall as a small child being subjected to bigotry and minor physical interference because of my religion, and we did have bad times. But the Australia of the future, God willing, is going to be even better than it is now. We are a tolerant society. We are a society of great cultural diversity, and one only has to look around this parliament to see that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) leaves the chamber, I want to make a point regarding one clause in the bill. If I were to say to him, `Come outside, you white Territorian, and I will pull your nose', this bill has two years gaol for that. Of course, I respect the gentleman, and I use that example purely in a metaphorical sense, but it gives an indication of at least my understanding of this bill. If I were to say something like that to somebody, with this bill there is a prison term of two years. We have gone mad. The government has gone absolutely crazy in introducing this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We really do have, in this society of ours, great equality of opportunity. There is no doubt that there are still areas of racism, and anybody would be a fool not to say that that was the case. Whether the racism is against some people of European origin or against our Aboriginal Australians, it does exist, but I do not think that we are going to solve that by legislation. I certainly endorse the action of my coalition colleagues in coming forward with a proposition that there should be a $10 million education campaign. That is how we are going to change things. We are not going to change people's attitudes by legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find quite amazing the situation that we are going to imprison people just for words and not for acts. Let us face it: the Crimes Act in force right now has ample provision for the prosecution of people who destroy property. It is worth noting that some of the government speakers have been relying in their arguments on the three reports which were produced during 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of those reports was <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Multiculturalism and the law</EMPHASIS>, from the Australian Law Reform Commission, which concluded that the incitement of racist hatred and hostility should be made a civil offence which is dealt with by conciliation, not by gaol. The commission rejected making it a criminal offence, noting that this would unduly restrict freedom of speech. Speaker after speaker from this side of the House has made the point that there will be a restriction on freedom of speech under this bill. We are not on our own; the Australian Law Reform Commission has already reported and made that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commissioner Elliott Johnston QC, in his report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, also recommended a civil offence of the kind existing in New South Wales. He supported conciliation as a means of dealing with racial vilification, but rejected the use of criminal sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, in its report on the national inquiry into racist violence in Australia, recommended that there should be a civil offence of `incitement to racial hostility'. But the commission stressed that the level for prohibited conduct must be higher than expressions of mere ill will or conduct which results in hurt feelings or injured sensibilities. As the New Zealand experience has shown, that could lead to enormous numbers of trivial complaints. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission totally rejected the view that incitement to racial hostility should be a criminal offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is this government so hell-bent on wanting to put Australians into gaol, not necessarily for acts but for words? I just cannot believe that, towards the end of the 20th century. God knows, we went through what happened in Nazi Germany and the holocaust, and I think we are going down the same track. I see the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous), who is sitting at the table, pull a face. He may well pull a face. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Racial Hatred Bill is, in some aspects, completely contrary to those three reports that I have quoted. All three reports recommended against criminal sanctions for incitement to racial hatred or hostility. But the proposed section 60 of the Racial Hatred Bill creates a criminal offence of incitement to racial hatred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of civil offences, it was recommended that racial vilification and incitement to racial hostility be the subject of civil offences. Those descriptions do have a very high level of serious conduct. But this bill establishes a civil offence where conduct which offends, insults, humiliates or intimidates becomes the basis for action. Those words certainly include the hurt feelings, the injured sensibilities and the ill will which the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission warned should not be the basis for a civil complaint. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting, too, that when the government first brought in its bill, in 1992, it had community consultations right around Australia. There were 646 submissions on the bill received from the public, and 563 were opposed to the legislation. There were only 83 in favour of it. I think that, if one were to conduct the same exercise with this bill, one would probably get at least the same sort of response. It is interesting to see that commentators right around Australia, who are certainly not members of the Liberal Party or the National Party, are totally opposed to this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that section 60 is a denial of the right of free speech. To draw a long bow, and I will exaggerate, let us look at a scenario. When the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has achieved all of his agendas&mdash;we may be a republic, and the states and the Senate will be abolished&mdash;the next thing will be that one will get thrown into gaol for criticising the government. That is dramatic and theatrical, and an exaggeration. The parliamentary secretary need not snort, because that is the next step. I can see that, if the government were to achieve its stated scenario for changing Australia, that is where we would end up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I totally and absolutely deny being a racist, and I must say that I believe that Australia has become a far better and more enjoyable country because of migration, and because of the wide numbers of people that we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coffs Harbour, where I live, has a wonderful Italian community. At Woolgoolga, there is a very vibrant Sikh Indian community. These people are making a wonderful contribution to Australia, but we are not going to achieve anything for them by having this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed section 58 provides that it is an offence to threaten to cause physical harm to a person or group because of their race, colour or national or ethnic origin. It is an offence not only to do it but also to threaten to do it. As I said to the member for the Northern Territory before I started speaking, if I said, `Come outside, you white Territorian, and I will pull your nose,' I would get two years imprisonment on any reasonable interpretation of this clause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed section 59 provides that it is an offence to threaten to destroy or damage property because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of any other person or group. You do not have to destroy, attack or damage something; you just have to threaten to do it and this mob would throw you into gaol for one year. This is democracy? All I can say to my friends in the Labor Party in this government is, `It is about time you rethought this. Go back to the drawing board and see where this country should be going in terms of democracy.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand it is desirable that members restrict their time to allow others to speak, so I will stop now. Far from being what it purports to be, this bill is a specific attack on freedom of speech and the democratic freedoms that we enjoy in this country and which so many hundreds of thousands of our fellow Australian men and women have fought for, suffered for and died for. That is what this bill is about. It should be opposed and rejected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Racial Hatred Bill 1994 is intended to prevent people from seriously undermining racial tolerance within society. To quote the outline of the bill, this assumes evidence of seriously undermining tolerance within society by inciting racial hatred or threatening violence against individuals or groups because of their race, colour or national or ethnic origin. There is evidence of incitement to racial hatred. This has been uncovered by reports to government and has been mentioned in this debate. There is also evidence that violence has been threatened, but there has so far been no evidence of a serious undermining of tolerance within society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to undermine tolerance within society, the perpetrator would have to convince a significant number of society members to lose their tolerance. Not only is there a lack of evidence of that having happened; there is no evidence that it will happen. As members have repeatedly said, the evidence is that Australia is becoming more tolerant. Those of us over 50 have seen the extent of the vilification of Italians, Greeks in their turn, the English in the 1960s, the Chinese and former Yugoslavs, among others, drop quite significantly. People would not buy the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> today if the racist slants of its early 20th century issues were still maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Multiculturalism happened before the word was created. Australian society is quite harmonious by world standards. Australia's success with multiculturalism can easily be demonstrated in our cities and towns. Cooma's 45-year association with the Snowy Mountains scheme makes the town one of our oldest examples of multiculturalism. It happened before the word was invented. At a recent Lions convention in the town, it was observed that the club's membership history&mdash;with its Polish, Italian, Greek, German, Chinese and other backgrounds&mdash;showed how multiculturalism happened in Cooma. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians are tolerant. While there is often unwarranted prejudice, this is not so often reflected in relationships at work or at play, in the pub, in the church or over the back fence. People treat others as they find them. This is happening in the city of Queanbeyan, which has a high number of people who were either born overseas or who are the children of people born overseas. People are treating others as they find them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation will do nothing to stop the suspicion of new arrivals who have different cultures, beliefs and traditions. That suspicion will continue. The solution to those problems is education and stimulation of interests between new arrivals and others, and between others and new arrivals. It does not take long before all of us adapt&mdash;to our mutual advantage, I must say&mdash;while often still holding to those values which are precious to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not agree with some of the members who, when speaking on this legislation, have said that the bill does harmful things. I cannot see that the bill does anything that is intrinsically harmful. In fact, it is probably a useful statement of belief by a government, and can be supported in the parliament for that reason. But it will contribute little to racial harmony. What is the point of having legislation for that sort of reason? None. Legislation is not like All Bran: if it is not needed, it is better not to have it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 6 of the bill addresses acts done because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin, otherwise than in private, which are reasonably likely to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate people. Are we going to have legislation to protect the greenies when they are offended, insulted, humiliated or intimidated; or timber industry workers when they are offended, insulted, humiliated or intimidated; or members of parliament when they are offended&mdash;as we often are&mdash;insulted, humiliated or intimidated? Where will it all stop?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One consolation about the bill is that legislation can place such behaviour under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission for conciliation. But that could be done without this legislation. Legislators ought to keep legislation to the minimum necessary for protection, fairness, efficiency and other aspects of good government. This legislation, under the heading of protection, goes further than it needs to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat: education and conciliation can happen now; it is not necessary that it happen through the bill. I also repeat: there is plenty of intolerance and bigotry about. For instance, the League of Rights has been mentioned in this debate. The League of Rights has a phobia about Zionism. But that phobia is shared with quite of lot of people on the left of Australian politics; they have a phobia about Zionism too. Zionism poses some ethereal threat, which I have never been able to perceive in spite of all the writings of those who are either on the right, such as those in the League of Rights, or those on the left. Of course, the League of Rights seems to be able to link Zionism with credit cards, particularly when we are talking about the Australia card, and the Telecom centre in Deakin, ACT, where it thought there was to be a massive communications network linked with all our homes which would spy on all we are doing. They are the sorts of people, I believe, who pose problems with intolerance, but they are not the sorts of people who are able to get their message across to most of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that there is prejudice; there is prejudice against Muslims, Asians and Jews. It is true that there is abuse. I have seen orthodox Macedonian churches covered with unpleasant graffiti, and orthodox Greek churches, including the Greek church in Queanbeyan, covered with unpleasant graffiti. It is true that there has been violence perpetrated on synagogues and mosques. But I am saying that, in spite of the increased migration component of Australia, the violence, abuse and prejudice are nothing like they used to be. In fact, speaker after speaker in this debate has mentioned increasing tolerance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has a problem with the legislation in regard to freedom of speech. I am one of those people who regards people's right to privacy as being grossly exaggerated time and again in our community. We seem to forget that the natural state of humans over many thousands of years has been the tribal state in which everyone knew what everyone was doing. Privacy is starting to reach the stage that we are exaggerating to the extent to which some individual freedom of speech is being denied to people. As far as I can see, there is no real threat in this bill against freedom of speech. I was one of the proponents of the Australia Card where everyone would have an identity card. Maybe people would not take some of the chances they do if they were carrying an identity card. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition's problem is that it has, over the past year, struggled in its effort to find initiative, and its only initiative has been to follow the government, whether it has been on Mabo, the Tasmanian privacy legislation or a range of other issues. When things get too hot for some of its members, the opposition divides. Those opposite tell the government, `You are going too far.' Then they say, `We'll only go this far,' and then, `We won't go this far for a while. We are not going to do it because there is too much division within our opposition.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They could have taken the opportunity and opposed this bill instead of coming up, as they seem to be, with some wishy-washy alternative. I repeat: the things they are arguing for&mdash;education and conciliation&mdash;can happen now. They ought to have the courage of their convictions and not come up with some alternative. There is no real need for this legislation. It is harmless. Therefore, I cannot see why it cannot be supported and there is no need for what they are doing, which is even more wishy-washy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support people like Phillip Adams and Father Frank Brennan and oddly, as often happens, I support the opposition to the bill expressed by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). I did not hear his speech, so I do not know what he said in the parliament, but it is interesting how he and I quite often come to similar decisions from entirely different directions. I support all those people in saying that this legislation is not necessary. It is intended to prevent people from seriously undermining racial tolerance within society, but it assumes a serious undermining of tolerance by inciting racial hatred or threatening violence. There is no evidence of a serious undermining of tolerance within society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In Australia in 1994 no person should have to live in fear of their life, in fear of serious intimidation or in fear of violent outcomes of incitement to racial discrimination. Legislators in this parliament have a duty to all Australians to make adequate provisions to protect citizens and others from what is totally unacceptable behaviour in contemporary Australia today. Conversely, Australians, regardless of their origins, should not have to live in fear of a bill which is insufficiently clear in its definition and which could affect the lives of innocent parties in a very negative way and also neuter a community in terms of its rights to express an opinion or view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Criminal sanctions are a blunt instrument and they should be applied without question to prosecute those engaged in violent acts. But should we use such a blunt instrument as criminal sanctions to prosecute those who express a personal view? That is the question. There are a number of definitional defects in the bill. Subjectivity is always a poor basis on which to frame such important and far-reaching legislation and there seems to be a fair amount of subjectivity in some aspects of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Suggesting that the judiciary should sort out the mess that this bill potentially could create is simply highlighting the inadequacy of the drafting and the content of the bill in its present form. The bill diminishes public confidence in both the process of the parliament and, later, the judiciary, as people struggle with the consequences of such uncertainties. We in this parliament have a great duty of care to present something to the Australian people that we all understand, that we can all reasonably expect to define, and that certainly our judiciary can reasonably expect to be able to define. The use of the memorandum is simply not acceptable in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has already pointed out, Australia is not the first country to grapple with the conundrum of making laws to protect people from the horrors of racism and ignorance while, at the same time, protecting citizens' rights to freedom of speech and expression of their views. Nevertheless, this bill in its present form has chosen to ignore all of the pitfalls gleaned from a close examination of legal proceedings in other countries. Those proceedings, often after a great deal of time and cost, have shown that some of the definitions used in legislation in other parts of the world simply have not been adequate to deal with the task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only is great expense and great time consumed in sorting out these differences but also many cases overseas have been lost, and the criminals have not been brought to justice, because of the difficulties arising from the way in which the legislation has been drafted. We already have the benefit of hindsight from racial vilification legislation that has been passed in other countries and we ought to closely examine those difficulties that have been experienced and make sure that we do not go down the same path and run into the same pitfalls. Freedom of speech, as a colleague on the other side mentioned today, has never been an absolute. We have always had some safeguards and restrictions placed on what we can say and what we can write, which can lead to prosecution if it can be clearly demonstrated that that speech or that written word can seriously harm other people. Nevertheless, to pass legislation which further curtails freedom of speech we must be absolutely certain about what we are trying to achieve and ensure that we can prosecute and have the kinds of outcomes that were intended without placing undue pressure on people's right to speak up as they see fit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basis for the drafting and presentation of this legislation to the parliament at this time is no doubt to be found in some of the disturbing and very serious events which have occurred in various parts of Australia, including my own state of Western Australia. Those events, although infrequent, are cause for great concern for many Australian people, both those in the ethnic groups to which these acts were directed and those of us who feel strongly that this kind of behaviour has no place in contemporary Australia. Certain events have quite understandably given rise to great fear among certain groups in our community which have suffered both violence to themselves and to their property, and threats of violence&mdash;which, again, is quite unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that three reports have been carried out in recent times and these were the forerunner to the development of legislation that we have before us today. Those reports were quite unanimous in their direction in not imposing&mdash;in fact, some of them warned about it&mdash;criminal sanctions for incitement to racial hatred as opposed to criminal sanctions for the actual violence against persons and properties. In fact, they were nearly all very concerned that we use conciliation wherever it is appropriate to do so. That was seen as the most acceptable means of dealing with racial vilification in people's verbal and written expressions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the recommendations of the reports have not been given sufficient weight in the drafting of this bill. I think there should have been perhaps some more reading, preparation and consultation with the authors of these reports. They have gone into some considerable depth in trying to make recommendations and it would seem to me that insufficient weight has been given to these insights and recommendations in the drafting of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission rejected as a basis for civil offence the use of words which hurt feelings, for example. It was concerned that the inclusion of words in this category could lead to a large number of trivial complaints. Again, here we could benefit from the experience of other countries. New Zealand has passed legislation of a similar nature. It went down the track of including words that hurt people's feelings and provided an opportunity for prosecution. It found that there have been an overwhelming number of trivial complaints. That takes away from the serious nature of events and hinders getting on with the prosecution of people who are causing great trauma and concern within our communities. As I said before, I think we also need to become focused on what it is we are trying to achieve with this bill and to make sure that we maintain that focus on the serious issues of racial violence to both persons and property and, of course, threats of violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a great deal of discussion centred on the rights of people's freedom of speech and the rights of those for whom sometimes freedom of speech brings uncomfortable and unpleasant consequences. In an article written by Ron Castan&mdash;it was edited by Paul Austin&mdash;he makes the point that recent research suggests that incidents of racist speech and violence in Australia are increasing. That must concern all of us. He said that it is simply not the case that existing laws always adequately cover racist acts that clearly amount to threats of violence, harassment or incitement, especially in those states still without racial vilification laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He is quite right in his concerns there because, although a number of states have passed racial vilification laws, some of them clearly do not go far enough. In some states there are no laws at all. In fact, you could say that in some states penalties for violence against people's property are much more toughly applied than for violence against people. To me this seems to be somewhat of an anomaly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is an important consideration and there is no doubt in the coalition's mind that it is necessary for the Commonwealth to get on and produce legislation that will ensure that all Australians have a right to protection and that people perpetrating acts of violence against Australian people and others should be prosecuted and feel the full weight of the law upon them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Castan went on to say that, while there are some people in our community who are the subject of racial vilification and who are well connected and well educated, there are others who are not. He points out:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of them do not have QCs and politicians as their close friends. They are Arabic women who are publicly jeered at and abused because of their dress, in the suburbs of Sydney.

They are Jews abused in streets as they walk to synagogue on a Saturday morning.</PARA>

Australians do have a history of accepting into their communities people from many different countries, many different backgrounds, and of respecting their rights to live peacefully and to hold their particular views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this legislation, and in the presentation of this legislation, we must go back to the drawing board, as has been proposed by the coalition. We must redraft the legislation, again, strongly protecting the rights of those people who are subject to racial vilification, violence and harassment but, at the same time, ensuring that prosecutions will be successful and that there is a clear definition in the aspects of people's right to freedom of expression. Many of the ethnic groups in Australia have expressed that this legislation can be a two-edged sword because it applies not only between one group of people and another but also between the people of a country where there is conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have an obligation, as the law-makers and the legislators in this country, to draft this legislation with great care, ensuring that maximum protection is given to all citizens. I believe that that can be done with greater attention to the recommendations of the several committees that have reported in recent times and also with greater attention to some of the defects in legislation that the Attorney-General quite rightly pointed out has been passed in a number of countries.

But perhaps one time we could come into this chamber with a united point of view, stop the point scoring and debate legislation that is important legislation for Australia and, in many ways, is landmark legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make this point, which is not a terribly new one: I have never believed that you can legislate to change people's minds. If people have racist views or any other points of view, legislation brought in through the national parliament is not going to change them. Many people hold points of view because the attitude has been that it is logical that they have that point of view. I was born and brought up in a small country town in northern New South Wales in which there were very strong views about the Aboriginal population. There is no doubt that all the legislation in the world would not change those people's points of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, by legislation, you can make the stating of these points of view and acts of vilification illegal. In that way, you can start to change a community's attitude. I have heard a lot of debate in this parliament about educating people. Of course, I agree with that but, while you are educating the young to be a more tolerant and better rounded society, many people in the society maintain racist views and I do not believe that they should be permitted to continue publicly stating those points of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now represent what I guess would be the most diverse cultural area in Australia. This area includes the southern suburbs of Wollongong and Port Kembla. There are something like 100 different ethnic groups there. I have a large Macedonian population&mdash;who love me at the moment&mdash;a large Lebanese population, a Chilean population, some second-generation Germans and some second-generation English. In the main, these people have lived in harmony but many of these people have been subject to racist taunts and to vilification, and I believe that they should be protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I have often taken the point of view that, in many of the smaller country towns, one of the greatest defenders of racist views has been the local newspapers. Many of these local country newspapers, although they have not always been overtly racist, have been very subtly racist and have for many years been putting forward a racist point of view. If honourable members want evidence of that&mdash;as I do not represent the area any more, I can say it&mdash;they should have a look at some of the newspapers in Nowra. They have been putting out a racist message for a long time and, every week, the local people are reading that in the local newspapers. I believe that many of our smaller country newspapers have quite a lot to answer for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We have heard a lot over the last two days about freedom of speech. Nothing is absolute in this society. We can talk about freedom to use the road. There is a freedom to use the road but there are certain rules that drivers abide by. They drive on one side of the road. When going out on the road, one person does not drive on the left while another person who is going in the same direction drives on the right. If drivers exercise this absolute freedom to drive on the road in any way they like, there is going to be chaos.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the same with freedom of speech. We all support freedom of speech, but there are limits. It is a nonsense when people stand up in here and agonise publicly about the right of racists to go out and practise their craft. That is not an absolute right. There is no such thing as an absolute right. So, although we talk about freedom of speech, like all things we do, it is always tempered with a community's expectations and what we do in the community. So it is a nonsense to talk about this absolute freedom of speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also agree that Australian society has been very tolerant. As well as in Australia, I lived for 12 years in the United Kingdom. For my sins, I lived for two years in New Zealand and I also had 12 months in Malta. As some of my colleagues might also suggest, I have travelled a little as well. So I have seen other societies working. I do not know any society that has been more tolerant than Australian society. We hear about Scandinavian society. Interestingly, that famous Scandinavian tolerance tends to break down a little when economic problems come up. The guest workers of Europe were not such welcome guests when the economy was not going so well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia, not just since the Second World War but throughout its history, has always been a nation where people from many parts of the world have come, be it for the gold rush or for other reasons. In the main, and especially since the Second World War, these people have been welcomed into our society. One of the exciting things about this society is that through multiculturalism we are building a distinct Australian character which is influenced by many parts of the world. When we look at the diversity of people who have come here, we realise that we have been a very tolerant society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) speaking this morning. One of the things that gave me heart about our society concerned the Gulf War. In my area I have people who had family on both sides of the Gulf War, but the community throughout Australia and the community in the Illawarra were not arguing and fighting. Whether Irish, Yugoslavian or from other parts of the world, in the main  people do not bring the troubles from their former homeland to this country. They are so sick and tired of the problems there that they are pleased to get away from them and they do not bring them here. I want to see that continue. I do not want to see our courts full of racial vilification disputes and I do not think they will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also think it is important that we have this legislation on the statute book. We will remain a tolerant society&mdash;and, I suggest, perhaps the most tolerant society&mdash;only if we have those safeguards. One safeguard is to have this legislation on the statute book. It is a measure of our maturity that we can introduce and debate this legislation in this House. I have listened to a lot of the debate and I have heard people say that there is no need for this legislation&mdash;what do we want it for? There is a need for this legislation. If nothing else, we have to set the guidelines. Hard as it may be for many members of the federal parliament to believe, there are people out there in the community, as many speakers have said, who have been subject to racial taunts, to racial vilification and to actions that incite racial hatred. That is not the Australian way. It has never been the Australian way. We must introduce this legislation to make sure that it does not become the Australian way. That is why I strongly support this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The federal government's Racial Hatred Bill is the most recent manifestation of disturbing Orwellian tendencies in the ALP's legislative agenda. It follows in the tradition of the attempt in 1992 to ban political advertising. This bill is a smokescreen aimed at dividing the coalition. In naming it the Racial Hatred Bill, the government is deliberately attempting to incite divisiveness not just in the coalition but throughout the entire community. Hatred is such a divisive word for a piece of legislation attempting to quell such attitudes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all this legislation's good intents and purposes, the fact is that you cannot legislate to alter attitudes. This legislation will not create a more harmonious society. It will not alleviate the bigoted and racist elements of society. You cannot legislate to attempt to change attitudes and, if you do, I believe it will simply incite further racism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill inserts new criminal sanctions into the Commonwealth Crimes Act and creates a civil wrong under the Racial Discrimination Act. Threatening a person with physical harm because of his race will be made a crime punishable by two years imprisonment. Threatening harm to property on racial grounds will be punishable by one year's gaol. No-one disputes that it is wrong to threaten another person or his property. These amendments are unreasonable, however, because they do not go far enough. Does a person threatened because of the football team he supports or for no reason at all feel any less intimidated than a person singled out because of his race?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is analogous to the government prohibiting theft from migrants only. One wonders why the government is extending a protection which all Australians should enjoy only to members of minority racial groups.

I could call the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) a feral muppet. In each of these cases&mdash;I may have been defamatory in a few&mdash;we do not have legislation prohibiting these remarks which are offensive, which perhaps incite hatred and which perhaps have the possibility of causing violent reactions, just as if I called the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) a septic tank. But it seems that only the member for La Trobe would have recourse for such offensive behaviour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I apologise to the honourable colleagues whom I have just named if I have caused any offence. But I am trying to highlight the fact that racial vilification&mdash;or hatred, to echo the legislation's title&mdash;is not an orphan in the bigoted and unfortunately unkind and heartless elements of our society. We have vilification for many reasons, including sexual reasons, human characteristic or deformity reasons and personal reasons. Vilification for ethnicity is not the only basis for hatred by these bigots and forms of low-life. If we are going to have such protective laws, then why not extend them to encapsulate all forms of hatred, or is this but another cynical attempt by the government to cause divisions in our society?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further amendment to the Crimes Act will make it an offence punishable with one year's gaol to do an act with the intention of inciting racial hatred which is reasonably likely to achieve that result. On its face, that might appear to be reasonable. The section seems to protect the accused by taking into account his subjective state of mind at the time he did the act. In a criminal trial, however, the accused's evidence as to the intention with which he did an act is frequently rejected on the grounds that he would be expected to deny having guilty knowledge. Because a person's state of mind cannot be observed, it must be inferred by the court from his words and actions. For example, if I fired a bullet at a man's head, then it would be inferred that I intended to kill him because his death would be, as an objective fact, the ordinary consequence of my action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an ordinary criminal trial, such a result works no injustice to the accused. There are vested political interests on opposing sides of the question of the likely trajectory of a bullet and the consequences of it striking a human. Under political correctness law, however, there is no accepted definition of what constitutes racial hatred. Most Australians accept that statements in the form `Westphalians are racially inferior and should be exterminated' are unacceptable. Some sections of the community, however, regard any statement against the perceived interests of a minority group as racist. For example, Tracker Tilmouth of the Central Land Council reportedly claimed that the Greens and the coalition were racist for daring to propose amendments to the land fund legislation. Those with such extreme views are well represented in the race guilt enforcement industry charged with responsibility for the civil side of the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In theory, the judges who are entrusted with enforcing the Crimes Act can be expected to be more objective. The High Court has written much recently about the need for courts to take community standards into account when interpreting the law. Some members opposite would have us believe that community opinions are always the same as their own, and it takes a perspicacious judge to see through this facade. The danger is therefore that a person who makes a statement which to many of those opposite is so obviously going to incite racial hatred is likely to have his protestations that he intended no such result ignored. Consider, for example, a statement in the form, `Westphalians have a greater propensity to commit crimes than the Australian population as a whole.' Such a statement is quite likely to engender ill-feeling, perhaps bordering on hatred&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you will be aware, the APEC leaders meeting in Bogor has achieved an historic agreement for the long-term goal of free and open trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region. Only two years ago, that outcome would have been unthinkable. Specifically, the leaders committed themselves to the `complete achievement of our goal of free trade and open trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific no later than the year 2020'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">APEC today is the engine room of world economic growth and development. By 2020 APEC will include seven of the 10 largest economies in the world. Significantly, APEC includes economies at different stages of development and with economic complementarities which have not yet been fully developed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Australia the deal is of the utmost significance. The APEC economies currently take three-quarters of our exports. They represent our most important markets and our most important partnerships. This agreement offers the opportunity for an unprecedented level of integration of the Australian economy and those of the APEC countries. We have never been more ready to take advantage of the opportunities before us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we started lowering the tariff wall some years ago, we found that our industries were more than ready to take on international competition. In fact, exports of sophisticated manufactures and services have grown rapidly since the mid-1980s. Australia is already a long way down the path to free trade, having already eliminated quotas. Probably of all the countries in the region, we will have the least adjustment to make in achieving these goals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, by the year 2000 the trade weighted average tariff in Australia will have been reduced to 2.9 per cent&mdash;a position that virtually no other country in the APEC region emulates. So we have more than just about anybody else to take to the table when we enter into discussions about the processes we are all going to go through in establishing free trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region.

There has been a bit of unnecessary depression about you over the last few days.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3467" SPEAKER="Brereton The Hon L.J." NAMEID="5T4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="KINGSFORD-SMITH" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS; TRANSPORT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5T4">Mr BRERETON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I can advise the House that the Civil Aviation Authority has been conducting the most intensive surveillance of low capacity passenger aircraft and charter operators that has ever been undertaken. This increased surveillance program, led by Mr John Pike, has now been operating for four weeks. To date 733 individual inspections have been carried out, involving a total of 278 individual companies&mdash;most companies have, in fact, been checked more than once&mdash;11 individuals or companies have been the subject of enforcement action; 51 aircraft have been ordered to rectify defects before being allowed to fly; four companies have been effectively grounded following the withdrawal of chief pilot approvals. These companies are Seaview Air, Yanda Airlines, Newcastle Aviation and UZU Air. I am advised that Yanda Airlines, Newcastle Aviation and UZU Air are addressing the deficiencies found and will be able to resume operations when the CAA is satisfied that they are able to operate safely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim of the surveillance program is to identify those operators who could damage our generally very safe aviation industry. This intense scrutiny sends a very clear message to the whole of the aviation industry that safety is paramount  and must not be compromised. While every allegation raised about aviation safety is being properly and thoroughly investigated, the government has acted to address all major concerns. It has been anything but idle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to the findings of the BASI report on Monarch and the Seaview crashes, I announced a number of measures to improve aviation safety regulations. That is in addition to the parliamentary inquiry into air safety standards and the Street judicial commission of inquiry into the Seaview accident. At my direction, the Civil Aviation Authority has established a system which automatically triggers an increase in surveillance of operators who are known to be in financial difficulties. A new domestic limit of $500,000 for passenger carriers' liability has now been set in regulation. It will become mandatory and non-voidable after legislation is introduced early next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr John Pike was appointed as acting head of the directorate of aviation safety regulation on 10 October to replace Mr George Macionis. Mr Pike was formerly the Deputy Director of the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation. The Commonwealth has identified the Civil Aviation Authority in respect of its safety regulation functions to guarantee its responsibilities cannot be compromised by private indemnity insurance arrangements. On 12 October I announced that the government would lift its contribution for aviation safety regulation from $22 million to $29 million; 57 additional staff are being recruited to assist in safety regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most important decisions of the government is to remove safety regulation from the Civil Aviation Authority and to establish a separate and entirely independent statutory authority, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. Legislation is presently being drafted for introduction into the House early next year. I am also able to inform the House that, following a worldwide search, interviews are presently being conducted to appoint a new director of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this represents a responsible and comprehensive response to the concerns about aviation safety. It is completely appropriate to guarantee Australia's air safety standards. This has been in stark contrast to what we have seen from the opposition with its scaremongering tactics. All we have really seen from them is a performance aimed at providing a wholesale purge of the whole of the Civil Aviation Authority. The real question that the House should be considering is one for the member for Hume: why it is still the opposition's policy to implement full cost recovery for aviation safety activities forthwith at a saving of $20 million? That, for your information, is on page 291 of Fightback. When are you going to change it? It seems to me that the opposition has been more interested in providing information to the media rather than working constructively to ensure all concerns are properly investigated through each of the available forums.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The other claim that one hears from the opposition is that government policies have tended to compound social inequality. For honourable members who are seriously interested in this matter, I can do no better, or recommend no better starting point, than to refer to the article on these matters by Ross Gittins in Saturday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. In that article I think he succinctly put together some of the key elements of the argument, but he omitted certain key factors which I think significantly strengthen the government's position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to what Ross Gittins had to say. He made the point, which is recognised by all those who have seriously studied the issue, that over the course of the 1980s market incomes in countries in the developed world tended to become more unequal; that is to say, wages and salaries. He talked about the global factors that led to that&mdash;the fact that we are moving towards a more global economy with a global labour market and the fact that technology is tending to raise the difference in the market values of people with or without skills and education. So the growing inequality in market incomes is a feature of the developed world, and we have seen it here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ross Gittins then went on to look at the impact of government policy on that&mdash;specifically, the impact of social security transfer payments on the one hand and taxation measures on the other. What he demonstrates quite clearly, drawing on a study by Dr Ann Harding, is that the impact of government policy, through the social security system, has been to diminish that underlying trend towards greater differences in market incomes. Likewise, the changes that the government has made in the tax system, over the course of its tenure in government, have tended to diminish inequality. So the impact of government policy is quite unambiguously beneficial and benign in terms of income distribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three elements there: the underlying difference in growth in inequality in market incomes, wages and salaries, taxes and transfers. What is the impact of opposition policy in each of those three areas? With market incomes, those opposite favour a wholesale deregulation of the labour market. The international evidence is unequivocal that the countries which have gone down that path have experienced the greatest increases in inequality in earned income. So that is the starting point: market incomes unquestionably would be worse under the opposition's policy framework than they are under ours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is committed to cutting $10 billion out of social security transfers. As I pointed out yesterday, those transfer payments are overwhelmingly targeted at people on low incomes. It wanted to impose a monstrously regressive goods and services tax as well as having opposed all the significant equity measures and changes in the tax system made by this government&mdash;capital gains, fringe benefits and so forth. Whatever aspect of policy you look at, the result is unambiguous: the coalition would make things significantly worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are some points you can make drawing on Ross Gittins's analysis. But what Mr Gittins does not fully take into account is, again, the exclusion from that sort of analysis of all the social wage changes that have been made over the course of this government&mdash;and we have had an explicit trade off between money wages and social wages as part of the accord framework. It includes things like the introduction of Medicare, the huge funded increase in education participation, the spread of superannuation, the huge increase in child-care provision. The Gittins analysis does not include all the base broadening measures in the tax system, such as fringe benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you factor these things into account, the picture looks significantly better again from the government's point of view. The inclusion of the social wage components of health and housing alone has the effect of reducing inequalities by around 20 per cent, without including all the other things that I have referred to. There is no doubt as to what the impact of government policy is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to a very recent study by a very well-known academic Peter Whiteford, a senior research fellow at the University of York. He has just published a paper entitled `Income distribution and social policy under a reformist government: the Australian experience', published in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Policy and Politics</EMPHASIS> volume 24, No. 4, which is a British publication. His conclusion, looking at a comprehensive assessment of these matters, is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Living standards were higher and inequality slightly lower in 1990 than when Labor took office. If poverty is measured by reference to a constant real poverty line, then poverty had fallen substantially.</PARA>
<PARA>He also draws a very sharp contrast with the United Kingdom. His article contrasts those two countries. He states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The UK figures suggest a dramatic widening in income inequality. The Australian figures suggest a slight narrowing in income inequality.</PARA>
<PARA>So, in the face of those underlying forces driving market incomes apart, we have still been able to contain that and achieve a slight improvement in inequality. He concludes by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems fair to sum up the ALP's record as combining egalitarian social policies with economic policies attempting to enhance efficiency, within the framework of a consensual incomes policy.</PARA>
<PARA>That is dead right. That is what this government has achieved. It is a sharp contrast to what we could expect in the unfortunate situation of the coalition winning office.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LG4">Mr LAVARCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue of defamation law reform has been considered by the Commonwealth and particularly the states now for some considerable time. There have been, over the last decade or more, a number of attempts to agree on uniform defamation laws across Australian jurisdictions. The most recent was an initiative taken by Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales in 1990 which resulted in the introduction, in each of their state parliaments, of a model bill in 1991. Unfortunately, the initiative at that time floundered essentially on the dispute between jurisdictions as to whether truth alone should be a defence to an action of defamation or whether truth combined with some form of public interest or public benefit should be the defence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most significant impact in terms of defamation law reform of the recent High Court decisions has been, inasmuch as discussion and a subsequent action for defamation relates to matters involved in the political process, that the court has held that truth alone shall be an effective defence. As a result of that, it is now recognised by all jurisdictions, most notably New South Wales which had previously held the view that truth and public interest should have been the defence, that it is now to be truth alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has enabled a fairly major breakthrough in gaining agreement between jurisdictions. The last hearing of the standing committee held earlier this month agreed that a working group that had been looking at the laws in New South Wales, involving New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, would be supplemented by representatives of each of the other jurisdictions. The bill to come down from the New South Wales Law Reform Commission in the early part of next year, which will also take into account the recent High Court decisions, will then form the basis for a renewed attempt to gain agreement on uniform defamation laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the argument over the appropriate defence of truth has now been overcome effectively by the High Court decision, there are still issues to be resolved, such as whether these tests outlined by the High Court should extend into the broader community. But I am now quite hopeful that Australia will achieve agreement on uniform defamation laws some time next year. The next key date in this process will be the release of the New South Wales Law Reform Commission report and the consideration of that by Attorneys-General shortly afterwards.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am also concerned about reports that other banks are looking at introducing a similar fee structure. As far as the Commonwealth Bank goes, one newspaper report did indeed suggest that if you opt for the new streamlined express account you will be charged $4 for any withdrawal made inside a bank. So what happens if the automatic teller machine is broken down or there is a giant queue? You have to pay to go into the bank.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned especially about traditional passbook accounts and existing streamlined keycard accounts because holders of those accounts will be slugged $1.50 on every transaction if they exceed a new limit of four transactions a month. We have to work out who are the people that make that number of transactions. They are holiday-makers, backpackers, young people and pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is more, people will be asked to keep a minimum of $500 in their accounts if they want to escape a $2 monthly account keeping fee. This practice is highly discriminatory against people who prefer traditional over-the-counter service, against people who make a number of transactions each month, simply because they like to keep their money in the bank for security reasons and withdraw it as they need it, and against people who do not normally have $500 in the bank. It is also discriminatory against people who have difficulty with the English language and do not like using automatic tellers. Why should they be penalised for having to go into the bank? I am also concerned that this might be a move towards the eventual closure of branches. There have certainly been branch closures in my electorate and it is even more drastic a situation for people in rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Banking is not something we choose. People are forced, especially if they are on social security benefits, to put their money in the bank.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to reveal the hypocrisy and the dreadful track record of the opposition when it comes to wage performance and strikes during its tenure. I made it clear in the House on Monday that the key to this issue, and every other wage claim, is the approach of the parties towards enterprise bargaining negotiations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Transport employers, I must say, judging by their utterances in the last few days, understand this even if the opposition does not. The problem with past wage break-outs, particularly the huge break-out of 1982-83 that the honourable member for Bennelong presided over, was that individual employers had no say in the award based rises that occurred at their workplaces because of the centralised nature of the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The good news is that that cannot happen under the reform act because enterprise agreements have to be determined enterprise by enterprise. Indeed, wage rises at the enterprise level are insulated in the act from the award stream. If people stray outside the guidelines of the act, as I made it clear on Monday, the act provides plenty of powers to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to take any necessary action. It also puts a duty on the commission to protect the Australian economy, or any important part of that economy, from serious harm. The power is there and the obligations are there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, if we are to accept that enterprise bargaining is the way to go&mdash;and of course those sitting opposite have been preaching enterprise bargaining for years now&mdash;the fact is that we must allow employers and unions the freedom to bargain. We would be hopeful that that could be done without the need to resort to industrial action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever happens, anything the member for Bennelong or his colleagues say about this will have absolutely zero credibility&mdash;which is exactly what it should have. Anyone who was Treasurer in the early 1980s during that wages and strike spiral, as the member for Bennelong was, who claims to be an enterprise bargaining disciple these days, is certainly in no position to attack this government on its record performances on reform&mdash;and neither are any of his colleagues.</PARA>

I understand that these scams have included companies and individuals in Tasmania, whence the honourable member comes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A week ago, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS> ran a program on the issue of trade frauds which originate in Nigeria. Over the last few years, quite a number of Australian companies and Australian individuals have been targeted by unscrupulous individuals living in Nigeria in an attempt to promote fraudulent international monetary transactions under a number of different pretences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of those frauds are pretty obvious, but some of them are pretty sophisticated and a number of Australians who believed they were involved in legitimate business dealings have fallen for them. The most common approach, as I understand it, involves letters being sent by individuals, inviting the recipient to participate in a scheme which purportedly involves releasing funds which are said to be frozen by the Central Bank of Nigeria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another common scam involves requests for consignments of goods, which are supposedly to test the market in Nigeria. Once the goods arrive, the perpetrator disappears and no payment is ever made for the goods. A third sort of scheme involves business people being invited to go to Nigeria. Once they arrive, they are robbed and, in some cases, virtually kidnapped. A fourth, and perhaps the most heinous scheme, involves the targeting of charities. They get a letter saying that a wealthy Nigerian has left them a large sum of money and all they have to do is pay a certain amount in fees and charges to enable the release of this sum of money. They pay this advance sum and nothing happens thereafter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite apart from the action which has been taken by my colleague the Minister for Consumer Affairs, the Australian Federal Police has issued a number of media releases in an attempt to alert businesses to this problem.

We have also called in the High Commissioner of Nigeria to impress upon him the concern of the government. He has undertaken to convey that concern to his government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is an absolute absurdity. The fact is that the government is taking effective measures to deal with long-term unemployment. The evidence we have is that the sort of labour market and training interventions that are envisaged in the job compact and through the greatly increased labour market assistance have a major bearing on the prospects of people who have been out of work for a long time getting a job. The evidence is clear-cut that, in the absence of those interventions, the prospects of people going on thereafter to permanent work are very poor. It is demonstrable that people who participate in these programs have significantly better prospects.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Attorney-General and it concerns the liability of professionals. I ask the Attorney-General: is he aware of legislation which has just been introduced into the New South Wales parliament which apparently is designed to put a cap or a limit on the liability of professionals such as auditors? What type of effect would that proposal have on the national corporations scheme and, in particular, what effect could it have on the interests of investors in Australian firms or corporations?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3474" SPEAKER="Lavarch The Hon M.H." NAMEID="LG4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="DICKSON" MINISTERIAL="ATTORNEY-GENERAL" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LG4">Mr LAVARCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that the New South Wales parliament&mdash;indeed, the lower House&mdash;will shortly be considering legislation which will introduce a system of establishing particular standards for occupations, not only the professions but particularly the professions, and combined with that the placing of caps on liabilities of individual members of that profession.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept that the issue of liability and large claims against auditors and other professionals is of great concern. Under the current law, if someone is even marginally responsible for someone's loss through negligence, then the law of joint and several liability can mean that that individual or firm is 100 per cent responsible for the payment of the damages. This is a particular issue for auditors in relation to their work under the Corporations Law providing audit reports on Australian companies which subsequently may turn out to be inaccurate through negligence or fault on behalf of the auditor, where the company collapses and the auditor is sued as a result of that, and particularly if the directors or other malfeasants in relation to the transaction are not available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I strongly believe that the action of the New South Wales government in proposing this law at this time is at the very least premature. Firstly, a consequence of one jurisdiction going it alone on a capping regime in this regard will lead to considerable anomalies in relation to the overall liability system, particularly that which applies to our national company law. We will see a situation, I believe, of mere forum shopping as companies seek to gain auditors from other states where there is not a cap in place. So I do not see that it is going to particularly advantage the profession in that sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, we have seen a joint attempt by the Commonwealth and the government of New South Wales to examine the underlying problem of the law of joint and several liability. The ministerial council in this area will be receiving a report from Professor Davis of the Australian National University on this only next month. It is disappointing that the New South Wales government cannot wait until that report is received.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of capping will simply shift the problem; it will not solve the problem. It is unfair to those who have suffered loss and it also weakens the basic structure of the Corporations Law, which places an important role on auditors in terms of their checking of the legitimacy of company accounts and the investor protection which flows from it. So for those reasons I would ask the New South Wales government to think again about proceeding with this legislation and wait at least until such time as we have had a chance to consider the recommendations of law reform and the underlying problems of the law of joint and several liability.</PARA>

If there are stoppages and if our Christmas is ruined by the industrial action of the Transport Workers Union, nobody in Australia will carry more responsibility for that than the federal Minister for Industrial Relations&mdash;the man who wants to disappear from industrial relations, and indeed who ought to disappear from industrial relations; and the man who has made a failure of industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Years ago his great mate the Prime Minister, when ballots were being rigged in the New South Wales ALP, called him Danger Man&mdash;an allusion to Patrick McGoohan. That term has a certain relevance to today's circumstances. The Minister for Industrial Relations is a danger to Australia's industrial relations. He is a direct danger to our transport system. He has presided over a ramshackle failure of administration, and he ought to have the guts and the sense of personal responsibility to resign over the total breakdown of his administration of the Department of Transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My remarks are directly related to his failure as an industrial relations minister. On three counts he is directly responsible for the union militancy that now threatens to interrupt the peaceful and happy enjoyment by Australian families of the up-coming Christmas period. The first count is his changing of the Industrial Relations Act to encourage the very action which is occurring at the present time. With those changes of last year, he took out of the Industrial Relations Act the secondary boycott provisions that provided protection against the very sort of action the Transport Workers Union is now threatening. What is the Transport Workers Union threatening to do? It is threatening to boycott the supply of goods and services to companies like Woolworths, Coles and all the other major retailers of Australia. That is secondary boycott action, which can now be carried out with total immunity and total impunity by any offending union. That was not possible under the former act; it was not possible under the legislation that had been introduced by the Fraser government. That was not possible until Danger Man over there worked his wicked will and destroyed those effective sanctions against that kind of predatory union conduct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second count relates to changes to the act. He has taken away the legal restraints on strikes that occur during the bargaining period between a union and an employer. Effectively, a union can now seek to bargain in good faith under the bargaining good faith provisions of the new act, can make a claim on the employer and, while the employer is responding, can go on strike while being completely immune from any kind of legal action resulting from that particular strike. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final criticism I make of the minister is that he belongs to a government whose leader, the Prime Minister, deliberately talked up the 15 per cent wage claim by the Transport Workers Union. Last week the Prime Minister of Australia went on the John Laws program. Instead of exercising the sense of responsibility that was exercised by the Treasurer, who expressed concern about that 15 per cent wage claim, and instead of recognising that Australians would like to enjoy the Christmas that is about to come after five years of the recession we had to have, the Prime Minister deliberately decided to talk up that claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those three reasons, this government and this minister are directly responsible for the fact that the Transport Workers Union right now, as I speak, is threatening to interrupt supplies of food and beer, Christmas travel, and deliveries of cash to employers to pay Australian workers so they can buy toys for their children at Christmas. All of the things that Australian families take for granted at this time of the year are under threat because of the industrial relations failure of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has presided over a deterioration in the industrial relations law of this country. In the few minutes that remain, I will give honourable members a real, live, contemporary example of just how bad the minister's industrial relations act is. I know that my Western Australian colleagues&mdash;indeed all of my colleagues&mdash;will know where Geraldton is. There is a retirement home in Geraldton for returned service men and women which is run by the local RSL. The story I will tell you is about the `Geraldton Five', as I christen them&mdash;five employees of that retirement home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many years they were working under a state award covered by the Western Australian industrial relations legislation. Under the new legislation introduced by the Court Liberal government in Western Australia, those five people decided to negotiate a workplace agreement. Under that agreement they got more money; they got a higher annual wage; they were able to eliminate the shift penalties which, you can understand, are a real pest when it comes to running an operation that needs 24-hour care and 24-hour service, as a retirement home does. In every respect they were perfectly happy with the arrangement that they negotiated. In the course of the negotiation, they consulted the union, and the union's advice was ignored. They signed this workplace contract and happily went about their way with higher wages and better conditions. But they did not bargain on what the union would do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The union decided to apply to the federal Industrial Relations Commission, under your act, to get an interim order to restore the old state award. The joke does not end there. It was successful in obtaining that interim order. The federal Industrial Relations Commission has temporarily reinstated the state award which those five people rejected. That is despite the fact that those five people freely and voluntarily entered into that workplace agreement; it is despite the fact that they were getting more money under that agreement; it is despite the fact that the firm that they work for has got a better operation; and it is despite the fact that the patients in the nursing home are getting more relevant and more uninterrupted care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite all of those facts, somehow or other, this government's philosophy on industrial relations was interfered with. Those five people are now forced back into working under the state award. That is despite the fact that, in the course of the hearing, they swore and filed affidavits with the federal Industrial Relations Commission saying that they were perfectly happy with the arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the female employees of the nursing home said to a member of the Western Australian parliament, `The thing that angers me most about what has happened to me is not the fact that I am getting paid less money as a result of having to go back under the state award; it is that for the first time in 15 years, through the flexibility of this arrangement, I had been able to get a happy accommodation between my work responsibilities and my family responsibilities.' That is something that is of enormous concern and worry to working families in Australia. One of the great unresolved problems in Australian society is how people effectively blend work and family responsibilities. You are to blame for that woman being denied that effective blending. It is your legislation, your craven cave-in to the trade union movement of Australia, that has made it possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say `thank you' to you, Minister, for one thing: you warned me during question time about one of your lines of argument. You said that the level of industrial disputation and the industrial record of this government are superior to that of the Fraser government. This mob is very good at telling Richardsons. Nobody is better at telling Richardsons than one of Richardson's old mates who sits opposite me. One of the great canards I would like to put down is this claim that, in some way, the industrial record of this government is better than that of the Fraser government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you look at the period between 1977 and 1982, Australia's industrial record compared with that of the rest of the world was relatively better than it has been during the last five years under your administration. You can carry on. If you dispute what I say, I quote you the magazine that the Prime Minister is always tugging his forelock to&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> magazine of January of this year&mdash;which proves that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final thing that I say to you is that if you get on to 1981-82, could I remind you that at the 1986 national conference of the ALP, your Prime Minister attacked George Campbell. He said, `George, you've got 100,000 dead men hanging around your neck.' He was referring to the dead men who lost their jobs because of the irresponsible union campaign during 1982, an echo of which is the irresponsible union campaign of the Transport Workers Union in 1994.</PARA>

The member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) should be the last person in this parliament to attack our government on wages and the threat of strikes. He was the Treasurer in a government which presided over a wages spiral, industrial chaos&mdash;he cannot deny it&mdash;double-digit inflation and double-digit unemployment. His record as Treasurer was one of the worst in the whole history of Australia. It is his personal albatross hanging right around his ears. Now he comes into the chamber today and attacks our government&mdash;a government that has delivered the lowest annual level of industrial disputes for 50 years; a government that has delivered on wages moderation, that has seen inflation at less than two per cent and record employment growth. That is our record, and we are justifiably proud of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only this week the member for Bennelong stood in this parliament and attacked our bill to mainstream the Coal Industry Tribunal, even though that bill had the support of both employers and employees. He attacked it vehemently, but he did not oppose it. He knew that, yet again, it was something we had done which in his many years he had failed to do. Today he attacks us over enterprise bargaining and the claim of the Transport Workers Union when he knows that he himself has been the leading advocate of a decentralised system of bargaining in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What angle does he choose today&mdash;section 45D. Ho-hum, what a surprise! When it comes to 45D, he is capable of saying anything at all. Today he said that there is no protection  from secondary boycotts, but he knows there is, and he knows that the protection is more than adequate. We have just made secondary boycott legislation apply to secondary boycotts. We have simply taken away the blatant anti-union bias and the primary boycott application of the previous legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He hates what we have done. He hates it with a passion. Well might we ask: why does he hate it? Why does he hate any changes to section 45D? It is because old section 45D was the only thing he ever did while he was in government. Did that section 45D do anything to stop the strikes or the wage explosion of 1981, 1982 or 1983? Did it stop any of that? Not on your nelly. Of course, all of the other achievements that he claims are vicarious. He says that he talked about financial deregulation. But did he do it? No, not on your nelly. He said that he wanted to float the dollar. But did he do it? No, not on your nelly. He said that he wanted foreign banks in Australia. But did he do it? No, not on your nelly. Then he said that he wanted enterprise bargaining. But he could never deliver it. No, not on your nelly. Three times the electorate has been served up with his brand of anti-union, anti-employee bargaining, and each time it has been comprehensively rejected by the Australian electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is always someone else's fault, never his. That is what he kept saying in the recent ABC television program on the Liberal Party. In 1987 it was Joh's fault. In 1990 it was Andrew Peacock's fault. In 1993 it was Jeff Kennett's fault or John Hewson's fault, with his $3 youth wage. When he was in government, it was all Fraser's fault. It is always anyone else's fault but his own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even when the opinion polls show that the electorate thinks our policies on IR are better and they consistently rate our policies as being twice as acceptable as those of the opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong says that there is nothing wrong with his beloved Jobsback. That was until recently, when the opt-in arrangement was changed to an opt-out one. Something that he claimed earlier was a major feature of his policy was abandoned unceremoniously just a few short days ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Well might we ask what prompted the change. Why this sudden change of heart? The last time that he had a change of heart was in 1955. We might well ask what changed his mind last week. The performance of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) changed his mind. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said, it was when the opposition leader started going bad that the member for Bennelong again started to hear the age-old voices. Of course, a lot of those voices were from the moderates within his own ranks whose votes he needs in order to topple the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do these moderates want him to do? They want him to soften up Jobsback. They know that it is unacceptable. They want it to be made more saleable. In the current climate, the member for Bennelong said, `Yes, I will agree.' He even had a press conference and, of all things, talked about a transparent safety net. He was prepared to even borrow our rhetoric in an attempt to look flexible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> yesterday, we saw the member for Bennelong assuring everyone that the four pillars of Jobsback would be retained.

They might appear to have been changed, but in reality he is incapable of change. The truth of the matter is that he has never been able to change.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As bad as the current Leader of the Opposition is, he has one advantage, which is that he really does not believe in anything. But everything that the member for Bennelong believes in is truly outdated. He has got strong beliefs, but each and every one of them is outdated. The ABC program, more than anything else in these last several weeks, has illustrated that and reinforced it with the whole of the Australian electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong is really yesterday's man. For one thing, he is certainly not yesterday's hero; there is no way in the world that he is. The fact is that his IR policies are yesterday's policies. Listen to the speeches that he delivers in the House. They all sound like the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of ten years ago, and you know it. Today's rant and rave is no different again; it is vintage member for Bennelong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said on Monday that strong rules govern the behaviour of unions and employers in the bargaining process. They certainly do. Yet, in enterprise bargaining, it is up to the parties to determine outcomes. Employers can determine what they can afford to pay. That is something they could not do back in the time of the wages push of 1982-83, when the member for Bennelong was in the chair as the treasurer of Australia. If both sides act within the law&mdash;and I am pleased that the Transport Workers Union has publicly indicated as late as yesterday that it intends to&mdash;we have to simply allow the bargaining process to work, unless we want to go back to the centralised system. I do not think anyone in the opposition is suggesting that; the opposition wants an enterprise bargaining system without anyone being able to cut a bargain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For my part, I have never thought that the employers in the transport industry were pushovers of any sort. Those opposite appear to me to be the only ones who are of that view. They seem to think that 15 per cent claimed is 15 per cent achieved. Let me point out that not even Jennie George of the ACTU would be as confident of that as those opposite would pretend to be. Those opposite say that they hate the accord&mdash;but, of course, they would like to see a regulation of wages claims. You hope that there is no large-scale industrial action; we certainly hope that there is no such instance. You claim that there is nothing to prevent any unauthorised or highly damaging industrial action; however, you know that on Monday I outlined all of the provisions in the Industrial Relations Reform Act which will guarantee that the law is upheld. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the government's part, we will monitor the situation in the transport industry, just as we have monitored in bargaining generally the encouraging progress&mdash;progress that has seen bargains in the federal system achieve 56 per cent of all federal award coverage, with the best performance from the states being 14 per cent in Queensland, and with not one of the conservative states yet to make double figures. That is the success that we have had. We certainly will also be making sure that we maintain the overarching framework of the accord to help keep inflation and the safety net wage rises quite modest in their impact. That is, after all, the very underpinning of the accord. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I will say this: we will also guarantee the protection of the safety net itself, unlike those opposite who would tear it down. The formula of the safety net has worked well for us over the whole of the last decade; I believe that it will continue to do so as we go forward into this decentralised system. As I have indicated to the House, already our model of a decentralised system is working far better than are all of the conservative models. That is really the reason why it is so easy for me to come into the House today and dismiss performances such as we have seen from the member for Bennelong. We need only point out to him again and again the dismal record that was his, both in and out of government. That does more to discredit him and anything he might say than anything else possibly could. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, I think it is time for the House to reject the tired leadership plea that we have seen this afternoon. You must ask yourself about the Leader of the Opposition, though. To let the member for Bennelong have this platform today, the Leader of the Opposition must either be so sure of himself after his performance of the last 48 hours, or so stupid; or maybe it is the fact that the Leader of the Opposition knows that, given a quarter of a chance at the microphone here in the House, the member for Bennelong cannot change his spots. He is locked into that time warp of the past, with the same tired old rhetoric and the same failed old policies&mdash;the policies which have been rejected again and again by the Australian electorate and which in every survey are shown as still being utterly unacceptable to them. I think it is time for the House to reject the policies of the member for Bennelong and get on with the job of making sure that the area of industrial relations in this country continues to prosper in a way that it never did under any conservative government. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister ran an interesting line of logic in his remarks. He was blaming the member for Bennelong for the strikes that took place at the time the member for Bennelong held the position of Treasurer. If the member for Bennelong were to be held responsible for the strikes which have been referred to&mdash;strikes which were in an area not directly within his portfolio&mdash;I would think that the present Minister for Transport, now leaving the House, at least has to take some responsibility for the planes which have been falling out of the sky, an area which is directly within his portfolio. But the minister even tries to pass the buck on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are discussing this matter of public importance some 5 1/2 weeks before Christmas when Australians will be looking to sitting down with their families around the home table and enjoying themselves over Christmas dinner. But it appears that this year, regrettably, that enjoyment is in danger of being severely diminished. This government, under its incompetent minister, has put in place a disastrous industrial relations policy that has made possible the threatened Transport Workers Union strike which is facing us today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Transport Workers Union is flexing its muscles and threatening to strike for a 15 per cent wage rise. I do not have to tell members in this chamber the consequences of that if it comes about. There will be a whole host of flow-on effects, not the least of which will be inflationary ones. We are just starting to reverse the disastrous job situation in this country today. It is at a very tentative stage and the intended strike will present a lovely Christmas present to a number of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I saw a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> newspaper this morning referring to a Yellow Pages small business index survey showing that 33 per cent of non-farm small businesses surveyed in areas affected by severe drought fear they will be forced to close, while 50 per cent of them did not think they could last another year. If we get that sort of nonsense about wage rises coming out of the Transport Workers Union, presided over by the Minister for Transport, the situation will become even worse than it is now. Enterprise bargaining, which the minister was just bragging about, is an absolute farce federally in this country today, as any employer will tell you, and people are losing faith in the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look at the players surrounding this strike. First of all, there is the TWU federal president, Steve Hutchins. Let us look at the mentality of some of the statements that he has made when demanding his 15 per cent wage rise at this critical time. He says that, if the employers force the TWU to use `guerilla' style industrial tactics to achieve its pay claim, that will be their choice. What a way of twisting the whole situation around. This is what we are up against these days.

<PARA>There you are&mdash;a damming indictment indeed of the present minister for both transport and industrial relations. Both these union officials said they were going to target the retail sector and the armoured car transport sector that delivers wages and retail takings to banks, et cetera. Their aim in this action is to starve the shops of goods in the lead-up to Christmas and to stop the money getting to the banks. It is a very critical time for retailers at the moment. They have been hanging on by the fingernails, to use the words of one of the retail representatives in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Assisting in all of this is the ACTU secretary, Bill Kelty, who gives strong endorsement to this claim. There are other people, like Jennie George, offering their support, and there is the minister himself, L.J. Brereton, who is so weakened, so powerless to do anything. When he gets up to give a shortened speech he can do no more than wring his hands, hoping it will all go away. He could not even answer a question today on secondary boycott provisions. He talked about everything else but. He does not seem to have a grasp of his portfolio at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequences of all this are that grocery stores with perishable goods will be in danger; departmental stores which had a turnover of $950 million in November and which are looking to boost that to $1,700 million in December to keep going will be in jeopardy; and wholesalers and liquor outlets which will be looking to up their trade in December will also be put in jeopardy. In fact, the entire retailing sector is looking to boost its turnover from $8.6 billion to $11.3 billion in December. All that has now been put on the backburner. It is a very serious situation indeed, which is why we have brought this MPI before the House today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very instructive to look at how this strike came about. I think there are six ingredients to it. Firstly, the high capital intensive nature of the industry makes it vulnerable to union muscle and leverage. Secondly, vulnerable industries starved of cash flow are waiting for their profits to flow through in December&mdash;a traditionally good trading month in the retail industry. Thirdly, Christmas is coming up, and what usually happens every Christmas is that beer carters go on strike. This year the union movement is using a bit more imagination and widening the range of goods that it will be denying stores when it exercises its union muscle. Fourthly, militant union officials in the workplace&mdash;I have just given examples of the language some of them are using&mdash;have no care whatsoever for industry profitability. </PARA>

Opposition members say that business organisations have the right of collective bargaining. They distinguish between the individual and the corporate structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a major fundamental difference between opposition members and those of us on this side of the House. When we look at what the conservatives in this country do, when we look at Western Australia and Victoria, and when we look at the Fightback policies and enunciations from the conservatives on what they would do if they were in government, we know that they would remove the safety net. They would pull the safety net right away. That is what Mr Court wants to do in Western Australia; that is what Mr Kennett proposed in Victoria. They say that workers have to go out as individuals and fight for whatever dollar they can get from within the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Kennett is a good friend of members on the other side and someone they fully support. They say that he is doing the right thing for industrial relations. Mr Court is also well supported on the other side. They say that his approach to industrial relations is very proper and appropriate. They introduced legislation in their state parliaments which pulled away the safety net and removed the rights of the individual salary and wage earner to collectively bargain. They say that is desirable. They say that, economically, that is good. They say that no individual should have a minimum standard of wage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find this very strange coming from the conservatives, because they sit here in this House and argue for individual rights. They argue that every Australian has certain individual natural rights. They go back to Adam Smith and say that this individual right cannot be contracted away. It is an inherent right of the human soul and the human spirit. It is most confusing when, on the one hand, they believe this as a fundamental principle yet, on the other hand, deny collective bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They put forward a very confusing argument. They say that the ordinary salary and wage earner has the fundamental human right to collectively bargain with his or her employer, but when a bundle of workers sit down and say that they want to combine their individual rights into a collective the member for Bennelong says that is not a right they have. That is his argument. He denies them their fundamental right. Although he will argue for individual rights, he will deny the right of the individual to join a collective. This is one of the strangest notions the conservatives or the tories of this country want to run with. I get very worried when I think about them getting into government in this country and their views, as expressed through Mr Court and Mr Kennett, becoming federal law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has never been a more confusing industrial relations system implemented in this country than the system in Victoria&mdash;one which has demonstrably failed and one which the private sector, to its credit, says does not work. It is a disaster. it is designed to take away safety nets, yet that is what those opposite support. I have heard no-one from that side of the House criticise Mr Court for his disastrous industrial relations legislation. I have not heard the member for Bennelong stand up in this place and say that the failed industrial relations policy of the Liberals in Victoria is wrong. I have not heard him stand up once and say that it is a disaster. His natural colleagues, the business sector, constantly say that it is a failure and that it does not work. The inconsistencies are glaring and constant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that the worker who has only one thing to sell&mdash;the only economic value is his or her labour&mdash;should not be treated as an individual because the individual cannot under any circumstance compete against a collective, the corporation, or against the multiple employer groups. You deny that right to them consistently. You totally deny it. </PARA>

Why do you consistently ignore the Pope's rulings in several encyclicals on the right to strike? Why do you ignore that right?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do you who parade your virtues and your Christian values so well ignore the Christian teaching on the most fundamental right&mdash;the right to withhold labour? You stand here today and say that no worker has the right to withhold labour. You criticise him as being part of an ambit claim, as being part of the negotiation for a change in working conditions. You stand here and parade your ignorance&mdash;that is what it is&mdash;and you ignore vital and fundamental rights in the very arguments you put. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened to the debate. Those of us who are mature, who are at least grown up, know that ambit claims are very broad. We all know that there is an ambit claim in the marketplace. At least I know. You might be ignorant. You probably do not understand industrial relations. You always sound pretty ignorant in this place on these issues. So when there is an ambit claim one would expect the current negotiations and public stances being taken by the Transport Workers Union and the employers. There is nothing new in it. One would think from listening to this debate that the world is about to fall down on us and that Christmas is going to be abolished by the workers. That is what you have been saying in this House. So it is an ambit claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do, quite proudly, have in this House a decent, honest system of industrial relations&mdash;not a system supported by Court, not a system supported by Kennett and not a system supported by you, thank God&mdash;which will enable these negotiations to work through their proper processes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of a new chancery at Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea.</PARA>
<PARA>The main elements of the proposed work are: the construction of a five-level purpose-built chancery; a flat grassed recreation playing area with associated facilities including toilets, showers, a change room and a services building; staff and visitor car parking; and associated site works, services and landscaping. The total estimated cost for the works at February 1994 prices is $22.260 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Five contracting companies with significant Australian association have been invited to tender for the managing contractor role of the works. Tenders will close on 1 December 1994. Subject to parliamentary approval, the contractor will be appointed during January 1995. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works has made the following recommendations in its report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the committee again draws attention to the continuing difficulty it faces in assessing overseas projects as, under current legislation, it is unable to meet outside Australia or its external territories. Until this legislation is amended to enable site inspections to be carried out overseas, the committee continues to reluctantly give approval for the construction of projects which, in its view, it has been unable to properly assess. I can tell the committee that I will be in Port Moresby on Monday and will inspect the site on its behalf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the structure of the present chancery does not conform to the current design codes for seismic performance. The building requires major refurbishment, does not meet the latest security requirements and was not planned to cater for the present staffing levels and functions of the high commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, a need therefore exists to provide a new chancery in Port Moresby which will provide a safe working environment. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifthly, the committee recommends that the Commonwealth Fire Board and the committee be kept informed of the results of the risk analysis-cost benefits study of fire protection to be carried out in the new chancery.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sixthly, the committee recommends that the Overseas Property Group advise it of the results of the survey into the past uses of the site, as well as the results of the munitions search. The Overseas Property Group will advise the committee of the results of both the survey and the search. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Seventhly, the committee commends the Overseas Property Group on its willingness to consult with the Community and Public Sector Union in its planning process for this proposal. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ninthly, taking into account the reservations expressed in recommendation 1, the committee recommends the construction of a new chancery at Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea at an estimated cost of $22.260 million at February 1994 prices.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was speaking prior to question time about how one defines racism for the purposes of the Racial Hatred Bill. Consider, for example, a statement in the form, `Westphalians have a greater propensity to commit crimes than the Australian population as a whole.' Such a statement is quite likely to engender ill feeling&mdash;perhaps bordering on hatred&mdash;towards Westphalians. Such a statement might well be true, but truth has not been made a defence to a prosecution under the new law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There should not, in any case, be a requirement that every public statement likely to offend someone must be true. The cause of establishing the truth is best served by allowing free and unfettered debate on all subjects, without the losing side having to fear a punishment for being in `error'. In any case, there is no reliable means of determining the truth of many propositions in the field of social science. Like truth, public interest, although available as a defence to the civil offences, will not be a defence to a criminal prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A new section to be inserted into the Racial Discrimination Act will impose civil penalties on those who offend, insult or humiliate a person because of his race. One could then be sued for calling someone a wog. There is no doubt that one should not call anyone a wog. One should not call anyone fat or ugly either, but are such momentary slips of the tongue to be punished by grinding litigation followed by a damages bill in the thousands of dollars? To outlaw name calling is to go beyond the nanny state. Even the nannies have a rhyme about sticks and stones for use in such cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As though there were not enough burdens on the business community as it struggles to emerge from the recession, the bill drafts employers as unpaid police to enforce politically correct morality. Proposed section 18E of the Racial Discrimination Act will make an employer responsible for the racist comments of his workers, unless he takes all reasonable steps to prevent them from occurring. Just what constitutes all reasonable steps is far from clear. No doubt the human rights commissioners will be pleased, when awarding damages against `errant' employers, to inform them of what they should have done to avoid the penalty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite interesting that many members opposite, quite rightly, expect those accused of traditional wrongs to be accorded the most stringent procedural safeguards. Yet, when a person is accused of infringing politically correct morality in the civil sphere, his rights practically disappear. The complainant, regardless of his means, has at his disposal the resources of the state to conduct an investigation of the offence. The respondent is required to answer the questions of the investigating officer. Is racism a greater evil than murder that one accused of the latter deserves the right to silence but one accused of the former does not? It seems that it is considered better to punish 100 innocent men than let a guilty racist go free. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we must treat various politically incorrect `isms' as civil wrongs&mdash;and there is no doubt that we should not&mdash;at the very least let the complainant have to bring an action for damages in the same way as he would against, say, a negligent driver. A complainant in a political trial need not fear an order for costs if his complaint is dismissed. This powerful check on the commencement of unfounded proceedings in an ordinary civil case does not apply in the politically correct tribunals. A successful defendant will still be left with a large bill for legal costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People found guilty of infringing political correctness can obtain awards of damages of a level which, in the personal injury field, one would need to be seriously hurt to receive. Instead of being heard by partisan commissioners, these cases should be heard by judges with a wide range of experience of real crimes so as to be able to keep in perspective a complaint of hurt feelings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All laws restricting speech contain a penumbra, a twilight zone in which a person cannot be sure if his statements infringe the law, and therefore cause the prudent and the timid to refrain from making a much wider range of statements than the law intended to prohibit. Sanctions imposed by the courts will probably not be the major practical impediments to free speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who control access to the forums for disseminating ideas&mdash;the publishing houses, the media and academia&mdash;will be forced to walk on egg shells when dealing with any issue touching on race. They will, most perhaps from a genuine desire to act lawfully&mdash;but some from a cynical desire to suppress debate&mdash;cite the law as a reason not to publish anything at variance with contemporary wisdom on multiculturalism. All decent Australians recognise and shun a genuine racist, and that is the most appropriate sanction for the boorish and bigoted members of the community. We do not need to make them into martyrs and begin a race litigation lottery in the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Racial Hatred Bill is junk law, the legislative equivalent of the Big Mac. Although racism is a real evil, the bill is an ill-conceived and draconian reaction to a problem which can only be dealt with through education. This bill proposes to crack walnuts with a sledgehammer, and it will break up the pavement at the same time. This bill is about punishing errant thought. Violent acts are already prohibited by law. If threats are not already prohibited, then they should be, but on a non-discriminatory basis. The new law will punish only those who do such acts with particular thoughts in their mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government is running the country in the way that undergraduate radicals run student unions: fervently devoted to banning politically incorrect behaviour while their finances are in ruin. The Republican landslide in the United States was a backlash against the combination of fiscal irresponsibility and the socially engineered state. America gave us the intellectual virus of political correctness in the first place, and one hopes in the near future for the arrival on these shores of the antidote. </PARA>

Quite frankly, whilst I have listened to a number of speeches made by those on the other side and have listened to some of the critics of the bill, I think there is a bit of a misconception. Certainly, some inconsistencies are flowing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be understood that there are limits to free speech all around the place. You have only to pull out the New South Wales Crimes Act to see penalties that one could argue limit free speech. The Commonwealth Crimes Act is another act that one could argue limits free speech. It is really a question of what we, as a community, need to say about certain behaviour. I endorse the comments of my colleague the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), who said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation asserts our values as a community. It is about community values. We are saying that this sort of activity cannot and will not be tolerated.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree with him wholeheartedly. I am not walking away from the fact that there are criminal sanctions in this bill, but I do not come to this debate as a hanger and a flogger, as someone who has a prosecution history; I come to the debate as someone who has spent a decade as a legal aid solicitor and a legal aid barrister defending people charged with serious criminal offences. I have never prosecuted anyone in my life and I have no intention of prosecuting anyone. But, when it comes to behaviour, we as legislators need to sit back and say, `What is the conduct we are looking at and is it deserving of criminal sanctions?' I say to members of the opposition that the conduct we are discussing at the moment that attracts criminal sanctions is deserving of criminal sanctions. Frankly, it is an overlay of existing conduct that is currently regarded as criminal and attracts penalties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great defenders of free speech in the opposition&mdash;as they would have us believe&mdash;are celebrating the 50th anniversary of their party this year. We hear about the great founder, Sir Robert Gordon Menzies. What was his contribution to free speech? It was the Communist Party Dissolution Bill. When he could not get his way, he attempted to have a referendum. He was defeated in a campaign by the then Leader of the Opposition, Dr Evatt. What also was his record? Do we remember Fitzpatrick and Browne, who were brought before the bar of the House in 1955? It was the then Prime Minister, Robert Gordon Menzies, who moved the motion in the House that saw those people imprisoned for three months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Monday week, we saw protesters ejected from the gallery. The law as it stands&mdash;the Parliamentary Privileges Act and the Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act 1971&mdash;enables protesters in the gallery to be dealt with and to be imprisoned, in some instances for three months and in others for six months. Where is the argument that that is an inhibition of free speech? Similarly, penalties apply to people who display posters in the gallery. The trouble here is that there is some inconsistency. I suggest that some members of the opposition are acting like precious little petals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will read the particular parts of the legislation that relate to acts constituting criminal behaviour. I am particularly interested in proposed section 58, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a person must not threaten to cause physical harm to another person or a group of people because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the other person or of some or all of the people in the group.</PARA>
<PARA>Imprisonment for this offence is set at two years. In New South Wales, the offence of indictable common assault carries a penalty of two years imprisonment. Whosoever assaults any person, although not occasioning actual bodily harm, shall be liable to imprisonment for two years. The point I want to make in relation to that is that assault can be occasioned by using words and by putting someone in fear. I suggest to people participating in, and listening to, the debate that the penalties we are bringing in through this legislation are not over the top. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are adding an extra element. We are not doing what the heroes in New South Wales are doing with their Community Protection Bill. Cop this: the Community Protection Bill that is currently lying on the table in the New South Wales parliament deals with preventive detention. It means that people can be detained in a prison for two years if a court is satisfied that they are more likely than not to commit a serious act of violence. That two-year imprisonment can be renewed. People can be put in prison for what they think. People can be put in prison on a civil standard; namely, on the balance of probabilities rather than for any crime being proved against them beyond reasonable doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not what this legislation does. It retains the criminal standard. Each element of the offence has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt and the prosecution bears the burden. It is not reducing the standard. In my opinion, there is no doubt that, to some extent, its conduct is picked up in existing state legislation. But I suggest that this is alternative legislation and that we are adding aggravating features. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some states do not have legislation in existence. If people paint a synagogue or paint this parliament, they can be dealt with for malicious damage. But surely racist slogans and swastikas are aggravating features that can be taken into account not only by the sentencing judge but also in the sort of offence people are charged with. Here you would have a situation where&mdash;providing there is sufficient evidence&mdash;if slogans inciting racial hatred are displayed and people are brought before the courts, they can be charged with alternative charges. It is the best form of education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have just had a press release from the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Sir Ronald Wilson, which says this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . "No fair-minded Australian will tolerate the public expression of racial vilification or racial hatred. Australia has had many successes in promoting tolerance within its diverse population, but public inquiries over the past few years have revealed a problem of sufficient significance in many parts of Australia to justify the development of a more effective national remedy."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since legislation in this area was proposed at a federal level two years ago, the Commission has received many expressions of support from a wide range of communities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sir Ronald said: "The Commission recognises that while legislation alone will not change attitudes it has, among other things, an important educative function."</PARA>
<PARA>It says to the community that this behaviour will not be tolerated and can attract criminal sanctions. It does not mean that, if you commit this offence, you are automatically going to be put in prison&mdash;it is not one of those pieces of legislation&mdash;but it does allow for a gaol penalty. It is a matter that, under the Commonwealth Crimes Act, a sentencing judge can take into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But from the coalition we hear, `We don't like your legislation. We're going to introduce alternative legislation.' How is it going to do that? It is going to rely on both the external affairs power and our signature on a number of covenants. It is the only way that it can do it in terms of bringing in national legislation. It needs to use the external affairs power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What else do they say? The member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) said, `The coalition is committed to the introduction of a $10 million educational package to assist in combating racism.' That is just conscience money. The best education system is to enact legislation not reducing the standard of proof or the burden of proof or the criminal onus but saying that this sort of behaviour should attract a criminal sanction. We do it all the time. Oodles of legislation attracts criminal penalties. It does not mean that they are automatically imposed, but it says to the community, `This sort of behaviour is not on any more.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 59 of the proposed act says that a person must not threaten to destroy or damage property other than property belonging to the person. That certainly is already an offence and attracts a period of imprisonment of only one year under the proposed legislation. It then goes on to add another element, `because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of any other person or any group of persons'. Again, that is an essential element of that particular crime: there needs to be sufficient evidence and it needs to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should not walk away from this. There was an excellent article by Ron Castan in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 15 November 1994. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is simply not the case that existing laws always adequately cover racist acts that clearly amount to threats of violence, harassment or incitement, especially in those states still without racial vilification laws.</PARA>
<PARA>So I make no excuse for supporting legislation that carries with it criminal sanctions. It will be a matter for the sentencing judge or magistrate to exercise his discretion, given the nature of the matter with which he is dealing. We are not in my view diminishing the criminal standard to that extent. The opposition needs to reassess its situation. It is a pity that this bill is not going through with bipartisan support. That is the best education campaign. That is the best way to stop racial vilification and to maintain racial harmony in this country. </PARA>

Back in the 1830s, there was the Myall Creek massacre. It was a terrible event, where white men were hanged for the murder of Aborigines. The Chinese had a rotten deal on the goldfields, but that did not stop Thomas Bakhap from becoming a senator in one of the early federation parliaments&mdash;and a senator, I might add, for the Nationalist Party, one of the forerunners of the party I represent. </PARA>

He picked himself up as if nothing had happened and went right on with the mass, which strikes me as a very Australian attitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that in this great country of ours people from the four corners of the earth have been able to come and make a life for themselves. The differences between us are always dissolving into something called `Australianness', which is always in the process of being created and recreated. We do not have `your Australia' and `my Australia'; we simply have `our Australia'. I have one paternal grandfather from England and a maternal grandfather from Holland, yet I do not believe I should say that I am a Dutch Australian or an Anglo-Australian, simply an Australian. I do not normally agree with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), but one instance where the Prime Minister is right is in his dislike of hyphens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very proud to be standing here today and defending the record of my country, our country. I am also pleased to be defending the record of the Liberal Party, my party. The Liberal Party was the first party to put into the federal parliament an Aboriginal, ex-Senator Neville Bonner. The Liberal Party was the first party to put into an Australian parliament&mdash;the New South Wales parliament&mdash;a Chinese born person, Helen Sham-Ho. The Liberal Party ended White Australia at a time when the Labor Party was led by Arthur Calwell, who said, as we remember, `Two wongs don't make a white.' It was the Liberal Party that began large-scale Asian immigration to this country with the Vietnamese boat people at a time when the Labor Party was led by Gough Whitlam, who described those self-same boat people as `effing yellow Balts'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party has a proud record of opposition to racism in all its forms, just as Australia has a proud record of opposition to racism in all its forms. The basic problem with this legislation is that no-one can really demonstrate any clear demand for it. There is nothing which should be illegal which is not currently illegal. Assaults motivated by racism are currently illegal. Graffiti motivated by racism is currently illegal. Arson motivated by racism is currently illegal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most outrageous and reprehensible example of racism in our country is the one perpetrated by Jack Van Tonga in Western Australia. He is serving a very long gaol sentence, as he should be. If we look at the New South Wales legislation&mdash;legislation which is unobjectionable&mdash;we see that there have been something like 400 complaints in the last five years. In that time there have only been three attempts to bring a prosecution under that legislation. So either the legislation does not make a huge difference or there is not a huge problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> So many reputable people in our society believe that this legislation is unnecessary. The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody thinks it is unnecessary. The Australian Law Reform Commission thinks it is unnecessary. Joe Wakim, a prominent member of the Arabic community, said that it was unnecessary. Phillip Adams, a great small `L' liberal and supporter of the Labor Party over the years, believes that it is unnecessary. He said, `Wrong country, wrong time, wrong law.' Even ex-Senator John Button has said that it is unnecessary. The member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) says that it is unnecessary. The Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Johns) says that it is unnecessary. The member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) says that it is unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority is not always right. Certainly in this instance very possibly all those people are wrong, because we in the coalition have seen that the law can be a moral teacher. Sometimes we do need laws to take a moral position, and just possibly this is one of those incidents. But, whatever the position on the principle of racial vilification, the fact is that this is a deeply and fundamentally flawed bill for four reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first reason is that, unlike the New South Wales legislation, which says that to be a criminal offence the incitement must be to an act of violence against persons or property, this law makes mere incitement a criminal offence. There does not need to be any incitement to violence against persons or property. In other words, as Phillip Adams has said, this law turns mere words into a criminal offence punishable by one year's imprisonment. You can go to gaol for mere words. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason this bill is gravely inadequate is that, unlike the New South Wales legislation where a civil offence is created only if a person incites hatred&mdash;and that is very strong&mdash;under this bill all that is necessary to create a civil offence is for someone to feel offended, insulted or humiliated. In other words, all that is necessary to create a civil offence under this bill is for someone to  have hurt feelings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this parliament just last week the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) admitted that, if someone stood up and called the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) a septic tank, that could very possibly cause a civil action and a judgment could be entered against that person. That is not to say that people should run around calling American persons or people of American origin in this country septic tanks, but it is to say that the best argument against bad taste is not to make it illegal. What we need to combat racism is argument, not censorship; we need exposure, not suppression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third argument against the bill as currently drafted is that it creates an offence of vicarious liability. The employer of someone guilty under this bill of inciting racial hatred can be liable just because the person who has actually done the deed did it in the course of his or her employment. In other words, when Ron Casey attacked Chinese restaurants on 2KY a few years back, Michael Easson and Graham Richardson, as directors of 2KY, would have been liable for the same offence of racial vilification. Frankly, that is just not fair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth reason this bill is grossly inadequate is that racism does not have to be the dominant motivation. It simply has to be a substantial motivation. As we know, what constitutes a substantial motivation is entirely in the eye of the beholder. If, for argument's sake, a World War II veteran protesting against a Japanese development somewhere in our country should make the throw-away line, `Well, you know, the Japs were just as bad during the war and they haven't got any better in all these years,' that relatively harmless throw-away line could result in a civil action for racial vilification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, under this bill we have the prospect of people facing heavy fines or even going to gaol simply for making stupid statements. A person could be fined many thousands of dollars by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission&mdash;a non-court&mdash;for something that someone else has done but did not really mean. What has this country come to if people can be fined on so flimsy a basis?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real problem with this legislation is the government's double standards. It had 11 public meetings around the country to gauge the real need for this legislation. It has been reported in the press that at only one of those public meetings was there genuine agreement that the legislation was necessary. Then there are the Prime Minister's double standards. Quite frankly, if the Prime Minister had said of other nationalities what he said about the British, he would very well have been hauled before some of the various tribunals in this country. There is then the difficulty of making martyrs of these people. None of us had heard of David Irving until this government denied him a visa. All of a sudden, he became a martyr to free speech. Let us not make racists martyrs to free speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth reason that this bill is inadequate is that it is more likely to hit the people whom it is supposed to protect. For instance, in the state of New South Wales, some ethnic communities have used the New South Wales vilification legislation as a weapon against other ethnic communities. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of last week reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Father Frank Brennan's fear that federal racial hatred laws might be used as a weapon to inflame inter-ethnic rivalries is well founded. Several complaints have been lodged with the NSW Anti-Discrimination Board alleging vilification of Greeks by Macedonians. One involved an article in a newspaper which they say accused the Greek community of terrorist acts. Another was a petition to Parliament said to accuse Greeks of killing and robbing Jews and migrating on the spoils to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Macedonian community has lodged its own complaints against Greeks as a "defensive measure", says spokesman Victor Bivell. "People became quite annoyed at the complaints lodged against them and (decided) those lodging the complaints were more worthy of being the defendant than them."</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, racial vilification legislation can actually make things worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in Australia are insulting our migrant people by saying that they are not capable of tolerating the same robust standards of debate as the rest of us can tolerate. That is what this bill says. This bill says that we have to put our migrant communities in glasshouses, in humidicribs. We cannot touch them because they are not capable of acting in the same way that ordinary Australians act. That is a slander on our migrants and it is something that this government should be ashamed of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me conclude by quoting from ex-Senator Peter Walsh, who said:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also represent probably the only electorate in Australia that has ethnic minority groups as the majority.

I have had my back patted by people in all the parts of my electorate that I have visited since I have taken a stand on this issue. The last thing that people from ethnic minority backgrounds want is for people to become more conscious of racial differences. Every time you pass a law in this place that makes people out there more conscious of racial differences, you drive this country backwards. That has been done most successfully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), who is sitting in the chamber, would agree with me that things are not as pleasant now as they were when we were young fellows&mdash;and he may still be a young man. I recently spoke with two senior people in Mount Isa. One of them is a very good friend of mine. In fact, we were in business together at one stage. Ron Page, who is the head of Aboriginal affairs in the state government at Mount Isa, and Mona Phillips, were both saying that things are worse now for people of Aboriginal descent than they were 15 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said, `Hold on; you have decent jobs.' They said, `No, there are more important things than that.' There is a big difference between creating jobs for people of Aboriginal descent and having a job as a foreman on the main roads, as Ron Page did. I recently left early to go to the funeral of Charlie Ah Wing, who was one of the pallbearers at my father's funeral. My father had great admiration for Charlie Ah Wing. He got national publicity at odd times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Charlie was a descendant of one of the first Chinamen to come to Australia. They went out to find gold, like my family and so many other families did. They found no gold and were trapped in the middle of nowhere. They were not the sort of people that sat around feeling sorry for themselves. They dug in the riverbed, they found water, they set up winches that used horses to utilise a primitive but very effective form of irrigation and they set up market gardens throughout northern Australia. The Chinese in Far North Queensland built Seven Mile Canal, near Cooktown, which carried water at a very high level and meant they could deliver water through hoses at great pressure and mine for gold. They built that canal by hand, and there were not that many of them. These people were truly remarkable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Charlie Ah Wing's mother was of Aboriginal descent and his father was a Chinese market gardener who also helped on the stations in the Camooweal area. Charlie went to work at Mount Isa Mines. When I worked at Mount Isa Mines Charlie Ah Wing was my foreman. I regret to say that there are not a lot of foremen in the main roads department like Ron Page or at Mount Isa Mines like Charlie Ah Wing. Unfortunately, the laws that have been passed that emphasise the differences between races have had very great subtle and tragic effects out there. Those great achievers were moving up through the ranks and doing wonderful things. That is not the direction in which their children are travelling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Charlie Ah Wing left Mount Isa Mines he set up his own mining operation. If a company attempted to do what he did it would probably have to look at raising about $11 million on the stock market. He sunk all of his superannuation into the operation. Like so many copper gougers&mdash;and I was a copper gouger just before Charlie Ah Wing&mdash;he did not end up making his fortune. But, undoubtedly, at some future date a mining company will make a packet out of the ore body that he opened up. In his latter years, he set up an alcohol rehabilitation centre in Mount Isa. That was one of the few such projects in Australia that was successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Charlie was a superachiever. He is not with us now but there is not the slightest fraction of a doubt in my mind about what his verdict on this legislation would have been. Maybe he was a superachiever and expected other people to be superachievers. He believed that when we give people the image of themselves as losers who need special assistance and special protection we break the thing in those people that makes them capable of achieving great things, as he did in his lifetime. His lifetime was a flashing neon light and advertisement for that point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my homeland I saw with very great pride what was achieved not only by people like Charlie Ah Wing but also by people in the community who were courageous enough to act against the brutality that existed.

He adopted a very courageous attitude in defending and protecting the people of Aboriginal descent in the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing my father did when we bought the picture theatre in Cloncurry was to take out the steel rails which separated the black area of the picture theatre from the white area. That was in the early 1960s, and was regarded as a very courageous move. It was noted in all of the valedictories to my father in the western areas of our electorate. People like Dr David Harvey Sutton also took courageous stands against some of the excesses of some of the people in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to emphasise differences and create laws that emphasise differences then we must look at them carefully. In North Queensland, and certainly in my electorate, we have a very large population from the former Yugoslavia. I was recently with one of my good friends in Mount Isa who owns a late night takeaway and is a successful businessmen. Alex, who is of Moslem descent, said to me, `What is happening over there is really dreadful.' There are Serbians and Croats in North Queensland, and to start emphasising racial differences and handing them this sort of bludgeoning machinery is very dangerous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To hand this sort of machinery to people from southern Ireland and Northern Ireland who live in Mount Isa, to people on the coast from northern Italy and southern Italy&mdash;it is nowhere near as bad there&mdash;and to people from the Aboriginal communities on the peninsula at places like Edward River where they put the Anglican Church between the Mookens on one side of town and the Tyoris on the other side of town, would create problems. Most unfortunate incidents have occurred at Edward River as a result of the extreme racial differences between the two tribes that live in that community which is now called Poomperau. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will refer to one of my first experiences in Aboriginal affairs. We never knew about `Aboriginal affairs' because that was not part of our lexicon in the west. We were brought up to mix with whoever was at the school and we played football with whoever was there to play. We were not conscious of the differences. I was asked to go to a conference that was held in Charter Towers because I was the local state member of parliament. The brilliant Catholic priest there, Father Lancini, absolutely insisted that I attend this conference. I was very angry when they started an `All Blacks' football team in Cloncurry. I say with some degree of pride that I played A-grade football in Brisbane. I played for the black team; because I was considered to be white that beggared up the all black idea. They could not look a gift-horse in the mouth and knock back an A-grade footballer. In Cloncurry's history of four teams we never fielded an all white team and never fielded an all black team. That was a statement in itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I went along to this conference and said what I believed. I had a young lady from Redfern spit at me and tell me that I represented everything that she detested. Four Catholic nuns and one priest came up and actually cried. They said, `We are so ashamed to be of the same faith as you.' I was feeling very embarrassed and self-conscious at this stage. After these people had finished crying and weeping, Clarrie Grogan, a very prominent person in black affairs and a man of Aboriginal descent, came up to me and said, `What are you doing, mate? Can we go for a beer.' I went with him and he brought about 10 of his mates. We sat talking about old times for the next two or three hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed that all these bleeding hearts were sitting by themselves. They had nothing to talk to these black people about. They had no common ground. They had no real interests. They sat by themselves in a corner.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember vividly the advice offered to me by Eric Law, who was the brilliant deputy head of the department of Aboriginal affairs when I was minister in Queensland.

He said, `No, they love me, but they love me on my knees because if ever I stand upright I do not need them.' I completed the sentence&mdash;I said, `They won't have a job.' He said, `No, you do not understand. If you say that they won't have a job, you don't understand. It is far deeper than that. They'd lose their identity. Their identity comes from the fact that they are looking after the poor. That is how they see themselves in life. If you take the poor away from them and make the poor rich and have them standing on their own feet, you destroy their very identity. So it reaches far more deeply than you think.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude that aspect of the matter. We set up self-management in Queensland. All of what were the Aboriginal reserves became self-governing local government communities, with powers that I suppose were far more extensive than those of local government. It was called self-management, and it is one of the things for which I still enjoy accolades today, and so does Eric Law&mdash;one of the architects of that particular happening in Queensland.

The federal government has sent in a development officer. The development officer has slowly undermined your position, and he is continuing to undermine your position.'

Self-management: quick, quick, quick, where is the white bloke to come in and run everything for us?'

Racial vilification laws are aimed at suppressing outward manifestations of racism, but unfortunately they have proven to be a bandaid solution, covering but not curing. It has been suggested that these laws are an easy way to fight racism but, like most easy solutions, it will be an ineffective way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These laws will not eliminate racism but may possibly suppress its expression. Racism will still exist, but it will be silent. David Allen from the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties said:</PARA>

<PARA>Perhaps those less committed to combating racism and more interested in a populist, quick-fix solution will find this cosmetic legislation attractive&mdash;out of sight, out of mind.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While racists are free to express their ideas, they can be identified and challenged. They can be shown to others for the irrationality they represent. Surely, as members of this place, we would acknowledge that laws are completely ineffective in changing the way people think. Racial vilification legislation, such as the bill we are debating, will do no more than hinder long-term solutions to people's racism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ALP is absolutely hypocritical on this issue. We should remember that only a few short years ago racist views now considered outrageous were actively supported by the ALP and other organisations. The ALP was a strident supporter of the White Australia policy, and many trade unions dabbled with anti-Semitism. Last century the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> openly argued that a Jewish bankers' conspiracy existed. It is clear today that these arguments have been consigned, as they should be, to the dustbins of history, and great progress has been made. The racial vilification legislation is a legislative attempt to further their demise. It will not do this; rather it will give racists a mainstream platform and will make them martyrs in the eyes of many. When a vilifying comment is made, it will be reported widely because of the potential legal consequences. When someone is charged, that will be reported. When someone is convicted, that will be reported. Racists will gain more coverage then they could ever hope for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Freedom of speech is a profoundly important policy in this nation and arguably a vital ingredient in our democracy. Our freedom of speech enables us to promote change. The reason racist views are today on the outer is not through a stirring of consciousness, as promoted by legislation such as the Racial Hatred Bill, but because individuals have made a convincing argument for change through the forum of free speech. Freedom of speech is essential even when we do not like the message. The following quotation has been attributed to Voltaire:</PARA>

<PARA>The introduction of racial vilification legislation by this government is a lazy option. By attempting to silence our opponents, we question our own commitment to the cause and acknowledge the strength of our opponent's position. Instead of having faith in our own ideas and our ability to express them, what we are doing is enlisting the state to determine what is right and wrong&mdash;not just to reflect but to shape our moral values. We need to have faith in the strength of our arguments and a personal commitment to further them. There can be no effective substitute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should all be concerned with a state which seeks to regulate opinions and which declares the truth and then seeks to suppress any deviation.

Again, as I said earlier, it turns people into martyrs. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the greatest flashpoint for racism in our society at present is conflict among various ethnic groups. Australians have shown a great deal of understanding at a time when our society has been dramatically changed by high immigration levels. The only real condition popularly desired by Australians has been that the conflicts of the old world should be left behind, understandably remembered but not rekindled. Racial vilification legislation presents itself as yet another flashpoint to rekindle such conflict. These laws could well be used by one group against another as another weapon in an ongoing conflict. The greatest concern is that it will be the larger, better resourced and more politically powerful groups that are the victors in any legal dispute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the historic antipathy in the Balkans and in many other parts of the world, including Greece, Cyprus, Turkey, the Indian subcontinent, Africa and Tibet, there is incredible capacity for great social discord in this nation. Interestingly enough, a good half of the ethnic communities is totally opposed to the government's Racial Hatred Bill. They do not see that this sort of legislation is necessary in a free and democratic society. We ought to recall that many people from these ethnic communities left their homelands to come to this nation so that they could have the freedom of speech and tolerance that we have always displayed in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that the coalition is on very sound ground in opposing the Racial Hatred Bill. We have found that some people who normally have not been public supporters of ours are coming out and saying that the Racial Hatred Bill is a gross invasion of the right of free speech. I cite an example of a well-known Jesuit, Father Frank Brennan, who suggested that the Mabo debate in this country could not have taken place if the Racial Hatred Bill were law. The civil liberties lawyer in Queensland, Terry O'Gorman, is opposed to it, as is Phillip Adams. Ian Macphee, a former Liberal member of this place, has said that he remains to be convinced that racial vilification legislation is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There is a very real danger that our legal system, adversarial as it is, will be called upon to judge who is right and who is wrong with regard to a matter that should be completely alien to our society. The message sent by any decision will not be that of the judge but the message of the victor, seemingly endorsed by the law. Surely our laws should promote harmony among Australia's ethnic groups rather than institutionalising conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The law in Australia already outlaws most matters covered by this bill. We must therefore examine whether it is appropriate in Australia in 1994 to outlaw offence. Any perusal of the law will show that most serious manifestations of racism&mdash;I cite the examples of damaging shrines, threatening language, indecent language, incitement to violence, et cetera&mdash;are already against the law. These laws protect the physical wellbeing of the person and property as well as reputation. Racial vilification laws aim to protect people from being offended by racism. The question is: does the harm of offence, and nothing more, justify the curtailment of other rights and is it fair?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that many people are seriously affected by being offended. Many people in our society take offence easily, and many are susceptible to suffer from it. However, people take offence at a variety of things, racism being only one. Is it right that somehow offence caused by racism is worse than other offensive behaviour? Are we justified in treating such offence as being more serious than derogatory beliefs concerning women, a person's physical attributes, someone's mental capacity or secular beliefs? Should merely insulting someone be actionable? I certainly say no. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition believes that it is very important to have an active and adequate education program to make sure that racism in Australia is shown up for what it is. I was very pleased to hear that $10 million will be spent over two years on an education program. We believe in education rather than compulsion. Over the last 20 or 30 years, Australia has become a very tolerant society and, in this respect, we are the envy of countries throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With education, programs can be devised which have a real effect in eliminating racism. I cite community announcements, school packages and workplace information as some areas which could be looked at. This bill is absolutely deficient. It is more about politics than policy. The government very cleverly thought that it could divide the opposition on this bill. I have a message for the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch): the coalition is 100 per cent opposed to the Racial Hatred Bill. The Attorney-General has totally failed in his attempts to divide us on this issue. The government stands condemned because it has sought to create confrontation among different sections of Australian society. On our side, we have widely consulted with ethnic communities, and half the ethnic community is opposed to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the government is seeking to use the external affairs power, yet again, to legislate in areas that have traditionally been the responsibility of the states. It is appalling that people in Australia, if this legislation is passed and becomes law, will be able to be gaoled for what they say, as opposed to what they do. The thought police are to be set loose. This government will be setting up a type of offence which will see political prisoners created in Australia. I think that is absolutely disgusting and it should be rejected by any reasonable person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the Liberal Party and the National Party are totally opposed to racism in all forms. Our colleagues in earlier speeches have indicated our excellent record in this area during the time this country has been a nation. This is bad legislation. It is not needed. The legislation is reminiscent of what we would normally expect in totalitarian regimes. The infringement of a very basic right&mdash;the right to free speech in a democracy&mdash;in one of the most tolerant countries in the world is something we cannot accept, is something we oppose and is something we condemn the government for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am hopeful that, if the government looks at the enormous range of opinion throughout Australia against what it is doing, sooner or later it will get the message. This legislation is unnecessary. It is opposed by the coalition and many ethnic communities. It is not supported by civil libertarians or fair-minded Australians opposed to racism.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The propaganda accompanying the introduction of the Racial Hatred Bill would have us believe that this is an act designed to eliminate the practice of racial hatred and the practice of inciting people to racial hatred. According to the script, those who oppose or are critical of the Racial Hatred Bill either lack a commitment to multicultural Australia or fail to acknowledge that this is a bill essentially directed at racism on the extremities. The latter argument has prompted critics to argue why, if, as the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) claims, the legislation is hardly likely to effect the status quo, the government has actually bothered to draft such legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those in the ALP who argue that opposition to the bill is opposition to multiculturalism might be surprised to know that groups such as the Australian Arabic Council have expressed their unequivocal opposition to the legislation. Unlike those who oppose the bill on the grounds that it stifles free speech, the Australian Arabic Council focuses on the complex relationship between racism, everyday life and those institutions and people who fashion dominant ideas. Free speech, of course, no matter what civil liberties groups and the High Court say, is a fantasy in an Australia where the production of ideas is in the hands of a privileged few. All the High Court did in the political advertising case was enshrine the rights of the economically powerful to bludgeon the rest with their particular perspective on politics. It did nothing to increase the power of those less economically powerful to engage in the kind of debate that would truly amount to free speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) says about superhighways and CD-ROM suggests that he understands the role economic, social and political factors play in fashioning free speech and culture. It is not about how many pay TV stations are available to the consumer; it is about who owns and controls what those stations produce which determines whether free speech exists and culture flourishes. Some members on this side of the House or the opposition side really need to think about exactly what they mean by free speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Arabic Council argues that the dependence of its community on federal government resources has had the effect of making its criticism of the legislation far more circumspect. Notwithstanding this political consideration, members of the Australian Arabic Council have expressed their disappointment at the lack of opportunity made available to them to engage in a debate about what racial hatred means and how it should be countered. The Australian Arabic Council had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Council welcomes measures aimed at reducing the incidence of racism in Australia, so long as they address the causes (ignorance) and not just the symptoms. Hence we have always advocated for multi-pronged and hard-hitting educational strategies which can affect socio-cultural change in attitudes and behaviours. Legislation should be introduced as a reinforcement measure of these, and not the other way around. With the limited resources available, we believe they are better invested in education than on litigation and lawyers' fees.</PARA>
<PARA>So why did the government not heed the wishes of the Australian Arabic Council and look seriously at the context in which racism occurs and the means by which racist myths might be challenged? Does the government have a political aversion to engaging in a serious critique of the way racism is used to defend the economically powerful against the less powerful? Why have the government and members of this House not had more to say about the manner in which some of our most treasured institutions, including our monopolistic overseas controlled media, have manipulated racist stereotyping in the interests of sensationalism and market advantage?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Was it more palatable for the government to run the line that it is neo-Nazi skinheads with swastikas on their heads, rather than the respectable, who engage in the practice of racial vilification?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, as Conrad Black indicated in his skirmish with the government in what should have been a salutary message to members of this House, media barons are much more powerful than elected politicians. So who is going to control Conrad Black and Rupert Murdoch? Not this legislation, it seems.

<PARA>Being a conservative, it did not serve Robert Manne's purposes to point the finger at the real source of the problem&mdash;the unequal distribution of power and influence within our class based society. Roland Jabbour, Chair of the Australian Arabic Council, in a letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on 2 June 1994 took Robert Manne's proposition a step closer to the core of the matter when he said:</PARA>

<PARA>I wonder if anyone at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> thought of asking Roland Jabbour to write a column in its opinion analysis page. The Australian Arabic Council continued with the argument that unequal access to free speech and influence was the real problem when it noted that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a handful of well-resourced individuals have dominated the ethnic platform and it is these same resourceful groups who have benefited from widespread access to the media and are the very groups who will benefit from legislation for exactly the same reason.</PARA>
<PARA>Criticism of the government's approach from the Australian Arabic Council should force those on the Labor side who have chosen to score a political point at the expense of an equivocating coalition to reassess their position and acknowledge the deficiencies of a fundamentally legalistic approach to combating racism. Notwithstanding the Australian Arabic Council's arguments, it is an unfortunate fact that the coalition is gripped by political ineptitude and does not have the will to jettison those antiquated ideas which at present make the party so unpalatable to the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than expose the philosophical shortcomings of the legislation and the bill's inability to confront the real and varied sources and uses of racism, the coalition, with a couple of exceptions, chose to hide behind the banner of free speech and focus on the alleged mechanical deficiencies and complexities of the bill. So, when it has the opportunity of looking and sounding progressive, the coalition decides to plant the stamp of reactionary politics on its forehead. Instead of arguing for a stronger and more courageous approach to combating racism, the coalition chooses to do nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone knows that the Racial Hatred Bill is as much about marginalising the coalition as it is about combating racism. So why did the coalition not grasp the nettle and garner the support of those ethnic groups who were dissatisfied with and cynical about the legislation?

The following is taken from a magazine, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">People and Place</EMPHASIS>, published by the Monash University Australian Forum of Population Studies:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Arabs like to concentrate, marry within their own group, they have a religion which is very different from the religions of other Australians. It is not the type of religion that encourages inter marriage.</PARA>
<PARA>Can you believe that? It makes you wonder how the bloke actually became a professor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the majority of our first and probably second and third generation migrants throughout our 200 years of white history have tended to marry within their own cultural and religious grouping is lost on this bloke. So too is the fact that a high proportion of migrants from the Middle East, in particular in the Lebanese community, are Christian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the claim that Arabs have a religion that does not encourage intermarriage, has our professor ever studied the rules and customs of Catholicism? The old Pope is not exactly a libertine on the issues of Catholic morality; and it was not so long ago that a Catholic marrying a Protestant was virtually not only ex-communicated but ruled out of the family will. Professor Price's stereotyping is the kind that produces a fertile ground for racial vilification&mdash;but it will be exempt. </PARA>

So much for your free speech&mdash;maybe it is education. You might even argue that a decent newspaper should not run them. Professor Price's pearls pale into insignificance when Arnie Schwarzenegger wacks the liniment on, grabs the Armalite in the claw and takes on the rich, ugly terrorist Arab in the film <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">True Lies</EMPHASIS>.

<PARA>The Australian Arabic Council had this to say about the film in the context of the Racial Hatred Bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's Federal government needs to consider this movie in light of the Racial Hatred Bill. There is no denying that such movies through the popular media reinforce racist stereotypes, both on overt and subliminal levels. The real consequences on vilified groups in terms of employment discrimination, religious persecution, and hate crimes has been well documented in Australia and elsewhere and should not be underestimated.</PARA>
<PARA>The problem is, as we in this House all know, 20th Century Fox is&mdash;and the baby of the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Hollywood on the Harbour, will be&mdash;a bit more powerful than the average punter. If organisations of this kind choose to construct images or produce subliminal messages which denigrate or vilify on the basis of race, there is nothing anyone can do. That is what is wrong with this legislation. Arnie Schwarzenegger's film and CNN will not qualify, no matter how many Muslims are abused, as acts inciting racial hatred. Racist, imperialistic and subservient to vested interests these works of art might be; but designed to incite racial hatred they are not, so the legal argument would run. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the explanatory memorandum it is said that the bill closes a gap in the legal protection available to the victims of extreme racist behaviour. Unfortunately, the memorandum seems to assume the extreme racist behaviour is only found in the jackboot and that the propaganda produced, for example, by Goebbels in the 1930s to accompany the jackboot was of secondary significance. Retrospectively, we know what the connection between the propaganda and the incitement to racial hatred and racial violence was in Germany in the 1930s. But who saw the connection at the time? Certainly not Bob Menzies or the royal family. Robert Manne says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the rise of popular anti-Semitism under the Nazis the artistry of the film Jew Suss played a not insignificant role.</PARA>
<PARA>Goebbels, of course, would have told us that his was a work of art or a scientific study done in good faith&mdash;a bit like Professor Price from Monash University, I suppose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the lack of and tardiness of official objection to the racial discrimination and subliminal racial hatred contained in the media's handling of the Gulf war, one could comfortably arrive at the conclusion that drawing a connection between an act of racial violence and the source of racial hatred is not easily established. The member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) touched on this problem in his speech last night when he listed a series of incidents and attacks on Melbourne's Arabic community during the Gulf war. What the honourable member for Melbourne did not acknowledge was that the very person who supplied this information, Joe Wakim, has expressed his opposition to the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With all due respect to the member for Melbourne, I think he should have at least examined the Australian Arabic Council's opposition to the legislation. Among other things, Mr Wakim argues that the issue has been approached the wrong way around by looking at legislative responses before fully debating or understanding the causes of racism. The problem with this bill is that it says nothing about the real causes of racism and fails to acknowledge the role economic and social inequality plays in denying particular ethnic groups the capacity to counter racial humiliation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) towards the end of his speech last night quoted a line `There is no greater injustice than treating unequals equally' from the American jurist Mr Justice Frankfurter in defence of the legislation. I would argue, in fact, that the bill makes the mistake of treating unequals equally. I am sure that the member for Melbourne Ports, a lawyer himself, would agree that social class and influence are important factors in determining one's access to the law&mdash;and the name John Elliott springs to mind immediately. This is exactly what Joe Wakim and the Australian Arabic Council meant when they said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most advocates for the law were prominent members of well established ethnic communities such as the Italian, Chinese and Jewish communities who had the literacy and education to take advantage of the law.</PARA>
<PARA>Class questions are important. I would have thought people on the Labor side would understand that. The claim that everyone is equal before the law or that this legislation enshrines free speech is pure fantasy. The bill enshrines free speech by the powerful, in what the American philosopher Herbert Marcuse would have described as an act of repressive tolerance. What it does not outlaw, rather than what it does, is the real problem. Because of exemption 18D, it turns a blind eye to those with the greatest capacity to marginalise people according to their ethnic or political persuasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is instructive that throughout the debate very few members have drawn on the experiences of people during the Gulf War. Robert Manne talks of the rise of a peculiar mood of progressivist intolerance, as if the radicals are stealing the march on conservatives and instituting their own brand of political correctness. Manne likes it both ways. Political correctness, as Robert Manne knows but never admits, has always been the preside of the economically and socially powerful. After all, it was Robert Menzies, not the ALP, and conservative forces in America, not radicals, that attempted to institute political correctness in the 1950s. The truth is there is nothing particularly radical about the bill. Robert Manne should not worry. He and his conservative mates, whether in academia or the media, are pretty safe. It is the ordinary punter who has something to worry about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be fairly brief in speaking to the Racial Hatred Bill. It has been covered by members on both sides and has been covered virtually clause by clause. I rise today because I think I am the only person on this side of the House who is of non-Anglo-Saxon birth. I was born in Hungary, in eastern Europe. My parents came to this country as refugees after the Second World War in 1949. I grew up as a migrant in the 1950s and 1960s in the Hawkesbury district of New South Wales, which is now part of the western suburbs. It was a tough life. It was very different.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) raised an interesting point. He said that ethnic communities oppose this bill because it draws attention to the differences when they are trying desperately to assimilate into this community. That struck a chord with me. We were migrant children. We were out in the bush. We did not have contact with anybody. When we turned up to school on the first day we could not speak the language, but within a week we could. It was very important to us to minimise the differences. The fact was that we were different. We spoke a different language. We dressed differently. We held different beliefs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But one thing that I learnt from my parents was the value of freedom. My parents were raised in a country in which they were no strangers to oppression, no strangers to censorship, and freedom of speech was not enjoyed. It was not a right. Freedom of speech was exercised in whispers, not in a loud voice. That was a background against which I started my early life and we started to learn to become Australians. I could see my father learning to become an Australian. I do not think he ever went a day without working. My father held two jobs for many years while he educated his family and gave us a very good start in a magnificent country. The family got used to this freedom. It does not happen overnight. It takes time to realise that this is something new. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember when I was living in Canberra&mdash;I was at the Australian National University studying political science&mdash;my father came down from Sydney and came to my home. He was absolutely shocked that I had on my bookshelf Karl Marx's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Das Kapital </EMPHASIS>and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Communist Manifesto</EMPHASIS>. I was studying international politics&mdash;communism, fascism, democracy&mdash;and there were these textbooks on my shelf. My father, as a young man in eastern Europe, grew up at a time when communism was in its embryonic stages. The reaction was that any documents, any books, were censored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was 24 or 25 years of age and that was the first time my father had ever set eyes on two books which were fundamental to communism, the form of government that existed in the country and the very thing that he fled from. He never read the book. He did not want to read it. This is the sort of background against which I learnt the value of freedoms. I know that it takes time to appreciate these freedoms. The greatest freedom of all is the freedom of speech. That is why I oppose this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleagues have spelt out to the House why the legislation is flawed. But there are adequate provisions in state law that can cover these things. I cannot find one commentator in the media who supports this bill. I will refer to a few commentators. Kavanagh writes for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS>. The honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) would know that Kavanagh is very widely read in Queensland. I do not always agree with him but I value his opinion. Kavanagh says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You cannot legislate against hatred. You can pass laws commanding people to accept something they might find abhorrent in their twisted hearts but you cannot make them practise what you preach. You could try to fight prejudice and bigotry through education but that has been given a good work-out over the years and has not succeeded. Despite centuries of efforts by many dedicated people, we still are killing each other in every corner of the globe, probably at a greater rate than the dark ages thanks to commendable progress and weapons of mass destruction.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So about the only thing the Attorney-General, Michael Lavarch, will achieve with his Racial Hatred Bill will be to win a few bleeding heart votes and maybe stifle a little free speech. Most Australian states already have adequate laws to punish the racial bigots so why the duplication? As a colleague pointed out this week, isn't it amazing that at a time when the former Soviet Union is abolishing its restrictions on free speech this federal government is about to further restrict ours?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the heading `Bad Law', the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and there would certainly be a bigger benefit for the country&mdash;if the federal coalition simply called the Racial Hatred Bill for what it is (a nonsense) and refused to have any truck with it at all. This is a Bill in which the thought police and the behavioural monitors have had altogether too great an influence. It is the first step on a very slippery slide into censorship and thought control.</PARA>
<PARA>I say it is consistent with the practice of this government being the social laboratory producing bad results and unintended results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Wills (Mr Cleary) referred to the leader of the Australian Arabic Council, Mr Joe Wakim. It is interesting that the leader of such an influential community in Australia has publicly opposed the new racial vilification bill, claiming the legislation is divisive and ignores the concerns of the most vulnerable groups. He said that most vocal advocates for the law were prominent members of well-established ethnic communities&mdash;such as Italian, Chinese and Jewish communities&mdash;who have the literacy and education to take advantage of the laws. He was inferring that other communities do not have equal access to this law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we have Phillip Adams, who I do not think is a friend of the coalition. In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, he wrote:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But I'm convinced this is the wrong law at the wrong time in the wrong country. Not only does it take another bite out of the masticated notion of free speech, but I feel it will prove provocative and counter-productive.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A headline in an <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> editorial, as every other editorial that I could find clearly said, reads: `Race hate Bill is unnecessary'.

On both counts, the answer is no.</PARA>
<PARA>I will quote again from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS>, because I am a Queenslander. Its headline reads `A blunt axe&mdash;Freedom is much more valuable'. In concluding its editorial, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> wrote:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the spirit of shortened addresses, I will keep mine somewhat short. However, I would like to touch on a few points in the Racial Hatred Bill, because it is central to where Australia is going. As I have said in the past, I have great objection to the use of the external affairs powers. I recognise that we must have laws of the sea, laws of the air, laws of extradition, laws of immigration and so on. They are sensible. I accept feeling somewhat ambivalent about certain laws regarding national parks, world heritage areas and so on. But I object strongly when external affairs powers start to intrude into the social fabric of Australia. That is where I draw my line in the sand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have three objections to the Racial Hatred Bill 1994. The first is its name. The very title is used to evoke the strongest possible community reaction and gives currency to the impression that there is a pervasive aura of hatred in the Australian community. We all know that is not so. As other speakers have said, this is not a perfect nation, but we are not dripping with hatred from end to end. So one questions why there should be such a bill and why it should have such a repugnant name. The term `racial vilification' is repugnant enough, but the term `racial hatred' is even more so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against this atmosphere we are again presented with a bill that appears to rely on the external affairs powers under section 51 of the constitution&mdash;but more ridiculously so than previous efforts by the government. As previous speakers have outlined in this racial hatred debate, redress is already available in the criminal codes of the states. How ridiculous it is that a citizen charged and successfully prosecuted under the New South Wales Crimes Act could attract a five-year sentence while another, for a crime under the Commonwealth bill, could attract only a one-year sentence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable members are aware, two commissions of inquiry have recommended against this type of legislation. You would think that, if this legislation were going to be promoted, it would be promoted by these two inquiries. The first was the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and the second was the Australian Law Reform Commission into multiculturalism. The fact that `hatred' is such a subjective term leaves extraordinary latitude in interpretation. As such, as one speaker said, it will be a lawyers' field day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To illustrate the point, there are two examples in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS>. Firstly, a 17-year-old boy in the UK was convicted for leaving an anti-black immigration pamphlet at the door of an MP's premises. He was convicted, but on appeal was acquitted because the appeal judge said the distribution of a pamphlet was not an attempt to stir up hatred but an attempt to change an MP's opinion on policy. Secondly, a group of defendants who used in a speech terms such as `wogs', `coons', `niggers' and `black bastards' were arraigned before the courts. It was argued, though we might say capriciously so, that the terms might evoke sympathy for the abused groups, not hatred. Believe it or not, the jury accepted that and the defendants were acquitted. It shows you the sort of nonsense that these hatred bills come up against. They become almost a laughing stock of themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I abhor the conduct of the perpetrators of the acts that were illustrated in these two excerpts from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS>, I wonder whether, at the end of such a board of proceedings, the community heat level had been raised or lowered. I would think that in both instances the level of community heat&mdash;the level of resentment about a racial taunt&mdash;would have been higher. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will expand this to give the basis of my second objection, which flows from the first. There are in the laws of the land adequate remedies for all sorts of radically motivated acts: violence, disruptive behaviour, abuse, defacing property, arson, unlawful assembly and so on. I believe this bill may well excite the very sentiments it seeks to suppress. If you like, the legislative identification of the forms of racial outrage may in themselves become self-fulfilling prophecies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note at that point what Father Frank Brennan said. A few people have referred to Father Brennan in this debate, but I do not think I have heard anyone yet use these two of his quotes. I think they should go on the record because they have something to say. Father Brennan said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact you have a problem in society doesn't mean you make a criminal law against it. The criminal law is a very blunt instrument for reshaping the hearts of racists and clearing the air of racist sentiment.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At this time, in this part of the world, thought police armed with criminal sanctions are not the answer.</PARA>
<PARA>So say all of us on this side of the House. I feel that in this legislation the government denigrates the ethnic community. If you like, it virtually says, `You people cannot look after yourselves. In your integration with the broad mass of Australian people we will have to look after you.' When I mention that to people of ethnic extraction, they take the greatest possible exception to that sort of patronising effect. This is patronising legislation against the broad raft of people of ethnic origin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is a homogeneous society. That homogeneity has not been static. We have evolved from convicts, soldiers, free settlers&mdash;a wide range of various financially resourced and social and religious groups, albeit in the early days of a heavy northern European extraction. At various times we have absorbed immigration influxes: of the free settlers of the 1830s, from the various gold rushes, the postwar settlements and, more recently, the intensive migration of the post-World War II era. These bursts have told us two things: firstly, people come to this nation for its lifestyle, its opportunity, its safety, its institution and the protection of its laws; and, secondly, successive homogenous groups of Australians have continued to develop these laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People came to this country from nations with appalling records of conduct in civil rights, liberty and matters as fundamental as safety in the streets. They came here because of what we had to offer. Ostensibly, they left behind their previous lives, hatreds and unhappinesses. Certainly, that concept has changed the way we now do things. But even in multiculturalism, as Hawaii found in the blending of the various racial groupings, the end product of this era of multiculturalism will be a new homogeneity. There will be a new Australia and a new, distinctively Australian character. It will be a blend of the old that we are familiar with now and the various off-shoots from this multiculturalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If as a result of these hatred laws and their application by one ethnic group against the other&mdash;in other words, taking the very institutions that people came to this country to receive and having cast off the ones of their own countries&mdash;we set one ethnic group against the other, then I believe longstanding divisions will be fostered. There is ample evidence in some of them that these laws may be used. The authors of this legislation&mdash;I speak of the current Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and the government in general&mdash;will bear a heavy responsibility. We may well find that this marvellous, continuing, ongoing homogeneity that we have developed right from our earliest days in this country has stalled and that permanent divisions may be instituted in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This leads me to my third objection: the duplicity of the government. The Attorney-General has said that aspects of this bill may never be exercised but the fact that they are on the statute book will have an educative effect. What a lot of nonsense. I remind the Attorney-General that that is precisely the argument I advanced on the privacy bill. I will repeat what I said then because it is relevant to this bill. I said that I have never been one for kicking down doors or jumping through windows with cameras to catch consenting adult homosexuals in private. It is years since consenting adults in private have been prosecuted in Tasmania. However, the laws, though they had not been exercised, laid down the parameters of acceptability. If the Attorney-General is going to advance that proposition in respect of the Racial Hatred Bill, why would he not accept the same proposition in relation to the privacy laws?</PARA>

I recognise that, from time to time, there will be the odd&mdash;and I would think very odd&mdash;circumstance where people are disadvantaged by coming here from another country. Perhaps the laws that we have at present do not protect those people in the way that we would like. But I believe that establishing a particular bill that looks at this is totally inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to bring people together in this country and develop an interest as Australians for Australians, we should not introduce legislation that enables racial qualifications to be placed in front of them. There should not be the opportunity to develop a case whereby somebody of a particular racial background is taken outside of being an Australian citizen and of being part of our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this bill, in the way that it has been framed, does exactly that. When people claim that they have been disadvantaged for racial reasons, a counterclaim will be made. For every claim and counterclaim that is made in this country, there will be a build-up of dissatisfaction either on the part of those Australian citizens who feel that they have been disadvantaged by the penalties that have been imposed upon them or on the part of the people who have come from an overseas country who, as a result of putting up a claim and its not being recognised, feel that they have been disadvantaged. Every claim and counterclaim will work against what we should be looking at doing in this country, which is trying to unite every person as an Australian citizen behind one set of laws and values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a major concern with what this law is going to do for people in our community. Ultimately, it may disadvantage individual racial groups. As claims come forward&mdash;as inevitably they will under this legislation, if it is passed&mdash;individual racial groups and communities will see themselves being, if you like, ostracised for making particular claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to think that the overwhelming number of people with racial backgrounds who have spoken to me in the community of their concerns about this bill will make sure that they speak to the senators in the other place to ensure they realise that a large number of people in our community are very concerned about this piece of legislation. I expect that, on the basis of numbers, this bill will pass through this chamber. Their only way of blocking this legislation will be to speak to people in the other place who will be able to stop its passage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a little concerned that this debate was brought on in such haste by the government. But I suspect that it was done for purely political purposes. I am also concerned about the time that we are spending on the information contained in this legislation when many other issues in our community are far more fundamental and important to people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you want to look at the rights and opportunities and areas of disadvantage for people who have come from overseas, it is far more important to get the employment problems of this country into order and to give those people a job. That is where they are being disadvantaged. If you want to sort out the problems in this country, it is far more important to make sure they get the opportunity to learn the language and to lift the literacy levels in this country than to pass this piece of legislation. If you want to look after those people in this country, it is far more important for us to talk about making them part of this community and making them part of one set of laws in this country than it is to introduce this piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I expect that, irrespective of how many words are said in this place, this legislation will pass on the numbers. I very much regret that. But I can assure you that I will not sit idly by. I will speak to the people in my community who have major reservations about this and ask them to speak to the people in the other place to ensure that, at least where there is some equilibrium, the representation of those people is actually recognised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I will not detain the House with any sort of lengthy summing up. There has been a long and very thorough debate here. A whole variety of views has been put genuinely, and passionately on occasions. The Racial Hatred Bill invites that sort of scrutiny.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to take up one point which the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) raised and which I have heard repeated in a range of other contributions and seen in some commentary in newspapers. He alleged that there is an inconsistency in our saying that any law can have a statement or educative effect when we did not say the same thing about the laws regarding homosexuality in Tasmania. He questioned whether the government&mdash;and particularly me&mdash;was being inconsistent on that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no inconsistency. I have always recognised&mdash;and, in my view, it is one of the objectionable things about the law in Tasmania&mdash;that it did very well have statement and educative effects. But that statement was wrong and, in my view, the educative effect it was trying to send out was very wrong. If you talk to the people in Tasmania whom that law was directed at and ask what they thought of the educative effect, statement effect and the impact it was having on their lives, they would tell you very clearly that laws do have statement and educative effects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My objection to the Tasmanian law was not that it did not have such an effect, but that the effect it had was wrong. I think that the effect of a law like this would be the right effect, the right statement of education. I will not detain the House further, but thank members from both sides for their contribution. This matter will attract considerable debate in the other house and will probably go through a committee process in which we will hear a little more about it. I hope that the rationed and reasoned debate we have experienced in this chamber can accompany the debate in the other house, as in the broader community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise an important matter with the House. It relates to the Inglewood hostel in my electorate. In July 1991 a formal application for 20 hostel beds was lodged with the Commonwealth Department of Community Services and Health. I organised a deputation from the hostel committee to go to the Commonwealth Department of Health, Housing and Community Services in October 1991. In May 1992 an announcement was made by Senator John Button on behalf of the minister that a grant of $702,833 would be allocated towards the Inglewood 20-bed hostel project. The committee then swung into action with its fundraising, which was extremely successful. We have to remember that this was in a period of extensive drought and very hard times for the rural community of Inglewood.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appeal raised $400,000 from the local community, an outstanding effort. In August 1993 the committee raised another $60,000 to help provide furnishings and equipment for the hostel. On 21 August 1994 the honourable member for Calwell, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous), deputising for the minister, arrived to open the new hostel after construction had been completed. It was decided that the government would give an additional $45,000 to the project because it had reneged on its earlier commitment of $702,833, reducing it to $657,194. The parliamentary secretary announced this and left no-one in Inglewood in any shadow of doubt that the further $45,000 would be made available to the hostel committee. The local people had done their part; they had raised over $460,000. Senator Button had made a promise of $702,833. Then the government reneged. The parliamentary secretary, on behalf of the minister, made a commitment of $45,000 for an extra bed for the financially disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now three months since that promise was made to the people of Inglewood. That commitment has not been honoured. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mr Snowdon), who is at the table, to take note of this because the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health came with the authority of the minister and on her behalf opened this 20-bed hostel, made a commitment&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in the adjournment debate to endorse the action of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) in proclaiming the Hinchinbrook Channel at Oyster Point under the World Heritage Conservation Act. Despite the efforts of the developer to continue bulldozing old growth mangroves, even under floodlights in the early hours of the morning, there still is hope for regeneration because the root systems have not been damaged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision by the minister was made to protect World Heritage values of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The Valentine report commissioned by the federal government identified 15 specific impacts on World Heritage. What is of major concern is the threat to the seagrass beds which are the breeding grounds for turtles and other marine life as well as dugongs. The minister has made it clear that he has taken this action only as a last resort after exhausting all other options to secure a halt on the mangrove clearing which was continuing on the site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next step is further necessary scientific investigation. I have a copy of a letter by up to 50 scientists which was sent to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) supporting the need for further evaluation. The letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We, the undersigned scientists, express our deep concern with the process of evaluation of the Port Hinchinbrook development at Oyster Point. We are concerned about the lack of scientific input and the virtual absence of baseline data for impact evaluation.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hinchinbrook Channel is an important habitat for a suite of wildlife of high conservation status.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the works were allowed to continue, there was a strong possibility that the turbidity created by the site work would impact on the seagrass beds, which are an integral part of the World Heritage values of the Hinchinbrook Channel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hinchinbrook Channel forms part of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage area. I am concerned about jobs and I understand that others are too. I am concerned about those people in my electorate, particularly in Far North Queensland, who are still out of work. But if the integrity of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage area is threatened, as the scientific assessment seems to suggest, then there will be a long-term effect on unemployed people in Far North Queensland and the rest of Queensland.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last week there has been a world conference on ecotourism in Tasmania.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one is saying that there should be no resort at Oyster Point. People are saying that, if there is a resort at Oyster Point, it should be an appropriate development. There is no doubt that there are appropriate developments in Queensland and other parts of Australia. There are developments that are designed to fit in with the natural environment. But the scientific opinion seems to suggest, at least in terms of the impact of this development on the Hinchinbrook Channel, that there certainly is not that sort of cohesion with the natural environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no hesitation in saying&mdash;I will not use the word `congratulations'&mdash;that Senator Faulkner has done the absolute right thing here. He has had no choice on this matter. The advice that he got was that the World Heritage values were threatened and he had to act to protect them. He had to act because he had an obligation to act not only for the people of Far North Queensland and Australia but also for the world because the Great Barrier Reef is a World Heritage area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have all heard many stories of incompetence and arrogance by banks, but I have come across few more disgraceful cases than the experience of my constituent Mr Gerry Powell of Proston. He has been appallingly treated by the Commonwealth Bank. The worst part of this case has been the failure of the banking industry ombudsman to intervene in his support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Powell has been involved in extensive and, in his view, unsatisfactory litigation which resulted in a judgment against him with costs totalling almost $100,000. Mr Powell appealed the judgment and was required to lodge his record book with the court of appeal by 4.00 p.m. on 11 February this year. The case involved allegations of legal malpractice and Mr Powell had difficulty getting a lawyer to act on his behalf. Finally, a Brisbane firm, Stockey and Co., said it would act and lodge the documents provided Mr Powell paid it an amount of $1,000 by 1.30 p.m. on that day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Powell approached his bank, the Commonwealth Bank, in Murgon, which advised that it could make a telegraphic transfer to meet that deadline. He drove for over an hour into Murgon, paid a fee of $23 and was advised by the bank that the money had been transferred. However, the bank made an error. Instead of transferring the money as cleared funds, as it should have, it was sent as unclear. As a result, the Brisbane branch did not transfer the money to Stockey and Co. The documents were not lodged and it was not until 14 February that the mistake was discovered. It was too late by that time to intervene. Despite a request by Mr Powell to defer the matter, the appeal was dismissed because the record book had not been lodged. A judgment of almost $100,000 was awarded against my constituent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I admit that Mr Powell should have lodged the money earlier, but the bank offers a service. It advertises that it provides a service. It charges a fee. The ultimate insult in this case is that the bank actually charged him a second fee to bring the money back as the money was no longer useful because of its error. The Commonwealth Bank has acknowledged that it made the mistake, but it has offered nothing by way of compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 15 February, my constituent complained to the ombudsman firstly by phone call and then in writing. He requested an urgent response as the appeal was to go to court on 25 February. When he had not heard from the ombudsman by 22 February, he contacted my office. I phoned the ombudsman and emphasised the urgency of the case. It was not until 1 March, after the appeal had been heard, that the ombudsman even acknowledged that he had received the case and advised that it would be six weeks before an investigator was able to devote time to the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is really disgraceful. Despite many letters, phone calls and faxes from me, including one letter in which I reminded the ombudsman that justice delayed is justice denied&mdash;and that was particularly true in this instance&mdash;and despite newspaper coverage of the case, it was not until 5 September that the ombudsman finally reported on the case. In an incomprehensible conclusion, the ombudsman said that, in spite of the fact that the bank admitted the error `there appears to be no maladministration by the bank'. I have to say that I was shocked by this finding and the denial of natural justice. I admit that Mr Powell may not have won his case in court but, because of the bank error, he was denied his day in court and denied an opportunity to put his case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By this time, creditors were pressing my constituent for bankruptcy. He appealed the ombudsman's finding and it was not until 25 October that the ombudsman confirmed the original decision. It took the ombudsman eight months to deal with this urgent case. How can the public have any confidence in the processes of the banking ombudsman?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation now is that the Commonwealth Bank continues to trade and charge fees for services not provided. The banking ombudsman continues to claim to independently examine cases brought to his attention. On 3 November my constituent, Mr Powell, was declared bankrupt. Banks and other creditors will now take the last of his possessions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an appalling abuse of the system. The bank has failed to act correctly, but it has not taken any responsibility for its actions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The success of enterprise bargaining depends on one key concept laid down in the act, and that is the concept of bargaining in good faith. Bargaining in good faith is clear enough to anyone who has even a minimum grasp of the English language. To bargain means to give and take on both sides. It means talking and it means negotiation. It means a discussion where precedent and comparison are part of the process. It means negotiation on both sides, between the employers and the employees, with an industrial relations manager or his equivalent representing the company and the representatives of the employees, selected by free choice, all coming together to make their agreement, taking into account the laws of the land and the fact that we have evolved, over generations, a safety net of conditions accepted in the community.

It wants to collectively bind and gag its work force by ensuring that each individually negotiated contract, in terms of the long-term outcomes, is akin to a boxing contest between an Australian heavyweight champion and a first-time bantamweight. In such a context there can never be a fair contest let alone a bargain involving negotiation. There can be no negotiation or bargaining in the circumstances that CRA is seeking to impose upon its work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Success in Australian business happens for those who have invested in their work force, reorganised themselves and recast their relationships with their staff. Those who have put the boxing matches behind them and talked and worked cooperatively with their work forces are achieving success, particularly in exports. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 10 November, Peter Roberts said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last week <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Leading the Way</EMPHASIS>, a study of best manufacturing practices released by the Australian Manufacturing Council, shows clearly that companies adopting best practice are outperforming those that are not.</PARA>
<PARA>Page 28 of that study states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An enterprise agreement is unlikely to be successful if the ingredients for co-operation&mdash;open and honest communication and trust&mdash;are not there.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, those ingredients are not there for CRA. Mr Roberts went on in his article to observe:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The study, of 1,400 companies in Australia and New Zealand, suggests that the main factors in improved business performance are internal to the enterprise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Improving people practices is seen as the key issue for companies boosting competitiveness. Old-style dictatorial management and confrontational industrial relations policies are simply incompatible with focusing enterprises on delivering quality products and services to satisfy customer needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">According to the Australian Manufacturing Council survey, 83 per cent of best practice companies in Australia suggest leadership involves encouraging change and implementing a culture of trust, involvement and commitment.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said earlier, if a culture of trust, involvement and commitment is so necessary to highly productive and successful firms, why is it that such a large and important Australian company like CRA is moving its industrial relations policies in the opposite direction. The answer is CRA's fanatic ideology and desire to rigidly and ruthlessly implement plan X, the details of which I outlined in this House last week. CRA has an ideology that has nothing to do with the process of discussion and bargaining in good faith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bargaining in good faith means that there must be rights and responsibilities on both sides. The take it or leave it contract in plan X, such as that advocated by not only CRA but also those opposite, is usually a scrap of paper which employees are given only days to consider. It says nothing of conditions, it offers only a token carrot of cash and it is subject to unilateral review by the employer at any time. That is not bargaining in good faith. It is simply the procedure of doling out some extra cash, which is like feeding a goose for a short time before killing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with CRA is that its form of enterprise bargaining and the prospects that it holds for this country will prejudice growth. What CRA is doing is prejudicing the capacity of firms to become more highly productive and to grow. There is no use the Business Council of Australia or the Industry Commission mouthing platitudes about flexibility in industrial relations when we have a company which wants to smash the whole nature of enterprise bargaining&mdash;that is, enterprise negotiation based on good faith, underpinned by the award safety net. CRA, through plan X, has demonstrated that it will use and abuse any offer of good faith and any willingness to negotiate by a sly and vicious manipulation of the work force. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Monday 7th November a supporting parent (a father) rang me at 8.35 a.m. in tears of frustration. He finally had found full time work but living 15 kms out of town was unable to find child care places for his three children 5 1/2, 4 and 2 years. Commencing work in Toowoomba at 6 a.m. means he wanted to place his children in Family Day Care. Even trying the newly opened centres in Toowoomba did not ease his stress since they only had spaces for the pre-schoolers and were not open at 6 a.m. He had by the time he phoned me discovered that we could not help him within Family Day Care either city or regionally. The last additional E.F.T.'s in our Regional Program came at the commencement of 1993 when we received 25 E.F.T.'s ( 1/4 of the estimated need we had submitted for). All of the rural satellite towns are experiencing high growth particularly in terms of first home buyers and young families. Transport is a great problem in these areas and hence travel into Toowoomba may be impossible even if care  in town became available. I knew of nowhere I could send him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tuesday 8th November 9.30 a.m. A young mother phoned me urgently needing four days a week care for her baby now 5 months old.

The young mother has had her son on our waiting list since the day he was born&mdash;in fact she rang me in an attempt to arrange care 5 months before he was born. Baby places in this town are still an issue particularly as the new centres prefer parents to book for 5 days per week.

They are hard pressed after 6 years and 8 years in the industry to see many benefits in providing care through a system that is so heavily regulated but yet does not through periodic growth allow for consideration towards earning capacity of its "coal face" workers. Some of the changes in funding seem to have been made with due regard to centre based care arrangements but with little or no regard to the operation of Family Day Care let alone with regard to the needs of families or carers.

However, the question arises&mdash;if the government expects the current gaps in child care to be filled by private child care centres do they then realise the following:-</PARA>

Other crimes of incitement deal with action; for example, incitement to commit fraud, murder, sedition, et cetera&mdash;all those crimes require a physical act. Hatred does not require a physical act. It is simply in the mind.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to place on record my concerns about the alarming erosion of our nation's valuable breeding stock in the wake of the current drought which has devastated much of the eastern seaboard. Recent reports suggest that up to 70 per cent of the animal stock in Australia could be wiped out, such is the severity of the drought.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Critical to the immediate survival of our breeding stock, in particular our beef herd, is the supply of molasses. For the uninitiated, molasses is a sugar industry by-product that is a vital drought feed supplement used by much of the northern beef industry. Molasses is a form of liquid energy for starving stock. Fed with urea, the medium supplies nitrogen supplementation to this stock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the record 35 million tonne cane crop harvested this year, molasses supplies have already disappeared due to the increasing demand for drought feeding. The situation is especially tight from central Queensland to central western New South Wales. Over the last two months or so, I have tried to bring the looming crisis to the attention of both the Queensland and federal governments. In return, I have been described as a panic merchant and have basically been told that molasses is a commercial reality, and not one for government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give the House a few facts on molasses. Queensland produces 95 per cent of the nation's sugar and approximately the same proportion of molasses&mdash;about a million tonnes. North Queensland, from Mackay north, produces 85 per cent of the Queensland sugar crop and hence 85 per cent of the molasses. This year Queensland will have exported approximately 430,000 tonnes of molasses, or approximately half of our production. The rest is used domestically, either contracted for by regular molasses consumers such as feedlotters, dairy farmers, feedstock manufacturers or, as has been the case over this drought period, purchased by spot sale. The 1994 sugar crushing season has now virtually come to an end. No more molasses will be produced until June next year. The Northern Hemisphere production does not commence until early December. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the current molasses demand and supply situation, the estimated demand for drought feeding is running at approximately 8,500 tonnes of molasses per week. Spot sales of molasses at both Bundaberg and Mackay district mills have virtually ceased. Bundaberg Sugar, through its subsidiary Bundaberg Molasses, has arranged for three shipments from North Queensland. The first arrived last weekend and is already committed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, Bundaberg Molasses has been the first company to import molasses this year. A 6,000 tonne shipment is due to arrive in January from Thailand at a cost of $130 a tonne&mdash;approximately twice the normal price. Producers can claim half the sea freight, approximately $47 a tonne, or $23 under the state government's freight subsidy scheme. The shipment has also been forward booked. A second 6,000 tonne importation by Bundaberg Molasses is under consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mackay Sugar has just 10,000 tonnes of molasses left, much of which is already contracted out. Last week, orders in Mackay topped 2,500 tonnes alone. There is a possibility that it could be out of molasses by Christmas. For the other sugar mills, the story is the same. With the 1994 crushing season now complete, molasses spot sales are now non-existent. A crisis is looming and the government has denied its leadership role in alleviating the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In early October, I wrote to both the state and federal ministers in a bipartisan spirit. I was labelled a panic merchant on ABC radio by the Queensland minister, Ed Casey. He claimed that he had his finger on the pulse and was confident about supplies. Finally, he called a meeting of interested groups to discuss the issue along the lines I suggested, only to be clear that it was not a government problem but a commercial one, and that producers should plan ahead and forward book their supplies. Even when groups like the Cattlemen's Union&mdash;through the efforts of Queensland chair, Hazle Marland&mdash;was able to source supplies in North Queensland, the state government was able to make available only four to five rail wagons to transport this molasses to southern ports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) was slightly more sympathetic. After stating that there would be sufficient supplies to satisfy demand until the end of the year, he agreed that alternative supply sources will be required, but he disagreed about a subsidy. However, in a letter to me this week, he ruled out the suggestions for the Commonwealth to assist with the redirection of export bound molasses. But I am heartened that the minister has said that he will look at the New South Wales Farmers Federation proposal to retaim our core breeding stock. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

He was a person who put the community ahead of his own personal ambitions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just the Commonwealth Bank's action but the action of all banks which impose fees to encourage people to use automatic teller machines instead of supporting their own staff in the banks.

Those services clearly cannot be provided through a hole in the wall called an automatic teller when human beings can provide them. I think the measure should stand condemned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act was introduced into the parliament in 1984. It provided for the establishment of the Merit Protection and Review Agency as an independent statutory authority responsible for handling public servants' grievances and appeals relating to employment decisions. In broad terms, the authority's role is to ensure that personnel management practices of the Commonwealth departments and authorities reflect accepted principles for human resource management&mdash;including fairness, equity, ethics and accountability&mdash;and to protect the rights of individual Commonwealth employees, without limiting the ability of Commonwealth managers to conform with sound personnel management practices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Existing functions of the agency and its review committees are similar in nature to the administrative review functions of the ombudsman and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. However, generally the jurisdiction of these two bodies does not include Commonwealth employment matters. That is why the MPRA was established. The review committees which can currently be established by the MPRA include: disciplinary review committees, redeployment and retirement appeal committees, promotion appeal committees, reappointment review committees and reintegration assessment committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Amendment Bill proposes amendments to the MPRA legislation which would introduce some increase in the functions of the Merit Protection and Review Agency. Among the key amendments are a clarification of the MPRA's role in relation to the establishment of joint select committees. In particular, it is proposed that the principal act be amended to make it plain that it is a function of the MPRA to provide heads of government agencies with services in connection with the establishment, constitution and operation of joint selection committees. These amendments should facilitate the wider use of JSCs. The amendments appear to provide a statutory basis for the use of JSCs in all agencies which come within the MPRA's jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also provision for the MPRA to undertake specific employment related functions; for example, where there is a spill of positions or to establish an order of merit at the request of both the Commonwealth department or authority concerned and the relevant union. On the whole, the amendments appear to be largely of a technical or streamlining nature. For that reason, the opposition is not opposing this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not appear that the amendments would involve any increased administrative burden for Commonwealth departments or statutory authorities. With no expected financial impact stemming from the amendments, the MPRA's services in relation to JSCs are already generally provided on a user-pays basis by departments. The bill proposes an amendment that would consolidate the MPRA's ability to charge for these services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the issue of greatest concern is the possibility that some of the proposed amendments may expose the MPRA to a range of new pressures and work practices not commonly faced by review authorities. However, such concerns should not be overstated, provided that the agency maintains the arms-length involvement in a conflict of interest which we hope that it has shown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to two public service staffing matters which come within the context of both the spirit and the purpose of this and similar legislation. Members would be aware of the infamous Betteridge case. Until late 1993, Margaret Betteridge was a senior officer attached to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet as a fine arts and gifts adviser. Media reports alleged that she had been forced out of PM&amp;C for advising against the purchase of the infamous Thai teak dining room set for the Lodge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I referred this matter to the Public Service Commissioner on 2 November 1993. I asked the PSC to investigate reports that Mrs Betteridge had been berated by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), sent to Coventry, told it would be inadvisable for her to visit Kirribilli House and, subsequently, declared in excess of requirements. I understand that in response to my letter the PSC wrote to Mrs Betteridge saying that it was unclear whether there were grounds for the commission to take further action, and asking for her comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also understand that Mrs Betteridge replied to the PSC, to the effect that her letter provided details of the shabby treatment that I have referred to, which should have been subject to a detailed investigation. But, despite this, the PSC decided not to refer the matter to the MPRA, because, it claimed, Mrs Betteridge had not specifically asked for an inquiry. In a subsequent letter, addressed to me, of 19 January 1994, the PSC stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There does not appear to be any impropriety or unfairness in relation to the way in which Ms Betteridge was treated in relation to the offer of her voluntary redundancy in cl. 7(j) of the Australian Public Service Redeployment and Retirement (Redundancy) Award 1987.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say that the commissioner, therefore, had stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have concluded that there is nothing to justify any further action by this Commission or a reference, at this stage, to the Merit Protection and Review Agency under s. 56 of the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act. </PARA>
<PARA>This case raises a number of questions about the ability of public servants to provide independent advice to government, protected from maltreatment and abuse by ministers. It is not easy for members of parliament to actually address some of these issues&mdash;nor does it happen too often on the public record&mdash;because, by the nature of the secrecy within departments and the culture of the public service itself, public servants, to a large degree, are encouraged to put up or shut up. As a former public servant, I can speak with some authority on this subject. Nevertheless, it does, on occasion, create some disquiet that we go through the parliament providing legislation which is meant to ensure the protection of individual public servants, yet, when it gets down to the bottom line, this happens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the more recent cases have been the whistleblower cases, where it is alleged&mdash;at both the Commonwealth and the state level&mdash;that public servants who have `whistleblown' on their colleagues because of various breaches of regulations, misuses of public funds or other reasons have, in many cases, been sent to Coventry and had a pretty hard run of it. It is often difficult to take the actual cases in detail. They remain secret to a large degree, and the detail often does not become public until some years later. Nevertheless, it does open up the whole question as to whether or not loyalty to the service means loyalty to your department, come what may. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a former chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I remember numerous cases where public servants went to extraordinary lengths to protect the decisions made by their departments, even though they were well aware&mdash;as we were, as the interlocutors in each case&mdash;that the decisions taken were clearly wrong and had been based on wrong evidence, and that, consequently, the public outcomes were wrong and the costs to the public were often quite substantial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While one can say that, in a final analysis, much of this depends on fine judgment, it does, in my opinion, suggest a potential weakness in the MPRA system. In the case of the Betteridge matter, the escape clause was the allegation that Mrs Betteridge had not sought an investigation. That is not the same thing as questioning whether an investigation is necessary. There is, therefore, always a risk within the system that if people&mdash;and this applies to men and women&mdash;are not people of the highest integrity and, often, of considerable courage in their ability or willingness to stand against the government of the day, it is all too easy to take the easy option and to not conduct inquiries which perhaps ought to be conducted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not necessarily suggesting that that was the case in the Betteridge matter, because, as I have said, I have not had access to the full files and full details of that case. But it does open up that possibility. After all, if legislation is going to be seen to be effective, it must be so in the letter of the law, as well as in the effective application and implementation of the law as it stands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter which is of interest is the case of the two housekeepers sacked from the Prime Minister's official residence in Canberra, the Lodge, on 3 October last year. Again, I called for an independent inquiry to clear the reputations of these two housekeepers. A cook had also been sacked from the Lodge after complaints had been made that the house was not being run properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Senate estimates committee was told relations had deteriorated between staff at the Lodge and two staff members had refused to take directions from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The housekeepers, Bridgette Mullin and Gail Grey, both said that they thought it was a joke when they were dismissed without warning; they had no idea about the reasons for the sacking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They subsequently presented to us&mdash;and they were presented to the parliament&mdash;Christmas cards demonstrating a prima facie case of a close relationship between the employers and these ladies in question. Nevertheless, they were sacked over the phone and no specific reasons of any great value appear to have been given. Mrs Grey was simply told not to return to the Lodge to collect personal effects. Mrs Mullin said that she also thought it was a joke because she got on well with the Prime Minister, Mrs Keating, the children and other members of the staff. She said she really could not see any fault, any reason, why she should be dismissed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequently, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet stated before the estimates committee&mdash;in this case it was Anthea Tinney representing the department&mdash;that the staff members who had been sacked had not complied with rules relating to the use of a government credit card for the purchases made for the Lodge. The cook who, as I said, was sacked, said, `I had one Mastercard and the head cook had one Mastercard and anything I spent on my Mastercard for the house I told the department about.' She claimed that she had never been given any direction over the use of the credit card. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Mullin said her reluctance to inform the department about gossip within the house may have led to the sackings. I cannot speak in detail on that. `There are certain things the department has to know and the department did know them from us,' she said, `but as to what went on in the house with the Keatings, the children's friends and anything else like that, the department never knew about it. I never informed the department and neither did Gail because, quite frankly, it was none of the department's business.' In other words, Mrs Mullin was making the point that she was loyal to her employers throughout this whole matter&mdash;and the women continue to be so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that those two women to this day, to the best of my knowledge, have not been able to find permanent employment in Canberra. There is not much doubt about the fact that one of the reasons was that they were sacked from the Lodge, and the second reason could well be that the evidence given before the estimates committee of the Senate alleged that they had misused credit cards and matters such as that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the face of it, these are quite important charges but the point is that under the MPRA arrangements neither of those women has ever had the opportunity to clear her name. When you examine the reason you come up with the most interesting answer: that they are subject to the MOPS Act, the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act, which provides that members of staff may be sacked by members of parliament for any reason, which can remain undisclosed, and there is no recourse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether that was intended when the legislation was originally drafted is a moot point, but I think there can be a distinction made for staff appointments made for parliamentary purposes, that is, for servicing a member's electorate and a member's parliamentary responsibilities for which there has to be the closest personal relationship. That may require circumstances which need to be taken separately. But when we are talking about staff appointments of a domestic nature, the whole question needs to be raised as to whether the MOPS Act is the appropriate piece of legislation because under those circumstances staff members have no adequate protection at all as provided for under the MPRA legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise those two issues just to make the point that the system is not perfect by a long shot; there are serious issues at stake here, and a government which claims that it believes in industrial relations reforms which protect the interests of employees has undoubtedly got a fundamental moral responsibility to make sure that persons under the respective legislation&mdash;whether they be temporary public servants or permanent public servants, whether they be under the MPRA coverage or whether they be under the MOPS legislation&mdash;have a set of legal recourses which protect their interests where there is prima facie evidence that they got a bad deal from their employers and therefore, by extension, from the Australian government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Amendment Bill 1994 was introduced into the House of Representatives on 19 September, having passed the Senate on 31 August. As mentioned by the member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), the coalition does not oppose the bill. This bill makes a number of streamlining and technical amendments to the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act 1984.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Merit Protection and Review Agency, MPRA, performs an important function in the Australian Public Service, which I will refer to as the APS. The MPRA has jurisdiction over some 150,000 Commonwealth public servants as well as 13,000 Australian Capital Territory public servants and another 14,000 non-APS Commonwealth employees. The main function, as I understand it, of the MPRA is the hearing of appeals from unsuccessful applicants for promotion within the APS and in hearing grievance appeals where decisions or actions which affect an officer's employment are thought to be unfair or incorrect. Grievances may arise in cases involving improper discrimination, harassment, refusal to pay an increment or a range of other matters which may affect an employee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All that said, the MPRA devotes most of its resources to hearing appeals about promotional disputes. These are heard by promotion appeals committees, which have the power to reverse an initial decision. In the APS in 1992-93 there were 2,138 promotional appeals determined by the MPRA, and of these 11 per cent were upheld. The average time taken to complete a review was seven weeks. In the same period 132 grievance appeals were also heard, of which 50 per cent were either partly or wholly sustained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The MPRA can conduct reviews of non-appealable promotions to senior officer positions. These reviews cannot overturn the decision but can determine if there has been a defect in the selection process or a breach of section 33 of the Public Service Act. I do not know what happens if the review determines that there has been a breach, but I guess the Public Service Act takes over. The MPRA can also hear other matters such as disciplinary appeals. The main objective of the MPRA is to ensure that employment practices are subject to independent scrutiny and that preferment is on the basis of merit and not patronage. Merit is and should be the cornerstone upon which all APS employment is based. This is a theme I will come back to a little later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key amendments in this bill relate to the establishment and operation of joint selection committees, JSCs. JSCs are tripartite selection committees convened by a nominee of the MPRA and comprising representatives of the relevant government department or agency and the appropriate staff organisation, which I presume in most cases would be a union. To date, JSCs have been used under very limited circumstances to provide a streamlined merit selection process that does away with an appeals process at the end. This eliminates the need for several selection processes where there are many vacancies to deal with. Departments have preferred to use internal selection committees, allowing for an appeals process at the end of selection. No doubt they prefer in-house selection because it is easier to coordinate and in theory the selection panel should have a better understanding of departmental requirements, both long and short term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, the amendments provide that the MPRA will be able to issue guidelines on procedures to JSCs and the MPRA and members of the JSCs will not be subject to direction by any other person or any body or authority other than a court. Under current arrangements, JSCs operate as independent statutory committees, established in most cases under the Public Service Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments in this bill will clarify the MPRA's legal mandate to provide services, on a user pays basis, in connection with the establishment of JSCs to a number of statutory authorities and to the ACT Public Service. These amendments are of some minor concern because the bill confuses the role of the MPRA as a reviewing agency with its emerging role as a primary decision maker. This is not such a problem with the JSCs, since there is no avenue of appeal to the MPRA in terms of selection processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The potential for conflict arises where the MPRA is requested to review the outcome of a selection process into which it had direct input. This may occur where a review is requested of the MPRA after a JSC establishes an order of merit. The potential conflict will not, I believe, sufficiently impinge on the appeal nature of the MPRA so as to damage its impartiality. It should remain possible to preserve its ability to adequately perform its primary function of review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that, if the functions of the review and primary decision making become more blurred, the credibility of the organisation will be greatly diminished. The MPRA should remain primarily an agency to decide upon the appeals against employment related administrative decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the broader subject of public administration, there have been some worrying trends that go to the increased politicisation of the public sector. I am not referring to policy decisions of the government, nor to implementation of policy decisions by the Public Service. These policy decisions are the prerogative of the government of the day. Needless to say, I do not support many of the policies introduced by the present government. This is especially so in terms of social policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do have objections when the government uses its policy positions to politicise the Australian Public Service. Many of these policy positions are aimed at giving increased benefits to the chattering classes and, in some cases, to the femocrats. They involve public servants who are not representative of broad Australian opinion but who are politically motivated, sometimes social engineers and sometimes even saboteurs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some programs that are promoted as being worth while are on closer inspection just a method of providing a base from which political correctness can be spread throughout the Public Service. These programs are usually effective in managing to eliminate public servants who are not politically correct. Such public servants are not outed from the public sector but are marginalised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Industrial Relations has in the last two years been embarking upon establishing politically correct sections&mdash;such as its work and family unit, its labour relations equity unit, its equal pay unit and its disability pay unit. All these Public Service sections appear to the outsider, looking in, to have a proper function that is easily defensible. Unfortunately, they have doubles in other departments that undertake the same or similar roles. Duplicates exist in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Affirmative Action Agency and the Department of Human Services and Health, by way of example. To have various government bodies, departments and agencies each duplicating what the other does and increasingly doubling up is merely wanton waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Labor were serious about reducing the budget deficit, Mr Deputy Speaker, it would start with stopping the increase in the size of the Australian Public Service and re-evaluating all programs undertaken over the past 10 years or so. If a program is of little worth to the society as a whole, or has no economic benefit, it deserves to be wound up. These politically correct units that I have mentioned are only examples of those that are spreading throughout the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What benefits do these units provide to the average person? I suggest they offer no benefit, except that of providing the Labor Party with a platform from which it can extend its sociopolitical network. Such units, and the policies they pursue, tie lobby groups into the government and lead to their eventual absorption. Just look at the progress of Mr Phillip Toyne: he went from the position of Director of the Australian Conservation Foundation to that of a consultant to the Special Minister of State (Mr Walker) on Mabo, and now he has been appointed Deputy Secretary of the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rub-off for the normal public servant has been deleterious. As mentioned earlier, merit is supposed to be the sole means by which public servants win promotions, but the reality is very often different, especially for those who are out of step with the forces of political correctness. Equal employment opportunity, EEO, is the catchcry in the Public Service, and is often linked to affirmative action. EEO expresses admirable objectives when it is based on the merit principle. However, when it becomes a tool to promote an officer of a preferred political colour, or a method of positively discriminating in favour of so-called target groups such as women, indigenous Australians, disabled people and people from non-English speaking backgrounds, it becomes clear that merit has been cast aside in favour of a less equitable, though politically correct, selection process. This is not the case in all areas of the Public Service, though it is increasingly gaining in importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pursuit of affirmative action usually revolves around the belief by members of a selection panel that past injustices have been suffered by some of those applying for a job, whilst other applicants might be considered members of a group that has in some way benefited from its status in the past. A white Anglo-Saxon Protestant male with centre right political leanings is a sure-fire target for selection panels that are politically correct. There is never overt acknowledgment of a bias towards members of a target group in terms of applying to get a job, yet I am reliably advised that it is there. Even those members of a selection panel who disagree with the politically correct forces can feel the pressure to kowtow to the wishes of the others&mdash;who, after all, are only the embodiment of the corporate spirit of their department, division or branch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the picture I have presented is not taken to apply to the whole of the Public Service, because there is a majority of public servants who are more interested in getting the job done than in becoming embroiled in destructive bureaucratic babbles. If the process is as faulty and prone to manipulation as I suggest, it can be asked why the victims of such actions do not appeal to the MPRA. Some of them do, I am told, but I am certain the vast majority are not prepared to rock the boat and risk further alienation. To stand up for his or her rights can put an officer's long-term career opportunities in serious jeopardy. Further, no doubt many APS officers in this position have little or no faith in the MPRA taking their appeals seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As recently as August of this year, the Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing released its report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In the public interest</EMPHASIS>. This report made some interesting comments on the performance of the MPRA in responding to the claims of whistleblowers to the effect that they had been victimised and harassed, in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The MPRA was strongly criticised for their handling of cases involving whistleblowers in evidence given to the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whistleblowers had no faith in the MPRA as an agency which could assist or protect them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee itself was deeply concerned by the attitude and approach of the MPRA to whistleblowers and whistleblowing problems as demonstrated by the tenor of its evidence.</PARA>
<PARA>If whistleblowers do not feel secure in going to the MPRA, officers who are considered a threat to political correctness would also feel the MPRA will not adequately protect their interests against the pressures of intimidation and victimisation. The MPRA should take such concerns very seriously indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Merit must be the sole basis of job selection. Stringent guidelines need to be enforced by departments and agencies to prevent the undermining of the public sector by ideologically motivated modernist, feminist, sexist or whatever forces. Where the selection process is compromised it is the APS itself that will suffer, especially in the longer term as mediocre people rise to positions of power and the talented leave for better work environments. This should be of prime concern to the MPRA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor, of course, is covertly, and in some cases overtly, opposed to merit being the principle upon which job selection should be based. One has only to look at the newly introduced quota system of 35 per cent for women MPs to be met by the turn of the century to understand what I mean. The increase in the JSCs offers the MPRA an opportunity to enshrine the principle of merit in the selection process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the public sector generally, given the size of the budget deficit and this government's inability to meet its privatisation schedule as set out in the current budget, action now needs to be taken to rein in public expenditure. Current fiscal imbalance needs to be dealt with, not by increasing taxes but by showing a firm hand and reining in recurrent expenditure. This means cutting back in the public sector. </PARA>

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">February 1992&mdash;Policy Reforms</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>On 26 February 1992, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced as part of the One Nation statement the most comprehensive program of international aviation reforms ever to be undertaken in this country. Included in this were the decisions to allow more than one Australian carrier to operate air services into and out of Australia (the so called `multiple designation' policy) and to allow Qantas access to domestic markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This removed the longstanding distinctions between international and domestic aviation in Australia and allowed the benefits of domestic deregulation to flow through to international operations. A little more than two years down the track, these announced reforms have come to fruition with across the board gains for our consumer, trade and inbound tourism interests. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Establishment of the International Air Services Commission</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To give effect to the new multiple designation policy, the parliament passed the International Air Services Commission Act 1992 (the act) and, through it, established the International Air Services Commission (IASC) which has the responsibility for allocating to Australian carriers aviation rights negotiated internationally by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act ensures that route allocation decisions are made within a framework of:</PARA>

<PARA>Under the act, the commission must determine the merits of competing claims according to public benefit criteria spelt out in an accompanying policy statement. This requires the commission, in assessing applications, to take account of the extent to which each application:</PARA>

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The commission's achievements</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Since its establishment, the commission has played an important part in ensuring the success of Australia's new aviation policy. Ansett began services to Indonesia in September 1993 and has announced plans for full-scale international market entry in September this year with Boeing 747 services to Japan and Hong Kong. During the same period, the commission has awarded Qantas the capacity entitlements necessary to maintain that airline's status as a major world carrier. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Impact on Australia's approach to bilateral negotiations</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>In going down this path, the government also needed to negotiate more expansive route and capacity entitlements required to support new entrants on prime routes and to maintain the growth momentum of Qantas. The move to multiple designation has therefore had the important and intended consequence of requiring Australia to further liberalise its approach to bilateral aviation negotiations.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been true particularly in the rapidly growing markets of South-East Asia and north Asia where major increases in capacity have been achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the beginning of 1992, the government has conducted an extensive program of bilateral air services negotiations with more than 30 countries. As a result of this, multiple designation provisions exist in the great majority of Australia's air services agreements, and in almost all major Asian markets. Importantly, the route rights and capacity entitlements required by the airlines to give effect to their expansion plans are in place. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Need to maintain the momentum</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy path on which we have embarked is undoubtedly the right one for Australia. The purpose of this bill is to build on the good work that has already been done by the IASC in helping to re-shape Australia's international aviation sector.The IASC has been operating for over two years. As with any new undertaking, there is a need to reflect on whether things can be done differently and, if so, whether the results will be better for the changes introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill proposes a number of amendments to the IASC Act of an essentially technical nature, designed to refine and streamline the commission's processes in recognition of the commercial imperatives under which our airlines operate. The changes proposed will lead to more efficient delivery of the government's reforms and will benefit the airline industry as a result. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Broadening the scope of capacity considered under the act</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a need to bring air services on the Taiwan route within the scope of the act. Currently, Taiwan is excluded from the act as there is no formal government to government air services agreement in place between Australia and Taiwan. Taiwan-Australia traffic, particularly inbound tourist traffic, is growing strongly and Taiwan is forecast to be one of Australia's major markets over the course of the next five years. Capacity on the Taiwan route is operated by Australia Asia Airlines, a Qantas subsidiary, under approvals issued by the Secretary to the Department of Transport. Whilst these arrangements provide Qantas with the necessary operational authority, IASC determinations would provide the certainty which Qantas and any new entrants would require. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will ensure that decisions on Taiwan capacity can be made by the commission and will enable capacity currently being operated by Australia Asia to be treated as if it had originally been allocated by the IASC. It will enable the Qantas board to identify with certainty the company's route rights and entitlements in the prospectus to be prepared for the Qantas sale. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Streamlined application and evaluation procedures</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before you also establishes a basis for the commission to deal more expeditiously with applications for capacity or for minor variations to determinations. It makes provision for the commission to deal with some types of applications without necessarily applying the full range of criteria spelt out in the policy statement on each and every occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situations in which a more streamlined evaluation process may be appropriate include where:</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">there are no submissions opposing allocation of capacity to an applicant; or</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">an application for the allocation of capacity is opposed on particular grounds and only the public benefit tests relevant to those grounds need be applied. </PARA>
<PARA>Along similar lines, the bill provides for expedited procedures to be applied when, for example, a carrier wishes only to hand back capacity previously allocated to it. This reduces the time which other carriers may have to wait to then be able to apply for the available capacity under the usual procedures. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Operational decisions in special circumstances</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some circumstances, the act prevents minor operational decisions, such as approval of supplementary services in peak periods, or to allow for minor changes in aircraft seating or aircraft type, from being approved. This can inhibit flexible airline operations by Australian carriers in a manner not faced by foreign airlines operating into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government proposes to remedy this by allowing the Secretary to the Department of Transport to make minor and temporary operational decisions without prior reference to the IASC. The types of decisions which the secretary could make will be prescribed by regulation under the act to allow parliamentary scrutiny to ensure that the commission's processes and independence are respected. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Use of capacity by different members of a corporate group</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act envisages that there will be circumstances when an airline awarded capacity will want to transfer that capacity to another party and it already contains provisions for this purpose. This bill also provides Australian carriers with the flexibility to operate capacity through different members of the same corporate group such as wholly owned subsidiaries or holding companies which are Australian carriers, subject to appropriate conditions being imposed by the commission. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Internal processes of the IASC</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill contains a number of miscellaneous provisions designed to improve the commission's flexibility in its proceedings and day-to-day operations. These include:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The broad thrust of these amendments is to introduce as much flexibility to the process of allocating aviation rights as possible whilst retaining the need to apply proper public benefit tests where appropriate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition is proposing to support the International Air Services Commission Amendment Bill 1994, which is basically of a routine nature and sets out to achieve various amendments to the legislation, which primarily relates to the International Air Services Commission. Of course, it is well known that international air travel support is governed by a web of bilateral air service agreements which are negotiated on a government-to-government basis. These air service agreements cover matters such as market access, air routes and frequency of flights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also well known that before 1992 Qantas was designated by the government as Australia's sole international carrier. I am pleased to say that that is no longer the case because, whilst Qantas has established an excellent international reputation, the simple facts are that over time I have seen circumstances where the airfreight component of these services has been significantly under-available, particularly in my state of Western Australia when we look at passenger demand relative to our population base and our isolation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was simply no alternative because under this designated carrier arrangement, whilst certain permission will be given from time to time to allow another carrier to come in to collect freight&mdash;such as lobster, wild flowers, lamb or many other things that my state wishes to export through the process of airfreight&mdash;people were frequently told that they could not deliver any goods to Australia, making the service totally unviable in terms of cost. These sorts of things were unsatisfactory and, to the extent they might still exist, they are totally unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992 the government announced that it would permit other Australian airlines to fly international routes. It also announced that it would negotiate Australia's air services agreement to enable more than one carrier to fly on each route, a policy known as multiple designation. As a consequence, the International Air Services Commission was established to allocate capacity rights to Australian carriers. Since 1992 the IASC has granted Ansett the right to fly a number of international routes. It has also granted a freight carrier, National Airlines, unlimited rights to carry cargo between Australia and New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill proposes a series of essentially routine amendments to the act which cover a wide range of issues and can be classified into four groups. There is the issue of Taiwan, which, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr O'Keefe) has just said, is an extremely important developing market. Taiwan has always created difficulties for Australia due to the attitude of China that Taiwan is part of that country and could not be dealt with on a government-to-government basis in any negotiations we have had to establish a trade post there through the chamber of commerce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here again we find we are having to create within our legislation the ability for the IASC to actually negotiate with any region that is part of a foreign country. So we are giving at least some tacit admission to the fact that we still perceive Taiwan as part of China, but that we can deal with it separately. One can view that in various ways. Taiwan is quite clearly a country standing on its own two feet in many ways and dealing with the world in that fashion. If it ever becomes part of China that will be a decision of the residents of Taiwan. Nevertheless it is probably a practical way of developing a very important market for Australia, particularly in terms of inbound tourism, and the coalition accepts the need for this particular device. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next move is to streamline application and evaluation procedures. Section 7(3) of the act requires the commission to make capacity allocation determinations according to criteria set out by the minister for transport in policy statements issued under section 11 of the act. The bill proposes to empower the minister to issue abbreviated criteria that would apply in situations where there was no need for the commission to undertake the full assessment process. This would include the following situations: where capacity was unlimited under a particular bilateral agreement, for instance, the Australia-New Zealand route; where no submissions were received opposing the allocation of capacity; where only one application for capacity was made; or where an application for capacity was opposed but not under all of the criteria. That seems reasonably sensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 9 of the bill would allow the commission to permit carriers to transfer their capacity rights to their wholly-owned subsidiaries. The proposed amendment would rectify an anomaly in the current act which forced Ansett to create a new company, Ansett International, to run its international operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act currently requires the IASC to invite public submissions whenever a carrier applies for a determination to vary its capacity. The commission would, as a result, be required to call for public submissions if a carrier wished to hand back a portion of its entitlements. Section 12 of the bill would remove the consultation requirement for reviews in which the only effect of the varied determination would be to reduce the capacity allocated to the carrier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other areas is operational decisions in special circumstances. Put simply, the bill would permit the department to approve minor and temporary operational decisions without reference to the IASC. The scope of the department's authority would be delineated by regulation. Obviously, the coalition would always take an interest in those regulations to ensure that the purposes of the bill were maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the final segment, which deals with the internal processes of the IASC. The bill includes a number of miscellaneous provisions intended to streamline the day-to-day operations of the commission. The proposed new sections would permit the commission to deal with two or more matters in the same determination; allow the commission to operate with only two of its three members present; tighten the provisions in the act relating to the disclosure by commissioners of their pecuniary interest; and reduce the administrative costs associated with publishing determinations. All of those matters are eminently sensible, although one might wonder what would happen with only two commissioners present if they held differing views. Obviously, the purpose of having three is that there would always be a two to one decision one way or the other, but presumably this operation will occur as in this very place, where there are expected to be no contentious issues arising. I assume the department has made some provisions to ascertain the circumstances before it allows that situation to arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the major airlines are in favour of things which tend to reduce difficulty for them in conducting their business, and that is always to be encouraged. In fact, one of the great problems associated with so many of our trading activities here in Australia, as we pointed out with the ANL situation, is that we tend to burden sections of our own community by too much regulation&mdash;for example, in the local tourist industry, in the way that people get here. We must always remember that, whilst we might be protecting the interests of Qantas and its one private shareholder, British Airways, and in the future presumably a number of other shareholders, by giving them privileged rights, we certainly do not necessarily do that for the hundreds of thousands of people who necessarily gain their employment by servicing the local tourist industry. We continue to create preferential treatment in certain segments of industry at the expense of all the other components. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is very clear in the case of ANL. It is the only reason that we sustain cabotage on our coastline. As I pointed out in the parliament yesterday, that is precluding Western Australian grain growers from assisting to alleviate the effects of the drought and benefiting from the current circumstances here on the eastern seaboard. It is just silly to suggest that our local sea transport system is so costly and inefficient that it is cheaper to bring grain to starving livestock in the eastern areas from North America than it is to bring it from Western Australia, not to mention the associated quarantine problems that can occur with importation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very silly to use a system of licensing of this nature to make sure that the airlines prosper when, occasionally at least, through that process we put up barriers to the prosperity of our tourist operations. That has always got to be considered, and I trust that that will be fundamental to the determinations of the IASC. I might add that the government has overridden what otherwise might have been the determination in terms of the extended activities of Air New Zealand, admittedly in participating in the domestic routes. Again we have an attempt to prop up the value of Qantas, the international carrier, with determinations and breaking of international agreements, for the simple reason that the government wants to sell it and get extra value for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a very short-sighted view in a couple of respects. I do not think the prospective shareholders will be caught by that particular proposal. They are going to demand some guarantees as to Qantas's domestic rights before they revalue the property. They will want to know that this arrangement is not going to cease the minute they have paid their money. Moreover, if that promise were given, we would be denying internal tourism within Australia, we would be denying business the best competitive price domestically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Competition has been proven time and time again to be the only effective determinant of price. Of course, in that situation it always comes to the point where those other components of the industry which are far bigger and employ far more people can prosper. If we make it too expensive to get around Australia, either international tourists will not come or they will visit a single destination. We are well aware that many in the Asian region do not want that sort of tourism. They typically want to move from place to place and they need to do that in a package which is competitive with what other international destinations offer. When buying a ticket to fly to Paris recently, I was offered three free internal trips. That was the way the company got business; it got me. </PARA>

I find it outrageous that when I am travelling I am often confronted with the fact, as on this occasion, that I have to find $15,000 out of my own bank account to pay up front for the privilege of getting the best price on a trip to Europe to carry out my parliamentary duties. Had I chosen to pay Qantas an extra $2,000 or $3,000 the government would have paid it direct.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am fed up with the concept of seeking privilege at a check-out counter. I am prepared to pay my way, provided I get the most competitive price. If that gives me a first-class ticket, I am entitled to it. I refuse point-blank to be offered this upgrade option. I find it demeaning and it is doubly wrong when some other carrier is prepared to give me that trip at that price. If it is happening to me as a member of parliament, it is happening to the general public. As I say, the major losers on that on in-bound tourism are our local tourist operators. People take other options. Mr Speaker's office should be looking at the rights of members in this regard and telling them that they can book where they like.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Air New Zealand, an international carrier, is subject to the legislation we are dealing with today. It was outrageous and stupid of the government to break off that international agreement. Many of its constituency will be the big losers from that.

The market in airfares should be highly competitive to give those people&mdash;who frequently are good Labor voters&mdash;the chance to visit granny or others.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those people's chances of doing just that have been reduced, at least marginally, by the government's decision to remove a viable competitor. As we learnt, it is no good trying to license companies such as Compass Airlines&mdash;as great a job as it did in creating competition&mdash;because starting a greenfields operation against the established majors is just too difficult. The only way to get true competition is to have another major on the route. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for O'Connor, who seems so supportive of Air New Zealand, obviously has not been to New Zealand for some time or he would see that pre-customs clearance advantaged people who wanted to fly Air New Zealand. At Auckland airport  the service is a lot better through the terminal for an Air New Zealand flight than for a Qantas flight. I do not know whether that is helping competition or not or whether that is advantaging one player as opposed to the other. So the member for O'Connor ought to look at the facts rather than the fiction that he wants to establish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the government has done in the competition area is endeavour to get as many new entrants onto the trunk routes as possible but also put pressure on both the major operators in Australia to lower prices. Honourable members will have seen that there has been a significant reduction in prices in recent years on the major trunk routes in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are having a little discussion in other parts of the parliament at present about whether we just want to allow competition willy-nilly by letting anybody into the race. One of the problems with airlines, in particular, and also with long distance coaches, is that if those industries are to have the confidence of the travelling public the safety regulations have to be pretty strict. The member for O'Connor ought to think about some of those matters before he just jumps in at the deep end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ought to address ourselves to what this bill is about: refining and streamlining the International Air Services Commission's process in recognition of the commercial imperatives under which airlines in Australia operate.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members might recall that the commission was set up in 1992, following the announcement of the One Nation statement that Australia would adopt the policy of multiple designation of international air services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has been a dramatic change from the past in that Qantas was the only international designator in this country, and we have now widened that specifically. That has had the effect of allowing more than one carrier to operate routes in and out of Australia. It brings the benefits of increased competition and, as the member for O'Connor said, stimulates inbound tourism and trade. An essential part of that process is that the commission was given a statutory responsibility to issue determinations which allocate air service rights to the various Australian carriers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should all recall that tourism is one of Australia's greatest exports, that all those dollars that come in from inbound tourism add very dramatically to the balance of payments for this country. Tourism also provides employment in those parts of Australia where there are not the same attractions that the major capitals offer. Tourism has become a very good mechanism for providing regional employment and in providing employment in many areas which are targeted at young people. I remember our former colleague, John Brown, who was the minister for tourism, saying that no-one is ever going to be able to invent a machine that will make a bed. In the hospitality industry there are jobs that cannot be replaced by mechanisation and computerisation. It is a very good industry for expanding employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that has increased inbound tourism has been the recognition by the government that we would have new entrants among the Australian flag carriers. Since the commission's establishment, it has played a very important role in ensuring the success of Australia's new aviation policy. Over the past two years, it has handled a heavy workload, and has managed the difficult task of balancing commercial airline interests against the broader national interests in what all would agree has been a highly professional manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The highlights over the past year have been the commission's determinations in allocating capacity to the Japan, Hong Kong and Korea routes. The capacity was allocated to Ansett, as a new entrant on these routes, and an additional capacity was allocated to Qantas, which is the incumbent carrier. Ansett began services to Bali, in Indonesia, in September last year. It is currently operating six services a week there. In September, Ansett commenced full-scale international operations with a Boeing 747 service to Japan and Hong Kong. Ansett now operates five 747 services a week to the new Kensai airport in Osaka and three Boeing 747 services a week to Hong Kong. From the end of October this year, the company also had the right to operate a Boeing 747, equivalent to 1.2 units per week, to Korea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the allocation of passenger capacity, the commission has also made an allocation of freight capacity to a new entrant, which is National Airlines, on the New Zealand route. The commission's determination, allocating capacity to Ansett and National Airlines, has increased competition on the routes on which those airlines have introduced services. That is of benefit to both exporters from here and importers from New Zealand. It benefits that one market which we are trying to create between Australia and New Zealand. The sooner Air New Zealand fulfils its obligations under the memorandum of understanding, the sooner we will be able to expand that market in passenger capacity. Proportionately, New Zealanders constitute the largest number of tourists coming into Australia, whilst more Australian tourists go to New Zealand than do any other nationality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That trans-Tasman route should be one where there are low fares, in order to encourage movement between our two countries. I have always held the belief&mdash;which is anathema to New Zealanders&mdash;that ultimately there ought to be some stronger union between Australia and New Zealand. The New Zealanders came to the Federation conferences at the end of the last century and, unfortunately, decided that they did not want to proceed. But New Zealand is the only other country that is taken account of in our constitution; there is provision in the Australian constitution for a union between Australia and New Zealand. As we improve the economic and transport links between our two countries and improve the movement of people between our two countries, I hope that those developments might eventually foster the idea that we should come a little bit closer in political as well as in economic areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose that is like asking people from Melbourne to like Sydney-siders. The member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) was pretty keen on belting out the fact that people in the west are a bit different from the people here on the east coast. I think there is a lot of merit in developing a closer unity between New Zealand and Australia, and anything that drives down prices on the aviation highway between here and there is a good thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission's determinations and decisions have been made with a view to increasing inbound tourism and international trade and bringing benefits to Australian consumers by reduced airfares. Apart from the commission's determinations and decisions allocating capacity, the commission has also conducted a detailed assessment of the business plans and service proposals of a number of prospective start-up airlines, particularly the routes to Japan, Greece and the Netherlands. Two of these routes have a business orientation and one is a great familial destination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It has always struck me that there is a need for more capacity to Athens. To my mind, it is a sorrow that Qantas stopped flying to Athens some years ago. A large number of Australian citizens who return to their former homeland for holidays or for family matters have been inconvenienced by that. If they want to fly Qantas, they now have to travel to London or Frankfurt and make an on-connection. In the main, they then choose to fly Olympic Airlines. That is revenue that is lost to an Australian carrier. The sooner we get another carrier on that route the better. From talking to the people in my electorate&mdash;they might give me a bit of a biased sample, because I think I have the largest Greek community in Sydney&mdash;I know that if there was an Australian carrier on that route they would certainly patronise it, as they did Qantas when Qantas was on the route. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The results of the commission's deliberations during the last financial year have seen it allocate more than 25 Boeing 747 equivalent units of capacity on routes to eight countries. These allocations provide for an additional 10,230 seats per week between Australia and these countries, increasing total capacity allocated to Australian carriers on the routes by more than 40 per cent. Those airlines were all making money, so obviously the capacity was there to be taken off other international carriers flying into Australia. When we look at that Pacific route, which is probably one of the best serviced routes in the world, with high class, high capacity aeroplanes, I think there is room for more Australian entrants to do the job of bringing tourists to this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking to the future, the commission currently has under consideration applications for capacity or reviews to determinations on 13 routes. The commission has clearly achieved an impressive outcome during the two years since its inception. I think all members of the House will support the bill as it will build on the good work that has already been done. I note that the opposition has said that it will support the bill. The changes that are outlined in the bill will lead to a more efficient delivery of the government's reforms in the aviation industry and will benefit the airline industry as a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments proposed will introduce as much flexibility to the process of allocating aviation rights as possible, whilst retaining the need to apply proper public benefit tests where appropriate. That is one of the tests that is being applied on the New Zealand route&mdash;that there is a framework that both sides agree to. When the New Zealand party fulfils its side of the obligation, then it will get the traffic on the Australian routes. We cannot allocate these rights willy-nilly; we have to apply a public benefit test. We are allocating a government licence and, while it is a licence system rather than a free-for-all, a public benefit test should always apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are trying to provide less burdensome and time consuming procedures. The changes proposed will assist the aviation industry's ability to respond to new commercial opportunities, while, from the government's point of view, they will place less pressure on the commission's limited resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, in the lead-up to the Qantas float next year, the changes proposed in this bill will provide Qantas with greater certainty regarding its rights and entitlements. That will enable the Qantas board to approach the public with the confidence that it should be able to, in ensuring that it gets the maximum public benefit for the taxpayers of Australia through that float. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the commission has done a good job. It has done it in a lean administrative way. There seems to be a fair amount of goodwill between the commission and the carriers. There have been a couple of unfortunate incidents whereby a carrier was given an allocation and still has not taken off, but I think that is probably a commercial reality in times of tight money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that this is a sensible way for the government to allocate capacity to carriers other than Qantas. It has also ensured that we have got over the anomaly we had in the past, whereby there were a number of routes that Australian airlines were able to fly on but, because Qantas was the only designated international carrier, those routes were never used. The route to Athens, in particular, is one of those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the government has put into this system now is a level of flexibility that will allow other entrants to make commercial decisions about whether they think they can make a buck on that route, rather than what used to happen. Qantas used to make a commercial decision&mdash;that it could not afford to buy another aeroplane, that it did not have the capacity or that it wanted to redeploy the aeroplanes it had to some more profitable route&mdash;and we had routes that people wanted to fly along on Australian airlines, with no Australian carriers running on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that we should be promoting in international travel is the idea that one's visit to Australia begins at the terminal in the country one is leaving. We should be encouraging as many people as possible to travel on Australian carriers when travelling to Australia, so that they begin to get that flavour as soon as they leave home. Having more entrants will expand our capacity to do that. I think that this process has done nothing but add good to the industry, so I commend the bill to the Committee and I thank the opposition for its support of the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why would the opposition not support the International Air Services Commission Amendment Bill? It was opposition policy for the last federal election. I do not say that in any silly sense, but to point out that there have been some difficulties identified with the operations of the IASC since its inception in 1992. There is no doubt that the government's amendments are designed to make sure that the full flexibility of the IASC is achieved, and that the role of the IASC is clearly defined in future years. I think that that particular organisation is going to have a very busy existence. I was delighted to see that the government did pick up some of the suggestions that we were making and, indeed, the ideas that we would have implemented in government had we been elected last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One always has a period of settling down, and the IASC certainly had a period in which it was really finding its feet. In the original design of the commission there was a lack of flexibility, and there was some red tape that really did not allow it to meet the demands of the aviation industry with the speed that the industry obviously wanted. I said just a moment ago that the IASC is going to be a very busy instrument in coming years, and I think that is correct for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the tremendous growth of tourism in Australia and, indeed, the projections of future growth in international tourism, especially around Asia and the Pacific rim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When groups such as the World Tourism and Travel Council estimate that by the year 2000 there will be 140 million Asian people travelling offshore for their holidays each year, it is to be hoped that Australia would get better than one per cent of that particular market. If we are looking at adding that sort of figure to our inbound tourism, we are going to have to have a tremendous lift in the capacity of airlines in and out of Australia during the remainder of this particular decade. Obviously, we all want to see Australian carriers participating in that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what the IASC is all about. It is about allocating space and making sure not only that we have the capacity to look after the two existing carriers but also that the possibility of future carriers coming into the Australian market is not going to be stifled. With 140 million Asian travellers, if we got 10 per cent of that traffic into Australia&mdash;and there is no reason that we could not&mdash;we would have to triple the capacity operating into Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We talk about the tremendous advent of the third runway in Sydney but, quite frankly, we would have needed Badgerys Creek much more quickly than that. There would be tremendous demands on airports such as Brisbane and Cairns and, certainly, on those of some of the other cities. That is the magnitude of the task that Australia is going to have to face over the remainder of this decade, if we are going to get our full and fair share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The IASC is going to have a busy time, in as much as the very nature of international airline operations is changing. We are seeing this now in terms of the privatisation of Qantas. British Airways has gone in as a 25 per cent stakeholder in Qantas and there is no reason to doubt that British Airways will be the largest foreign stakeholder in Qantas, once it is off the government books and is fully privatised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are seeing, around the world now, cross-ownerships and alliances which mean that we will have a much different international aviation sector to contend with in coming years. British Airways and Qantas make no secret of the fact that they want a seam-free operation, which is all about comparable equipment, similar layouts for aircraft, the capacity to be able to substitute each other's aircraft on particular routes, common spare parts and common catering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The British Airways international alliance is going to be one of the biggest. We can see what is happening in that respect. It has got a major holding with an American carrier called US Air, and they want to make sure that they can maximise their holding&mdash;although they have got some problems with the US government&mdash;to give them the world networks that would allow them to virtually operate as one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to muse on what the Qantas role as part of that international alliance might be in years to come. In a commercial sense, probably what is already being looked at is the prospect that Qantas become very much the dominant carrier in the Asia Pacific. We will probably see, in the future, a carrier such as Qantas operating on its present existing routes but also operating on a few of the existing British Airways routes around that Pacific area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The British Airways network could probably be described as being in the shape of a big dumbbell. By that I mean that we would probably see many of the British Airways services coming out of the UK and Europe and terminating in places like Singapore, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong or even Japan, with Qantas picking up the business from those points. The other terminating point for British Airways services would probably be the west coast of the United States, with Qantas taking on the traffic there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that further down the line it might make a lot of commercial sense for Qantas to pull out of some of those European routes on which it is operating at the moment. We all rather look forward to the investigation by the Trade Practices Commission into the common fare regime that is being talked about between British Airways and Qantas. If that is approved, in an Australian sense, it will obviously make a lot sense for them to go into this seamless service. There may be opportunities for other Australian carriers, and especially specialist carriers, to pick off some of those routes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Watson, before he sat down, was talking about the situation on the Athens route. Qantas always said that it could not make money on the Athens route, so it amazed me that every other Asian carrier managed to get a few through services to Athens out of Australia as quickly as they possibly could when those services came off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Athens is a case in point. When one looks at the figures for the physical traffic that operates between Australia and Greece, one finds that they are not inconsiderable, and one would think that there would be room there for a specialist operation. If Qantas, for example, decided to pull off Rome, there would be some tremendous traffic there. There might be opportunities for another Australian carrier to start moving into that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This really is going to have to be determined in the future by the IASC. With the combination of the incredible growth of inbound tourism and the potential growth of inbound tourism, plus the changing nature of the international aviation business, it is important that Australia does maintain a competitive edge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), was talking earlier about the need for competition on international routes. I just flag that one of the things that worries me is that if we are not absolutely careful, and if the IASC does not have the full independence and flexibility to grant rights for additional carriers, we could end up going the way that Great Britain has gone in terms of its semi-deregulation of the international aviation process. It is very interesting to look at the UK figures. Prior to the liberalisation of the international aviation regime, British Airways as the national carrier had 80 per cent of the business out of Britain. Ten years down the track, British Airways now has 87 per cent of the business. One wonders whether or not that has necessarily been good for the British travelling public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the last thing that we really would want to see happen in Australia is a return to the `heavenly twins' that we had in the pre-deregulation days, when we had two carriers wandering around the domestic skies and setting up the business. I would not suggest that this is going to happen in an international sense, but I think we have got to flag it. The last thing that we would want would be a suggestion that maybe we have the possibility of only two carriers which could block out all other competition in an international sense. That will not necessarily happen, but it may happen in this particular part of the Pacific. We have already heard about what is going to happen when competition is introduced to the Hong Kong route, and about an $800 fare that can be bought from any travel agency at the moment on two of the operators on that particular route. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that respect I would also like to raise the issue of the New Zealand situation. The member for Watson was quite off-beam when he started talking about what the common aviation market was all about. The proposed agreement between Australia and New Zealand included the right for any Australian or New Zealand carrier to fly between the two countries or within the two countries, and there was to be really no restriction. The honourable member was not strictly correct in saying that New Zealand did not meet the obligations of the memorandum of understanding that he quoted. The press on both sides of the Tasman have publicised quite fulsomely the fact that, when it came to the common boundaries and the immigration arrangements, it was the Australian officials who told New Zealand in April this year that they were not terribly concerned about what was going on. The reality of this whole debacle is partly about the Qantas float, but it is also partly about the present situation with Ansett. That aside, it would appear that the common aviation market is being put on hold and Air New Zealand has promised to go and have another look at the Ansett books to see whether there might be some room to move there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also stress that it may cause some tremendous problems in New Zealand in terms of the trade practices legislation there if Air New Zealand has a holding in the parent company of Ansett New Zealand. I suppose that that might be the next issue that will come up and have to be overcome. But the concept of the common aviation market, and the right of any Australian carrier or any New Zealand carrier to operate between the two countries and within those two countries, has enormous potential. Particularly for Australia, there is enormous potential to foster that competition and Australia really has a very great advantage in being able to open up completely new destinations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy National Party Whip, the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), was here before. I know the tremendous enthusiasm he has had, for example, for some charter flights that were operated between New Zealand and Coffs Harbour. Basically what we are talking about is the right for any carrier to be able to fly between any two ports in Australia and New Zealand. I would have thought that it would be very much to the advantage of places like Coffs Harbour&mdash;certainly, in my own neck of the woods, the Gold Coast, the Sunshine Coast of Queensland and North Queensland&mdash;to have this open slather capacity that could be operated by aircraft of the right size. Such aircraft are contained in the fleets of both countries, and we could have seen some tremendous advantages for the regional areas of Australia. Hopefully we actually will see some tremendous advantages in the regional areas of Australia when this free market is ultimately opened up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it has got very little to do with this bill, may I also say that I was surprised at the attitude that was taken by the government. I would have thought that some very great advantages would come about should Air New Zealand&mdash;and I stress `should Air New Zealand'&mdash;ultimately decide that it would operate some limited domestic services within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the actual bill itself is terribly important in as much as one of its prime focuses, apart from the flexibility it provides, is the focus on Taiwan and the fact that now at last there is a relatively easy procedure to go through to make sure that that capacity is available. In Taiwan this year the government is requiring 20 per cent of the population to go overseas for a holiday. That is almost by government decree. It has been decreed for two reasons: apart from the fact that the people of Taiwan work pretty hard, the environment there is not always conducive to holiday making. In fact, if people want to go to a beach resort in a tiny place like Taipei, they do not need a cut lunch and a thermos of Milo to get there&mdash;they have to take at least a full day of supplies because the road system is so full that people just cannot get around the island and get to those holiday resorts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are also in the most magnificent situation of having an excess in terms of their balance of trade. They have billions and billions of dollars that are getting a bit embarrassing and they see that as one way of getting people to go overseas and to spend a few dollars. After years and years of debate about whether or not we should open up an air route to Taipei, as soon as we did&mdash;bang!&mdash;everything was full. Sure, there is some seasonality about it and, sure, this particular bill is going to give that flexibility to be able to put on those extra flights; but I am somewhat concerned that we may not have got the full advantage of that Taipei traffic. In the last 12 months or so we have not necessarily had that full flexibility available in those peak times to bring in those tremendous numbers of people who want to come to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, they are going around Asia but they have been going around Asia for some years and Australia is certainly seen as an exciting new and environmentally friendly and safe destination. The potential out of Taipei is absolutely enormous. When we look at the expenditure patterns of tourists from Taipei&mdash;forget their air fares and forget what they spend in their hotel accommodation&mdash;they are spending in excess of $200 per head per day while they are here. It is not bad if we can get 100,000-plus Taiwanese coming in here and putting that sort of money into our economy. It is not only into our retail system but into our manufacturing and rural systems as well. I often think that we do not fully recognise just what the international tourism business is all about in terms of its capacity to be able to provide wealth for Australia. Obviously, international tourism is going to be very much determined on the price of fares into Australia and the capacity of Australia to take that business. It all starts with airline services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the commission the IASC has got is going to be a very important one for the future of Australia. It is going to be a very important one for the remainder of this decade while we have this settling-down period when we find out what the new complex of international airline arrangements is all about. We want to make sure, through the IASC, that we do have the capacity for Australian carriers to be able to meet the demand and that we have no artificial inhibitions to new international carriers in Australia starting up to service some of that particular traffic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, I just say this: I think the IASC has a huge social obligation. I know that I have mentioned this in speeches for years and years but it is a fact of life. Every time we get a net increase of 25,000 international tourists coming into Australia, we create another 1,400 jobs&mdash;25,000 net increase, another 1,400 jobs. That is pretty important in terms of what we are going to provide for our kids and their kids in the future. The tourist industry is going to be a major factor in the creation of new employment in Australia. One of the things that the IASC must realise is that it has a very vital role in making sure that we can maximise that inbound tourist traffic and, by doing that, maximise future jobs for our kids. </PARA>

<PARA>The Life Insurance Bill 1994 introduces a modern regulatory framework for the life insurance industry. It represents the first major reform of the life insurance law since the then Treasurer, Ben Chifley, introduced the Life Insurance Act of 1945. That act will be superseded by this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, as in 1945, the life insurance industry makes a significant economic and social contribution to Australia. Thousands of households and businesses rely on savings and risk products sold by life companies. The life industry has assets over $115 billion and plays a key role in our financial system.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are further government amendments to these two bills which I do not intend to canvass, except to say that they have the support of industry parties, as I understand it, including the Life Insurance Federation of Australia, or LIFA. I acknowledge with thanks the information provided, presumably in a timely way, but certainly as early as I suspect was possible, by the parliamentary secretary and his office. The coalition simply has not had a chance to digest that information. No doubt it will receive the deserved detailed examination when the bills reach the Senate. However, at this stage the coalition sees no reason why it should withhold support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal act, which is almost 50 years old, simply does not meet the requirements and expectations placed on it by contemporary society. Matters such as increased prudential supervision and improved consumer protection are aspects of a modern life insurance act that these bills propose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among other things, the first of the bills which are being debated cognately&mdash;the Life Insurance Bill&mdash;will streamline the regulation of life insurance and set new solvency, capital adequacy and financial reporting requirements; increase the responsibilities of directors, auditors and actuaries; increase the powers of the insurance and superannuation commissioner; remove duplicated regulations under the Corporations Law; and establish the life insurance actuarial standards board. The bill does not contain any provisions dealing with product disclosure requirements. However, I think the parliamentary secretary said that the government will introduce amendments which will strengthen disclosure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Insurance Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) of 1994, which was debated in this place in the autumn session, made amendments to the Insurance Contracts Act 1984, to give the ISC wider powers to ensure greater disclosure about benefits and early exit penalties to potential superannuants. The government probably intends that any disclosure amendments will operate in a way similar to those clauses in the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill 1993, which amended several bills, including the Insurance Contracts Act. The Insurance Contracts Act provides for greater disclosure rules for consumer credit insurance, but it also allows for these provisions to be extended to other forms of insurance such as life insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Insurance Contracts Act provides for greater disclosure rules for consumer credit insurance, but it also allows for these provisions to be extended to other forms of insurance, such as life insurance. On reading the ISC annual report for 1993-94, it appears the ISC is planning to rely on circulars 304 and 305 to ensure that there are adequate levels of information disclosure. The ISC intends to combine this with consumer testing to further refine the disclosure rules and to come up with a number of options for the best means of disclosing total charges and commissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To ensure that companies are complying with the circulars, the ISC has been examining the industry's promotional material. As of 30 September this year, 309 customer information brochures and 39 direct response marketing packages have been examined. The ISC claims that most of the material examined shows that the life companies are adequately meeting their disclosure requirements. It was initially planned that the application of circulars 304 and 305 would be consistent with the life insurance code of practice. This code was initially supposed to be released about now, I understand, to coincide with the passage of this bill. However, the code of practice has been put on hold pending the completion of a sample test of three different disclosure options by 1,000 consumers in various industry focus groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the code comes into effect, the Life Insurance Federation of Australia, LIFA, will also examine options for the accreditation of life agents. The government has determined that accreditation will be conducted by the industry, through LIFA, as opposed to a government licensing system. The government's rejection of licensing makes sense, especially in terms of keeping costs and regulation to a minimum. It is also recognition that the life industry should be best able to develop a suitably flexible accreditation system for itself. However, I make the point that many insurance agents and brokers from whom I have received correspondence are very much in favour of licensing and/or some form of accreditation. Their reasons for favouring controls are well-founded, in that they hope to stop unqualified people from providing life insurance and superannuation advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They correctly maintain that to allow unqualified people to operate in the industry will invite shonky operators, damage the standing of the industry and have a detrimental impact on the long-term viability of the life insurance market. In the light of that, it is necessary for the ISC and LIFA to make certain, when developing the new accreditation system, that it is effective in keeping unqualified people and organisations out of the industry. However, it must also ensure that the industry does not become too restrictive, so as to knock out everyone except the life insurance agents and brokers. My understanding of the government's position is that all people&mdash;as far as practical&mdash;giving detailed financial advice will need to be accredited. Therefore, a bank financial adviser will have to be accredited, but a teller handing a superannuation or life insurance information sheet to a customer over the counter will not. That seems perfectly reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Life Insurance Bill is important, if for no other reason than that it establishes a basic regulatory framework for an industry of very considerable national importance. The life insurance companies have total assets of some $116 billion, of which $98 billion is tied up in Australian assets. This bill reflects the growing international trend to improve the reporting standards of life insurance companies. Whereas other nations are approaching this issue by means of a more gradual process, Australia is taking the fast track approach. This will be crucial in terms of speeding the rationalisation of the industry. The number of life companies has fallen in the last four years to 51, and this downward trend is expected to continue, due to the capital requirements of this bill as well as because of a shortage of capital in many of the smaller life companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the detail of the bill. The objective is to protect the interests of owners and prospective owners of life insurance policies, consistent with the continued development of a viable, competitive and innovative life insurance industry. The principal means adopted to achieve this are: restricting life insurance business to companies meeting certain requirements, including solvency and capital adequacy of statutory funds; providing for supervision by the ISC and, where necessary, judicial management; protecting policy owners' interests in the event of winding up; and providing supervision of transfers and amalgamations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 3 of the bill concerns the registration of life companies. The ISC may refuse registration only if the Treasurer agrees and if, in the case of a company limited only by shares, the company's paid-up share capital and share premium account credit is less than $10 million, or such greater amount to be fixed by subsequent regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, registration may be refused if the company's eligible assets, excluding statutory fund assets, do not exceed its total liabilities&mdash;other than liabilities in respect of share capital, or liabilities that may be met by the statutory fund&mdash;by at least $5 million, or such greater amount to be fixed by regulations; or if, in the case of a company limited by both shares and guarantee, or of a company having no share capital, the company's eligible assets, excluding statutory fund assets, are less than $10 million, or such greater amount to be fixed by regulations; or if the company is unable, or is likely to be unable, to meet its obligations&mdash;including non-life business obligations&mdash;or is unable to comply with the act; if the company has a name close to that of a registered life company, so as to be likely to deceive; or if the company carries on or proposes to carry on some other business that, in addition to life business, would not be in the public interest.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other bill before us is the Life Insurance (Consequential Amendments and Repeals) Bill. As the parliamentary secretary told us, the bill repeals law introduced in connection with the Occidental and Regal Life insurance companies, which were, at one stage, in some degree of difficulty. Ultimately, the legislation turned out to be unnecessary, as I understand it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main provisions of this bill are to amend the Life Insurance Act 1945 and various other pieces of legislation. The bill repeals the Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Levies Act 1991 and the Life Insurance Policy Holders' Protection Levies Collection Act 1991. These acts provided for the provision of levies on life insurance companies, to protect policyholders of the Occidental and Regal Life insurance companies. Subsequently, the judicial manager advised the ISC that the levies will not be required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation follows widespread disquiet with sections of the insurance industry which has existed over quite a few years, particularly amongst the ranks of consumers and of the business community. The industry had developed a questionable reputation for commission-driven sales, which suggested scant regard for the real needs of consumers. The industry has also come to be seen as being secretive and lacking accountability. There is currently little transparency in the activities of insurance companies. The level of information disclosure and financial reporting required of insurance companies is well below that required for other entities under the Corporations Law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry has seen some spectacular failures as well, such as the aborted sale of the Regal and Occidental Life companies. Many of these problems have been attributed to inadequacies in the existing legislative framework and the lack of powers for the industry regulator, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Life Insurance Act 1945 is the source of many of these inadequacies. Many of the insurance products sold today simply did not exist when the Life Insurance Act was first conceived. For example, under this act, deferred annuities, one of the most common rollover products, are not differentiated from the other annuity products. The regular reports required by the ISC under the act are, therefore, unable to determine the extent of deferred annuities, as against other annuity products. The financial reporting for the ISC under the act concentrates only on the solvency of the relevant company. There is no focus on company profitability, which means it is impossible to put a value on a life company, or to make comparisons between one company and another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also widespread uncertainty about accounting practices used by insurance companies. For example, considerable debate takes place as to how property investments are valued and about the status of loans made to agents, known as agency development loans. All income received by an insurance company is reported as revenue, regardless of its origins, so that deposits by investors into savings plans are shown as income, whereas a similar deposit at a bank would be shown as a liability. There is no required accounting standard covering the accounts of life insurance companies. I made reference earlier to a number of ISC circulars on the subject, which seek to guide industry practice, but those circulars are not binding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill now before us goes a long way to ensuring that there is greater uniformity of financial reporting in the life insurance industry. The ISC has been doing a great deal to try to establish uniform industry standards. This legislation, along with more practical publications, makes a positive contribution. By all accounts, such efforts have been undertaken in a way which ensures wide levels of consultation. The ISC is to be commended for this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increased disclosure is supported by the coalition, while the industry is now largely in support as well. Some quarters in the industry have been reluctant to embrace greater disclosure rules, but the industry now realises that the community will have more faith in it if consumers are made fully aware of what they are purchasing. It seems reasonable to suppose that, if consumers feel that they are receiving a fair deal, the industry can generate a growing market. Mr George Pooley, the ISC Commissioner, has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am confident that improved information disclosure will benefit not only consumers, but also the life insurance industry.

Some of this reluctance is due to the fact that, on both sides of this House, there is a desire for a self-regulatory environment in which the industry can be trusted with its own regulation, and in which it has a code of practice that has the confidence of the Australian community.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the areas responsible under Treasury for general and life insurance have been brought into the central body, there has been an improvement in the performance of the ISC. Although I do not believe that improvement is adequate at this point, I commend the final emergence of this type of legislation. However, I have to say that the commission must look to better techniques for servicing the industry than by trebling the levy that it imposes on the industry to cover costs. This appears to be a bureaucratic solution. Whilst the role of the commission has expanded considerably, bodies of this type look too readily to cover their responsibilities by hitting the clients they have charged. There can be no complaint from the clients because they are captive clients and would only complain in dire circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With those preliminary remarks, I turn to the particularities of the legislation. There is no doubt that the insurance industry, particularly the life insurance industry, has need for the changes I have already mentioned. For instance, the inability of clients to be able to compare products from one company to another is something that has distressed the community. In the area of life insurance and superannuation it has been almost impossible for clients&mdash;your constituents, Mr Deputy Speaker, and mine&mdash;to compare what a particular company is offering them with a similar package from another company. It appears to be a feature of the industry that insurance companies want to keep secret from their clients the exact details of what a policy holds, so that the client feels captured by that particular insurance company and unable to escape. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From an outsider's point of view, that appears to be the philosophy under which this industry operates. Openness will allow quality organisations to excel, in contrast to the situation where the organisations which are the most secretive are the ones which hold their clients. I suspect that, in future, decisions by investors and by those seeking insurance will be based on merit. I am pleased about that, and I believe that it is a good step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course under this legislation all products will come under the supervision of the ISC, and I hope that there is not a desire on the part of the ISC to control or to have a set philosophy. I believe that there should be a very open approach: provided that the descriptions are accurate, provided that there is good disclosure on the part of the company and provided that clients understand what is being done by a particular insurance company, I do not believe that the ISC should intervene and prescribe how insurance companies should package their products. The ISC has a supervisory role, but not to the extent of intervention. I do not see this act as giving it the right to intervene and to restrict the free flow of commerce and ideas. In this day and age, when there are inadequate savings by Australians, life insurance is one process whereby people can be encouraged to save. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these savings packages there needs to be a great deal of creativity and a sympathetic, inventive approach to the needs of people as their lifestyles change and as they experience different needs at particular stages of their workplace experiences. The needs of a single employee, compared with the needs of a person approaching retirement&mdash;when the issues of an estate or a family are perhaps being considered&mdash;or the needs of a widow, should be carefully considered. When designing a package for a client, the company designing the package should be allowed maximum scope for creativity and inventiveness, taking into account the needs of the client and the insurer, without interference from the ISC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just the same, there is a need for clients to understand what they are buying. Too often there is a veil of secrecy and half-truth, which is there to encourage a commitment rather than a comprehension. I want to see both comprehension and commitment on the part of the client, and not just the financial commitment which is so earnestly sought by the person making the sale for the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The upgraded solvency in capital adequacy standards proposed in this legislation is welcome. It is a critical feature and it was imposed, to some degree, by the former insurance commission. Though lacking some powers, the commission did its best to ensure that there was adequate solvency and capital arrangements for each firm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I go through some of the main features of the legislation, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) can hear that, despite my opening remarks, I am not particularly critical of the legislation. One criticism I do have of the legislation is that some of the improvements have been a little slow. The community needed protection sooner. The government need not have gone to the extent of using this big bang approach to the comprehensive changes to the legislation; a progressive approach could have been used. The government chose to put things on the backburner and then, years after the time when action was urgently required, it came up with these proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have another criticism of the ISC, or perhaps it is a word of caution. As yet, everything in the garden is not right with the ISC. I want to see a high degree of professionalism and service develop in that organisation, rather than a degree of restriction and bureaucratic control. Its relationship with the industry, traditionally through the separate commissions, has been good. That relationship ought to be retained, along with the additional elements that this legislation imposes. The start up of the ISC was one of the detrimental features of its existence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial statements that are required under this legislation will be more comprehensive and meaningful to policyholders. It is about time this occurred, as reporting procedures have not been accurate. Proper reporting processes are already required of all public companies, but my mind goes back to failures and fraud in this industry. The government has corrected the inadequate reporting procedures in the general insurance industry, and we now have a follow-through with life insurance. It is absolutely proper this should occur. Life insurers need to let their policyholders know exactly where they are putting their money and what the yield is on the policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To some degree, the insurance industry, whether it be superannuation, life or general insurance, has been governed by a regime of secrecy, Its attitude has been, `We will not tell you where we have got our dough and we will not tell you what you are going to get at the end of the day. Trust us.' That is not good enough in a society where people do require accurate information, do need to make good decisions and do require, in the early days of their investing life, adequate information in order to make a decision that, in the case of insurance, is a long-term decision. They do not want to get part way through a policy only to find that it is a lemon and that it is difficult to bail out. Things have to be up-front and open, competitive and trustworthy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The standards board is a good device and one that I applaud. Again, I applaud increased responsibilities for directors. They have to be able to accept that the buck stops with them and they have to be able to stand up at public meetings, at meetings of members&mdash;in the case of mutual societies&mdash;or meetings of shareholders, and justify their position. I have no problems with that whatsoever. A fiduciary duty to policyholders, or to members, is part of the current regime and should be applauded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ISC has additional powers and resources. It can issue legally enforceable rules to life companies. It can approve investigations and initiate judicial management processes. I hope that this is a threat, rather than something that is going to be activated, because I do not want to see interference with this industry. It has been a pretty good industry and it has contributed a lot to Australia. All that we need to do is to have a measure of control, held in reserve by the ISC, so that companies are aware that it can act if necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Too much restriction and control will dampen this industry, even though I would be the first to admit that this legislation is necessary. The opposition certainly does endorse this legislation. The government is correct and we have little to contribute, except that we hope that the government gets on with a proper campaign throughout Australia to devise a comprehensive savings policy, instead of piecemeal legislation. I have said that to the parliamentary secretary on other occasions. I mean it and I will keep on saying it until the government truly develops policies that will encourage Australians to save. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak on the Life Insurance Bill, I do so as a person who, for some years, had an insurance agency. It was a business that I enjoyed very much. It was a very rewarding business to be involved in. I am quite amazed at what is happening in the insurance industry today: where there were some 18,000 insurance representatives throughout Australia, there is now around half of that figure. To some degree, one reason for the fall in numbers is the superannuation issue. But there is also the fact that disclosure has forced the insurance companies to rearrange their management structures. When I had an AMP agency in Mount Isa, we had 17 agents. There are now only two agents working out of that office. That situation has occurred right across Australia. Undoubtedly, there were some agents that the industry would have been a lot better off without, and presumably a number of those people have, please God, left.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is happening now is that the amount of money paid to the agents has been reduced dramatically. The net result of that is that these people cannot cover costs, they cannot stay alive in the industry, so they lose the industry. There is now no-one out there to service the industry. If a person has a query or a problem there is nobody to ring up and no-one to ask about it. There has not been an insurance agent servicing the area that I had, the mid-west region, in any real sense in recent years. Whilst it may be argued that some of the payments were excessive to some degree, it can also be argued that there is no-one servicing the client, and that situation is going to get worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a lot of people in jobs, particularly in country areas&mdash;fencing contractors, shearers, windmill experts, mechanics, builders&mdash;who work on jobs and move on. They have to chase the work whenever it comes, and they have to switch jobs a hell of a lot. That is also true in the mining industry. The net result of it is these people do not keep books, they do not know where they were, and their superannuation entitlements are so small that they will vanish and be eaten up by administrative charges. Also, they will have enormous difficulty in simply tracking down where superannuation amounts were set aside for them. I have already had numerous cases&mdash;as I think most members of parliament have&mdash;of people complaining that they are going to lose the superannuation payments that have been taken out because they changed their place of work on a regular basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst some of these changes needed to have been made, there has been a massive overkill and the whole infrastructure of the insurance industry throughout Australia has been damaged. As with most things, the problems are felt far more in the sparsely populated country areas where our servicing costs of driving from town to town are so much higher. So we have felt the problem a lot more than other areas of Australia and will be suffering far more than other parts of Australia. The problem is not, by any stretch of the imagination, confined to the country areas; the problem exists right across the board. It is important that these things be put on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a minister for some six years of my life, I always had a policy `If it's not broken, don't fix it.' There are a million things out there that are broken. In the 1960s and 1970s this industry was working marvellously well. In return for tax deductibility some 50 per cent&mdash;it might have been 20 per cent, I do not recall the figure&mdash;of all the money that was put into life insurance companies was taken and put into government securities. This was a good idea in so far as it secured the assets of people who needed to know that there would be money waiting for them when they reached the end of their working life&mdash;their retirement fund. By putting money into government securities they had gilt-edged security because the money went into government loans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That money then became available to the government to farm out into development projects and special help funds&mdash;the agricultural banks, the rural reconstruction boards, the Commonwealth Development Bank, the Australian Industry Development Corporation. All of these funds were used to create the Holden motor car. To this very day one of our biggest employers in Australia is the motor vehicle industry, which was commenced partially from funds from the insurance sector of the economy, via the government back to the General Motors-Holden company. That money was then utilised to create an enormous development in this country, which was the building of motor cars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, those funds were used to build the mighty Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority project. It is an asset of untold wealth to Australia. The honourable whip of the National Party is here today and he would be able to say that we had a little tiny town out there called Griffith, we had a little tiny town out there called Deniliquin, and they are great inland cities today. The wealth created by the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority came from the moneys invested in life insurance. This was a sensible, coherent scheme. It was a similar scheme to ones which enabled the enormous growth of countries like Singapore, for example, where the superannuation funds have been cycled into development areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The old model was an enormously successful model. Someone had the bright idea that things were going to be better, and for the last 20 years in Australia it is hard to point to a single development that has taken place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would exclude Queensland from that because of the coalmining and tourism industries there. We applied that principle on a state basis. We took moneys that were invested in Suncorp; those moneys were then cycled out to develop the coalmining industry. Twenty-five years ago we exported no coal at all from Queensland. This year we will export close to $4,000 million worth of coal. Also, the tourism industry did not exist much at all in Queensland 25 years ago. I think we had one five-star hotel in Queensland 15 years ago; we now have probably 30 or 40 five-star hotels in the state. Those things were financed&mdash;I will not go into the detail&mdash;by the same sort of mechanism as I am advocating today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a problem that the industry is not being serviced. I am not saying that the situation used to be perfect. It was far from perfect. Agents got paid on selling and they did not get paid for servicing accounts. So in a lot of cases they did not service them. In particular, a large portion of the industry was short-term people who would come in for only a couple of years, flog what they could and take off again from the industry. The vast bulk of the agents did not fit into that category&mdash;they did service their clients and service them very well. My agent, John Dunn, in Charters Towers, provides an excellent example of the enormous detail, time and effort that such a family puts into servicing clients. They are people who have been in it for two generations. They regard it as their profession and they adopt a professional approach to it. But their margins are getting so slim that I wonder whether they will continue in the industry. They are bright, intelligent people and they can go elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry, as it is now structured, is not being serviced. Because it is not being serviced, people are not making any effort to look after their risks with insurance against the risk to their life or against any accidents that may occur along the way, insurance for their retirement or even just their home contents insurance. Those things are not being done out there because people simply do not have offices to go to where they can find out how to invest in life insurance and retirement insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sure, superannuation may look after the bulk of people, but there is still another 10 or 20 per cent out there in industries such as the banana industry, where people regularly change their place of employment and regularly work for only short periods of time. There are the 100,000 or maybe 150,000 fruit-pickers of Australia. They are a very big segment of the Australian economy. Those people often work in the north for part of the mango picking season and move south for a season picking some other fruit. They work for short periods of time at various places and, by the nature of the industry, nothing is being put aside for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, in the building industry the transportable life insurance was one of the most important factors. If we can do it with taxation numbers and those sorts of things, I am quite sure we can do it in the superannuation industry. `Portability' is one of the terms used. If a worker picking fruit at Griffith or Deniliquin puts $100 into superannuation or it is put in by his employer because of legislation, when he moves to North Queensland he simply puts his name down and future amounts go into the one account and keep building up over a long period of time, as opposed to the present situation where the amount is building down for these people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue, without reiterating, is the old arrangement where the money that was saved to look after people in their old age was put into very useful development projects. Not only did it give the government a vast sum of money to be able to inject into projects like the Holden motor car, the motor vehicle industry in Australia and the Snowy Mountains authority, it also gave people security. They had government security over the money that they were investing. This was the second side of the coin and it is being done throughout Asia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, on the issue of fire and general insurance, there was rather a good cartoon in one of the major dailies recently. It had a picture of a man walking backwards and falling down a manhole and it said, `Strangely enough, that is something that is covered by your insurance policy.' We have a continual stream&mdash;and this was particularly true when I was a state member of parliament&mdash;of people coming through the door. They take out an insurance policy but no matter what happens to their house or car it is not covered because they have all these little out clauses in them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One case that leaps to mind was on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS>, the biggest newspaper in Queensland, or the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Truth</EMPHASIS>, once the newspaper with the biggest circulation in the state. It concerned a family who had their house burnt down. The insurance company, and I do not hesitate to name it as I did in the House at the time, was MLC Insurance. The house was insured. The woman went along to insure it for $10,000. The rep said, `No, the minimum is $15,000, but if it gets burnt down you will get $15,000.' There were three witnesses to the MLC rep making that statement. The house burnt down and she did not get the $15,000 that she was told that she would get; she did not get the $10,000 that she went along to insure the house for; she did not get the $7,000 that she had paid for the house; she got a figure of $2,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company said that its assessor said that the house was worth this amount. I do not know how he figured that out because he lived in Townsville and the house burnt down in Pentland. We produced two similar houses with affidavits saying that these houses were identical. They had been purchased for $15,000 and this house had had $5,000 spent upon it. We were able to prove that with builders. The company still refused to pay. There was a sad sequel to this but it cost the company three per cent of its sales in Queensland, I am very pleased to say, for the next four months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I am not happy about the aspect I am going to relate, of course. The husband was a drunk, an alcoholic. He had rehabilitated himself and got a job and he dropped his bundle completely. His family were living under a tree in a caravan and he went back on the grog and started belting his wife up. A number of us discussed it and the police discussed it and it was decided that the best thing was to put him into a mental home for a little while until he cooled off. This was to protect his wife and to try to rehabilitate him again. He jumped the fence from the mental hospital and cut his wife's throat from ear to ear. Five little children were left with no mother and no father. That was really a reasonably happy family four months before this ugly event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I tell the story to indicate the callousness, the viciousness, the criminal irresponsibility of some companies. I do not hesitate to name MLC Insurance and to name that issue. I spoke to the chairman of the board and the general manager on four occasions. I would not say that they were particularly bright. To have left that case there the way they did and to have refused to do anything about it, I thought were fairly foolish sorts of things for them to do. That is not going to bring that lovely woman back to life and it is not going to rehabilitate the husband either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I use that extreme case to illustrate what is happening out there. There is supposed to be a watchdog over these companies; the watchdog is a farce. The person who is taking money for doing that job should be ashamed of himself and should send the cheque back to the taxpayers of Australia. I rang him on six occasions over that particular incident and I think there were something like 30 or 40 similar cases, all fully documented. In that case, we had two statements from the state Valuer-General's department saying that houses identical to this house had been sold for $15,000, so we knew the house was worth $15,000. The cost of land in that town was $1,000 a block. So we could prove completely that this person was entitled to that amount of money. I am being unfair to the company&mdash;it did raise the offer from $2,500 to $3,500 on account of the pressure that we put upon it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contracts are farcical and useless. There was no-one working in the insurance industry then&mdash;and there is no-one working in that industry now&mdash;who would not have loved a standard statutory contract. As depicted in a cartoon in a national daily, the only thing a person is covered for is walking backwards and falling down a manhole on a Saturday! We need some sort of standard form contract to be put out into the marketplace. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I want to make a few remarks in response to a range of issues that were covered in the debate. The member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), in particular, gave a very positive speech about the importance of this change to the life insurance industry. Obviously, after 50 years, a new act is going to mean significant change and challenge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In developing the new act, we have tried very hard to get the balance right and ensure that we have a modern, contemporary and complete supervisory regime for the life insurance industry. We have also tried very hard to ensure that it is done in a way which is built on the process of proper transparency in terms of the arrangements that companies have to provide. Firstly, there has to be proper accountability and a better understanding within companies of their obligations and responsibilities, given the range of new products that come on line. Secondly, the regulator has to be well-informed, and in a position to play the proper role of a regulator in the industry and maintain the confidence that proper prudential standards require. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Curtin also talked about some issues that are not directly related to this bill: the process that was followed to develop the accreditation arrangements, the disclosure regime and the consumer issues attached to those. Again, the important thing we are trying to ensure there is that we adopt a model that has the industry, and all those people involved in aspects of the industry, working in concert with us, but recognising the additional responsibilities and the demands that are there at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) referred to the time taken to develop the legislation. The matter certainly has been discussed over a significant period. Rather than make that a debating point, the key thing is that this package represents historic change. It has the support of the industry and a recognition that it needs to modernise. I think that is important in the regulatory framework. It certainly has not been adopted on a model of wanting to have overregulation or restrictive arrangements, but has been developed with contemporary needs in mind and having regard to the range of reports that have been prepared and presented in the past about the life insurance industry and the need to modernise in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of those things are highlighted by one or two of the comments made by the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter). Again, in many respects, the comments did not actually relate to this bill, but I guess that is not particularly unusual. Nevertheless, we are concerned about ensuring that we do have a model where the regulatory regime is sufficiently comprehensive to give the industry and the community the confidence they need to have in a key industry such as the life insurance industry. At the same time, it is not overregulatory and overrestrictive of the capacity to develop new products, innovations and the things that the member for Mitchell was concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that in recent years the number of life insurance agents has reduced and the relationship between life agents and life offices has changed. I think most people believe that that was a necessary change in terms of accountability and transparency, particularly if we look at what consumers generally say about that relationship. Consumers are looking for better service and better advice, more follow-up than had been the case in the past for the products they were sold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of those changes were fundamentally overdue. We seem to be getting it from both ends a bit in terms of the criticisms. Nevertheless I think what we have here, with the provisions that are in this bill and the amendments we are proposing following further consultations with the industry, and with the package of consumer measures that will flow on early next year and be presented to the parliament for consideration at that time, is a package which means the life insurance industry, along with the comprehensive superannuation provisions that have been previously adopted by the parliament, will ensure we can have confidence in that process. Certainly it will ensure that the Insurance and Superannuation Commission has the proper powers to do its job effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the comments that the member for Mitchell made, both here and in relation to other pieces of legislation on superannuation, there has not been massive growth in the number of officers that the commission has to undertake these roles. The commission has not worked on the basis of needing armies of flying squads of people out there in all of the industry; rather, it has been about getting the balance right, of placing more onus and accountability on the companies as far as the prudential standards are required and about having a proper audit process that can ensure the ongoing confidence in that regulatory regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know from your role in some of these issues, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, you would appreciate the importance of these sorts of provisions. With those thoughts in mind I commend the bill, along with the amendments we will come to in the consideraton in detail stage, to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA>The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 will amend six acts coming within the Attorney-General's portfolio. The bill contains amendments of a minor policy nature and makes minor technical amendments to existing legislation. They are explained in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the bill. The proposed amendments will not have any significant financial impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Crimes Act 1914 will correct a defect in the recently enacted Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Act 1994 which is due to commence on 1 December 1994.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As members may remember&mdash;and I am sure each and every member here will remember it very well&mdash;that act amends the Crimes Act 1914 to provide the Australian Federal Police and members of state and territory police forces with a range of investigative powers in relation to offences against commonwealth laws. Those powers are either conferred directly on constables or require a court order to authorise the exercise of the power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of the provisions in the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Act 1994 confer on a court powers which appear to be neither judicial in nature nor incidental to judicial power. I am advised that it is likely that a court might construe the exercise of these powers as being in breach of the separation of powers required by the constitution. This, in effect, would prevent courts exercising Commonwealth jurisdiction from using these powers. The amendments will ensure that the powers in question are conferred on magistrates acting in a personal capacity. The High Court has held that judicial officers, exercising federal jurisdiction and acting in a personal capacity may exercise non-judicial powers without breaching the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments are uncontroversial. They will not add to or remove powers currently conferred on law enforcement agencies or the courts. Nor will they change any of the procedural safeguards governing the exercise of those powers. Rather they merely ensure that the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Act 1994 will function as parliament intended it would. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment to the Law Officers Act 1964 will allow the Governor-General to appoint a person to act as Solicitor-General during all periods in which the Solicitor-General is absent from duty or from Australia or is, for any other reason, unable to perform the duties of a Solicitor-General. This will allow a person to be given an appointment for a fixed term during which that person would automatically act as Solicitor-General during any vacancy or absences of the Solicitor-General without the need for an appointment by the Governor-General each time that the Solicitor-General is absent from duty. Mr Dennis Rose QC has been appointed to act as Solicitor-General from 7 November 1994. The bill will ensure that Mr Rose's appointment will continue to be effective after the commencement of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will amend parts 5 and 7 of the Service and Execution of Process Act 1992 in relation to the enforcement of warrants. Part 5 of the act provides for interstate execution of a warrant (other than one for the non-payment of a lower court fine) issued under the law of a state. There is a possibility that, if a person arrested under an interstate warrant is released or remanded on bail by a magistrate and subsequently goes to another state, he or she might be invalidly re-arrested under the warrant in that state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Service and Execution of Process Act 1992 will be amended to provide that, where the arrested person has been so released or remanded, the court, authority or tribunal that issued the warrant must be notified of the release or remand; and that the issuing court, authority or tribunal must notify the police force of each other state which had been notified of the issue of the warrant of the consequences, under the act, of the person's being released or remanded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 7 of the act provides for interstate execution of warrants issued under state law for the non-payment of a lower court fine. It is considered that, unlike warrants under part 5, there is very little benefit in having warrants capable of being executed in more than one state. Accordingly, rather than provide for a notification procedure under part 7 of the act, the bill will amend the act to provide that a warrant under part 7 must be directed to police in one particular state or territory. In addition, the bill will strengthen the existing provision for withdrawal of a part 7 warrant once a person's liability to pay a fine has been discharged. The bill will also clarify the provisions of the act in relation to interstate service of process at an address for service in proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments to the Trade Practices Act 1974 will increase the penalties for breaches of the product safety and information provisions of the act to bring them into line with penalties for breaches of the consumer protection provisions of the act which came into force in January 1993; allow the use of penalty infringement notices as an alternative to prosecution for failure to notify the minister of a voluntary recall of unsafe goods; bring the procedure for effecting entry to premises under a warrant issued under section 65Q(5) of the act into line with Commonwealth criminal law policy; and allow the secretary to the department responsible for the enforcement of the product safety and information provisions of the act to accept and apply to the court to enforce written undertakings in connection with matters in which he or she has powers or functions under the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also make a number of minor amendments, including removing gender-specific language, to the Copyright Act 1968. Items 14 and 31 of schedule 2 will make changes to sections 38 and 103 of the Copyright Act respectively, to correct an error that was introduced into the Copyright Act by the Copyright Amendment Act 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a matter of fairness retrospective amendments should not adversely affect persons who have had their rights adjudicated or who specifically relied on the law in acting as they did. To ensure that result clause 7 of the bill provides that judicial decisions made on the basis of the wording of the existing provisions are not affected by the retrospective amendment. Also protected are actions of persons in reliance on these provisions as they were after the commencement of the Copyright Amendment Act 1991 and before the commencement of clause 7 of this act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also remove gender-specific language from the Judiciary Act 1903 and the Law Officers Act 1964. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 was introduced into the Senate and amends a number of statutes, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan) has pointed out. The coalition does not oppose the bill. I propose to comment on only two aspects of the bill: firstly the provisions relating to the Law Officers Act, and then the provisions relating to the Trade Practices Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Law Officers Act will allow the Governor-General to appoint a person to act as Solicitor-General during a vacancy in the office of Solicitor-General, or in circumstances where the Solicitor-General is unable to perform the functions of the office. This will allow a person to be given an appointment for a fixed term during which that person would automatically act as Solicitor-General each time the Solicitor-General was absent from duty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has in recent times been something of a change in the role of the Solicitor-General which I think warrants comment. I thought I might be able to ascertain some information relating to the functions of the Solicitor-General from the annual report of the Attorney-General's Department. Under the Law Officers Act 1964 the Solicitor-General, as an officer, is not required to file an annual report. In the annual report of the Attorney-General's Department there appear to be only two mentions of the Solicitor-General. One is in respect of financial information, where it is indicated that the outlays in 1993-1994 were something over $600,000. The other mention is in the appendices, where the functional statements for the Attorney-General's Department and some portfolio agencies are set out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Attorney-General's Department's report there is no provision of any information at all on what the Solicitor-General has done. I find this rather unusual, and the absence of information is made all the more striking because in the report of the department, and specifically in the part of the report relating to legal services to the Commonwealth, there is extensive reference to the role of the Chief General Counsel and the Office of General Counsel. There we find that the Chief General Counsel, Mr Dennis Rose, QC, has provided high level specialist advice and advocacy services, including making a considerable number of appearances in the High Court representing the Commonwealth. Whether that is on account of the demands on the Solicitor-General or for other reasons is not apparent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the functional statements I observe that the Solicitor-General's functions are described in terms which are compatible with the functions of the office set out in the Law Officers Act. Under the heading `Categories of documents' it is indicated that `the Solicitor-General maintains the following categories of documents', and then there are listed certain papers relating to litigious and non-litigious matters, certain matters relating to the Special Committee of Solicitors-General, and a third and fourth item. The fourth one is a miscellaneous item, but the third one is `correspondence, reports and minutes relating to multilateral international organisations'. I find that a bit puzzling. There is the International Court of Justice, and one would anticipate the Solicitor-General would represent the Commonwealth as counsel before that organisation. There are, no doubt, international arbitrations where the Solicitor-General would be expected to act as counsel. But the maintenance of files relating to multilateral international organisations, so broadly defined, seems not to be completely consistent with the role of the Solicitor-General as counsel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be that it is appropriate, in light of the role of the Chief General Counsel and the officers under him, that there be an examination of the role of the Solicitor-General, or at least an examination of what the Solicitor-General does, with a view to determining whether an annual report by the Solicitor-General is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the Solicitor-General spends a great deal of time overseas. It may be that the functions of the Solicitor-General are beyond the capacity of one person to perform, in the ordinary sort of way, as they have traditionally been performed. But, in the absence of almost any information at all in the form of an annual report, it is simply impossible to make a comment on that question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Service and Execution of Process Act 1992 are to clarify procedures with regard to the notification and withdrawal of warrants and for the service of process generally. I do not propose to comment on them. The amendments to the Crimes Act are as indicated by the parliamentary secretary in his second reading speech and I do not propose to comment on them. The amendments to the Copyright Act and the Judiciary Act are in relation to language only. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments that caused most concern in the Senate related to the Trade Practices Act and they have since been withdrawn by the government. The amendments sought, among other things, to clarify the powers of entry of officers to premises without warrant to inspect unsafe goods. This aspect of the bill was the focus of attention by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, to which the bill was referred in September 1994. The committee examined the bill and reported in October 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the committee's public hearing, the committee explored three legal policy issues that arose under the proposed Trade Practices Act amendments. These were the desirability of conferring powers of entry on authorised officers of the Trade Practices Commission, the justification for the proposed increase in penalties for non-compliance with requests for information and documents, and privacy issues which may arise in the exercise of the entry powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill does not bestow the powers of warrantless entry to premises on officers of the Trade Practices Commission. These powers are provided under the Trade Practices Act itself. The act confers upon the minister, or authorised officers, the power to obtain information, documents and evidence from a supplier relating to goods which will or may cause injury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act provides that an authorised officer may enter any premises from which a corporation supplies goods to inspect the goods where he or she has reason to believe that goods of a particular kind may be injurious. The act requires that the power of entry only be exercised where `The exercise of those powers is required without delay in order to protect life or public safety,' or pursuant to a warrant issued under the section. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the amendments to this bill that are now proposed by the government, the part of the bill that was to deal with these entry powers has now been dropped. For this reason, I will not comment further on the proposal in the bill to amend the act to clarify these entry powers, other than to welcome the dropping by the government of the relevant part of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to offer some comments generally on the quasi-police powers given to the officers of the commission under the act.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his evidence to the committee's public hearing, the Secretary-General of the Australian Federal Police Association, Mr Patrick Law, pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Police officers not only undergo rigorous training in respect of the execution of search warrants but also operate under stringent accountability guidelines. The conduct of police can not only be tested by the courts but by the force's own internal investigation units.</PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst the Association can appreciate the need for legislation to provide for authorised officers with the legislative ability to protect the safety of a person, or to ensure a warrant is not frustrated, it wishes to bring to the attention of the committee the potential problems of extending police powers to non-police. These quasi-investigative organisations do not have the accountability of police agencies and it is this deficiency that exposes those persons working for that organisation to potential danger both civilly and criminally.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Association asserts that those authorised persons or persons assisting them should not be placed in those circumstances which require immediate action to protect life or evidence. This is clearly a police function.</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs pointed out in response that authorised officers were accountable under the general provisions which apply to public servants, such as the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act, and Public Service regulations, and that they could be the subject of a complaint to the Ombudsman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the conclusion to its report, the Senate committee stressed that the concerns raised during the public hearing about the extension of certain powers of entry to authorised officers of the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs and the Trade Practices Commission relate to the existing legislation and not to the now dropped proposed amendments. This is of concern, because it means that the offending provisions remain in the legislation. The committee went on to say in its conclusion that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The powers of warrantless search are intrusive. There is much to be said for the AFP performing these types of functions.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee then went on to list the reasons that justify the present arrangement and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee records its ongoing interest in scrutinising the issue of the conferring of police type powers on agencies other than police forces. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Certainly it is a matter which should be carefully considered and justified before the practice is extended further. There is also scope to give further detailed consideration to how the powers are to be exercised, how the relevant officials are to be trained and to the appropriate complaint mechanisms which should apply were things to go wrong in the exercise of these extraordinary functions and powers. The committee is of the view that it would be appropriate for the government to review the need for maintaining the provisions in the Trade Practices Act for warrantless searches. The Attorney-General's department has suggested that, with modern communications, the power to get telephone warrants almost replaces the need for warrantless emergency searches.</PARA>
<PARA>As I indicated, the committee effectively endorsed the bill, subject to the removal of provisions which are no longer pursued. The committee therefore, in effect, unanimously endorsed the bill in its present form. The coalition does not oppose the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note that the opposition is supporting the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), and that it is an omnibus bill from the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch). Whilst I want to make specific remarks about some of the proposed changes, I do want to also deal with wider issues of law reform, which I know have a high priority amongst the portfolio ministers from this area. I am sure that these issues are also of concern to opposition members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed bill makes a number of important amendments to the Trade Practices Act, some of which were discussed by the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams). It provides for increased penalties for breaches of product safety and information provisions of the Trade Practices Act. It includes a power to make regulations to allow the use of penalty infringement notices, as an alternative to prosecutions, for failure to notify the minister of a voluntary recall of unsafe goods. It brings the procedure for effecting entry into premises, under a warrant issued under section 65(q)(5) of the Trade Practices Act, into line with the Commonwealth criminal law policy. Under this bill, the secretary to the department responsible for the enforcement of the product safety and information provisions of the Trade Practices Act has the power to accept and apply to the court, in order to enforce written undertakings in connection with a matter in which he or she has powers or functions under the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know it will come as no surprise that many constituents are very interested in this whole area of product warranty and the role of the Trade Practices Act as far as products and services are concerned. The government is committed to ensuring that the Trade Practices Act is up to date and meets community needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a second focus to the Trade Practices Act which relates to the protection of consumers. The changes proposed under the bill will give weight to the enforcement of compliance with safety measures under the act. The Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Act 1992, which came into force last year, increased the pecuniary penalties for breaches of the consumer protection provisions of part IV of the Trade Practices Act to $40,000 for individuals and $200,000 for corporations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there are various provisions in division 1A of that part to which these pecuniary penalties do not apply and which were not increased in line with the rest of part V. The current amendments will increase penalties for certain offences under division 1A. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the very important features of this bill is that section 87B of the Trade Practices Act gives power to the secretary to the department responsible for the enforcement of product safety and information provisions of the Trade Practices Act to accept written undertakings from a person in relation to the powers or functions under the Trade Practices Act. If the undertaking is breached, the authority may apply to the court for appropriate orders, including directing compliance with the undertaking, directing the payment of the financial benefit obtained and directing compensation for any person who has suffered a loss or damage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Trade Practices Act is being amended to give the secretary to the department responsible for the enforcement of certain provisions the same power to accept and to apply to the court to enforce written undertakings in connection with matters in relation to which he or she has powers or functions under the Trade Practices Act. Product safety is very important and measures available to enforce consumer safety need to be effective and to reflect the current environment. I strongly endorse those changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said I wanted to talk about law reform. It strikes me that within both political parties we have seen the rise of the supremacy of economics, if not economic rationalists. I wonder, in contemplating the measures that we need to provide citizens so they are able to exercise their legal rights, whether it is appropriate to use tools or disciplines to judge the law&mdash;things like micro-economic reform, removing demarcation disputes, or increasing productivity and multi-skilling, to name a couple. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting thing about law reform is that we can measure certain things. If we wanted to, we could get a good measure of unsatisfied demand, that is, people who are unable to obtain funding from legal aid or have their own funds to pursue a legal right. What is the level of un-met demand? I say to the Attorney-General that a very useful statistic to have would be what it costs. We can get what it costs to run the various courts, but how much does that constitute of our GDP? What are the total dollars? I do not know that there has been too much work done there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some work done in terms of those client services, that is, looking at the roles of solicitors and barristers. It may be said that the proponents of fusion are really eradicating demarcation disputes. Is that really going far enough? Are we sufficiently utilising paraprofessionals? An example of a different way of thinking is perhaps in conveyancing where, in some states now, non-legal people are able to operate, if they are registered.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Duncan" NAMEID="7G4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QI4">Mr PRICE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since 1860, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General points out, in South Australia. This has a significant impact on affordability. The other thing is that, if one advocates the use of paraprofessionals, one has to ask whether we are sufficiently utilising expert systems in the law, which would be of great advantage. In other words, does a highly qualified solicitor or a highly qualified barrister in every case have to validate advice given to citizens seeking to have answers to legal questions? I suspect the answer is no. What I am trying to suggest is that if we are thinking only in terms of demarcation, if we are thinking only in terms of multiskilling, fusion is not the total answer. It is a welcome answer, but not the total answer, just as the provision of competition amongst barristers and solicitors is welcome, but not the total answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then turn to the court systems where legal matters are adjudicated. A few things strike me. For example, it is always going to be very necessary to have eminent and highly qualified judges in our courts, but is it necessary to establish each judicial official with a law library? Does the Attorney-General disclose about every court and about every quasi-court&mdash;for example, the Industrial Relations Court&mdash;whether people being appointed to these positions are entitled to a law library? What is the cost of providing them with a law library? Are the libraries in their buildings insufficient to meet their needs? Has any judge ever knocked one back?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to ask a simple question from the point of view of a working-class member of this parliament. Why is it that judges do not contribute to their own superannuation? How many others in society do not contribute to their own superannuation? What is so special about judges that they do not contribute to their own superannuation? Probably there is a very good historical reason why that may have been so in the past, but I suspect that in our modern day and age this is not a community standard that members of the public would readily accept. In fact, I think it is just like the personal law libraries: members of the public do not know about the fact that judges pay no super. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, Mr Deputy Speaker, you come to the issue of staffing. Does every judge really need to have associates, tipstaffs and the use of drivers? Would the quality of the decision making they are involved in, in the 1990s and in the year 2000, be compromised by a lesser staff overhead?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I have already commented in an earlier debate that we seem to have a predilection for constructing the grandest of buildings&mdash;perhaps, some may say, a touch of hypocrisy for someone standing in this new Parliament House. Let us have the High Court as a grand building&mdash;I do not demur there&mdash;but does every other federal courthouse in the land have to be so ornate? Again, is it the luxury of the buildings that contributes to the quality of the decision making? I think not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the overseas budget for travel for judges? I do not want to deny the opportunity for learned judges to travel overseas, but how many conferences a year do they need to attend? And is there a minimum number they need to attend every year? Again, given that this money is coming from the public purse&mdash;given that this is a legal overhead&mdash;can it be argued that these trips are justified. I would be very interested to learn the answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I mention this issue of multiskilling and demarcation. We have registrars in our judicial system, and we have a lower court system as well. Are we satisfied that we have the proper breakdown? I will give an example which shows how attitudes to professionals change. I came from the PMG and Telecom. In those organisations we virtually had to have an engineer in every significant management position, until we realised that engineers were a precious professional resource. We realised that we needed to have managers managing, and that we should only utilise engineers in their professional expertise. I pose the same questions: no-one would argue that we need to eliminate judges, but does every function they perform need to be performed by them? Could some functions be devolved to registrars or, indeed, could lower courts, such as the magistrates courts, take on a greater workload?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect that I will dwell on is the aspect of tribunals. In seeking to reform the law, it is very important that we do not take away people's legal rights. They must always be preserved. We have seen the growth of things like small claims tribunals and many are now advocating alternate dispute mechanisms. Every citizen should have the right to go into court, notwithstanding that people can choose to go through some other process, to exercise his or her legal rights. However, are we satisfied that all those matters that go before magistrates, registrars, or even judges under our federal jurisdiction, need to be there in the first instance? Are there other appropriate forums in which we may be able to conciliate decisions, if not arbitrate the balance of those decisions. We would thus avoid people incurring the expense of going to a magistrates court, or the expense of going into a higher level court. There is much to be commended in this approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will finish on the point on which I started. There is a long haul to go in terms of law reform. I commend the portfolio ministers. I know that they are significantly committed to further law reform. Indeed, I know that the opposition is so committed. However, we may have to use some of the more radical approaches that we have used in other areas, approaches which preserve the quality of output, and which increase productivity. At the end of the day, we are going to move away from the myth that people have legal rights, that is, if a person is unable to exercise a legal right, that person has no right at all. There needs to be a change from the myth of a legal right to the reality of a legal right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a long way to go. Much of the law has priced itself out of reach of not only the battlers whom I am proud to represent, but also the middle class. Some people would argue that the law really is the preserve of the seriously wealthy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The law has provided a lot of safeguards for the community, and for ordinary people. Lawyers speak with great respect about the role of the law. I understand and appreciate that. In facing the next century it is important that the law adapts to modern needs and demands which are increasing rather than decreasing. Unless this is done, the law seriously runs the risk of becoming totally irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, I support these bills. Again, I note that the opposition is supporting this omnibus bill. I look forward to learning of the progress that this government is undertaking in law reform. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I am pleased to sum up the debate briefly. I respond to a couple of points only. The honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) raised some issues in relation to the amendments to the law officers legislation. I say to him that his comments have been noted and placed on the record and I can assure him that they will be given serious consideration. In relation to the Solicitor-General specifically, can I simply put on the record the fact that the Solicitor-General is not under the administrative control of the Attorney-General's Department. He is a statutory independent officer and so some of the issues that he has raised, whilst they may be of more than passing interest, are not matters which are within the administrative purview of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the comments of the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), I was fascinated to listen to some of the suggestions he made. I am sure that on reading the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> report of his comments others will reach for the smelling salts. The only thing I would like to say to him is in relation to his raising of the question as to why judges receive non-contributory superannuation. I can remember the comments of a former Prime Minister who said that it was an inducement to try to lower the number of lawyers in the parliaments. True or otherwise, I do not know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One aspect of his contribution I comment on is the question of the extent to which libraries are needed for particular judges. I simply say to him that these days I think a more apt question would be whether computers should be provided and, more importantly, whether re-education schools for potential judicial appointees should not be introduced to ensure that each and every one of the persons appointed to benches in the future is computer literate. That is a tool which, to a tremendous extent, makes a court and a judge a much more efficient facility and person.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity to comment on the recent report tabled by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working with the environment: opportunities for job growth</EMPHASIS>. A number of issues readily come to mind where employment opportunities can be created in the environment area. The first one that I mention is the section which relates to policies for sustainable employment growth in the use of less polluting energy sources.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of opportunities in this area can be utilised. In my own electorate recently an energy program has been developed using co-generation where steam has been used to produce electrical energy. The steam was first created to provide steam for a commercial laundry. That laundry had an excess capacity of steam which was able to be used in the production of electricity. It has generated sufficient power and energy for its own use at the Anne Caudle Centre in Bendigo and it even has an excess capacity which it is producing and putting into the SEC grid network which can be utilised by other users. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another employment opportunity has been created with the development of co-generation plants, quite a high-tech operation which will require a high level of skills. It is an opportunity that should be developed as it will create some real jobs, not the temporary type jobs that this government is putting forward under its present policies. There is also an opportunity for the development of small hydro-electricity plants. There are a number of streams in Victoria and throughout Australia that could be utilised to produce small hydro plants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been found that smaller hydro plants can be effective. Whilst not being utilised at the point of generation, they can be fed into the grid network, and the power can be taken from the network at the source of the requirement and used. Once again, we are talking about the development of smaller hydro-electricity generating plants which will require a great degree of skill and technical expertise. Of course, these are the sorts of jobs that we are looking for throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area that I want to touch on, and which was not mentioned in the report&mdash;I did look through it to see whether I could find any mention of it&mdash;is the management of the demand of electrical energy in Australia. Demand management is an area that is overlooked. In fact, one of the first questions that I asked when I came to this new Parliament House was about the energy consumed in this building each year. Looking at all of the power consumed in this place&mdash;the air conditioning, the lighting, the whole range&mdash;the energy bill was running in excess of $3 million per annum. It is not hard to understand that when you look at the excess lighting in this building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since I asked that question, there has been an audit of the energy used in this building and I understand that the use of electricity has been minimised. I have not had a recent update of how much it is costing, but one would hope that such things as low energy use appliances, electric motors and low energy lighting can be utilised, and I trust that that has been done in this building. The manufacture of low energy use appliances, electric motors and low energy lighting opens up a whole new field of employment opportunities. There is a whole range of applications which have previously not been considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, people are now looking at the demand side of electrical energy use as well as the supply side of it. We are getting to a stage where people are looking at their excess use of lighting and are asking how they can minimise energy use with the different forms of lighting. There are also different switches available so that they are able to switch off from time to time. The other area under demand management that has received very little attention is the building and construction design of commercial buildings, factories, high rise buildings and even our residences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not much effort has been made to incorporate energy saving design and construction into a lot of our residences. We are still very much at the beginnings of that type of construction. A bit more thought is now being given to how to conserve energy and there are some very innovative architects, building designers and builders who are introducing new techniques and new design features which minimise the use of electrical energy in buildings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">High-rise buildings, most of which are built from steel, glass and a bit of concrete, are massive users of electrical energy. There is a gradual change coming to Australia, whereby people are starting to look at the amount of energy that is being used by those buildings, and they are incorporating new building designs and construction methods. Of course, that is opening up a whole new field for people in the architectural field who are specialising in that area. They are looking at building design, and at how a home can be designed, constructed and put on a site in order to make the home a low energy user. It has a quite dramatic effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now turn to another topic: a Decade of Landcare, and the national Landcare program. The original announcement of the Decade of Landcare was supported by a $340 million funding commitment, over the decade, for land care and related tree planting and remnant vegetation conservation programs. I must say that this program has been particularly successful and has created quite a lot of work, but there are still a vast number of opportunities for employment in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The local committees which run Landcare could always do with some assistance&mdash;in terms of technical expertise, and in terms of just hands-on employment provision&mdash;in order to implement the plans that they have so carefully put together and constructed. Most of the Landcare committees consist of local farmers who understand the local environment and know what is required; but, in many instances, they need a few extra hands. In fact, employment opportunities could be created, provided that the money is directed, through the right channels, into those Landcare committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder, at times&mdash;and mention is made of it in the report&mdash;about the promise made by the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, about the one billion trees program. I have not heard a progress report from the government on the one billion trees program. I hope they have planted some in South Australia, in the electorate of the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford). I hope they have planted some of those one billion trees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member might even know how many trees have been planted. I doubt whether it is one billion. I think the target was one billion trees by the year 2000. Well, there is still plenty of opportunity for volunteer groups and employment schemes whereby trees could be planted in our landscape in Australia. As members would be aware, through the 1800s and the early 1900s, Australia was denuded of much of its tree cover. That has never been replaced, and there is still the opportunity to green Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to receive an update on the one billion trees, and see where they are up to. I do not know who is going to go out and count them all, but I think they are a bit short of their target. I think there is an opportunity there to put money into the development of seed stock and tree stock, to provide a sufficient base to continue that program at a high level and to create some employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final issue that I would like to direct attention to is LEAP, the landcare and environment action program. I have had the opportunity of seeing some of the fine work that has been done under some of the LEAP schemes. I recently attended the reopening of the old shire offices of the Shire of Strathfieldsaye. The Lions Club is now occupying that building. It was refurbished by a group of young people, under the Landcare and environment action program, and they did an excellent job. Not only did they do a good job; they also gained some very valuable skills which, hopefully, will form a foundation for them in applying for other jobs, where they can further develop those skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there is scope under those programs to perhaps do a little more on employment creation schemes and channel a little bit more money into those areas. It needs to be very closely targeted, needs to be done probably in conjunction with local government and the community, so that in fact the supervision is there. But it is an opportunity for employment for a lot of young people to develop their skills and go from there. They can go to an employer and say, `Yes, I have done this and it has been successful. If you would like to go and have a look at it, you can see what skills have been put into place in this project.' There is an opportunity there for employment growth under those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The LEAP program may be another program that could be utilised in the control of blue-green algal growth. That is one of the most serious problems in central and northern Victoria and the conditions, particularly during this year, are very conducive to the growth of blue-green algae. I think there are a number of areas of employment opportunity there, in addition to LEAP funding perhaps being put into some of those programs. There is also an opportunity for the government to put further money into small sewerage projects throughout rural areas. It is an area that it has neglected and it is an area that it cannot continue to neglect, because this problem is not going to go away. The blue-green algal growth in areas of central Victoria ultimately finds its way into the streams. Two of the streams, the Campaspe River and the Loddon River, feed into the Murray-Darling system. I know that the quality of the water in the Murray-Darling system is a matter very dear to the heart of the member for Port Adelaide&mdash;and to yours too, Mr Deputy Speaker, as the honourable member for Wakefield. A lot of the effluent that is coming from small rural towns in these areas that do not have sewerage is ultimately finding its way into the Murray-Darling system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak to this report on environmental policies which stimulate employment growth from the Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working with the environment: opportunities for job growth</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To pick up on some of the matters that the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) has mentioned, the committee acknowledged in its report and its recommendations the importance of the program that he mentioned, LEAP. In recommendations 44 to 49 we make some mention of that. Certainly the committee saw that programs such as LEAP, the regional environmental employment program, REEP, and jobskills can be very beneficial. But what we really needed to do was to make sure that in the monitoring of these programs we looked equally at the environmental benefits and the employment benefits. I think that some of the best work that we saw during the inquiry was being done by Greening Australia, which was actually responsible for putting forward to government, in the green paper and white paper process, the proposal for a REEP program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at what it was hoping to achieve in a program like REEP, one understands that it had taken those elements of the LEAP scheme and jobskills that it thought were important and put them together in a regional sense where the work that could be done under those umbrellas had a focus that fulfilled parts of an overall management plan. That plan not only had those things that we were looking for in the employment sense&mdash;skills training, employment experience and the like&mdash;but also was able to achieve benefits through repairing and maintaining our land and water. People like Mark Jackson and others who were working with Greening Australia are to be congratulated on the type of work they have done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the evidence that they put to us, they quite rightly said that agricultural production counts for more than 25 per cent of our export income. If we are not treating the basic necessities of agricultural production&mdash;the land and the water&mdash;in an appropriate way, that is causing a great damage to our potential economic benefit. As was said in the various tabling statements in the main chamber on Monday of this week, this report comes at a very important time when the Australian community at large is showing great maturity at being able to see that our environmental and employment objectives do not have to seem to be in conflict, that there is great mutual benefit in looking at them together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report also comes at a time when the greens job unit, a joint project of the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Australian Council of Trade Unions, released its report last month <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Green jobs in industry</EMPHASIS>. As was said in the tabling statements, anything that raises people's awareness about the way in which we can reach our employment objectives, at the same time as satisfying our environmental objectives, is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to touch on the potential Australia has to take the environmental technology that we are starting to put in place and use it overseas, especially in our region. One of the things that was difficult throughout the course of the inquiry&mdash;and it is something that the greens job unit of the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Australian Council of Trade Unions has gone to&mdash;is the question of what are environmental industries. The committee took the view that we should not get too hung up on an exact definition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The International Labour Organisation's classification of environmental industries lists nine categories and gives an idea of the breadth of potential environment industries. Firstly, it lists pollution abatement with respect to air, water and soils&mdash;something that the honourable member for Bendigo and I have gone to; secondly, land rehabilitation, including agricultural mining&mdash;again, something that the honourable member mentioned; thirdly, soft energies, energy conservation, biogas, biofuel, solar energy and wind; fourthly, transport and communications, substitution of public transport, particularly a role for private transport modes, which is something that Australia has not pursued enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is pleasing that further extension of the light rail system has been encouraged under the better cities program in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, where it will match up with the development for housing on surplus land that was previously used by Community Services, Victoria. Fifthly, under the ILO definition, is water and sewerage works; sixthly, recycling and waste management; seventhly, conservation and forestry, including eco-tourism; eighthly, environmental research and development and training for technology skill development infrastructure; and, ninthly, environment administration and public works employment in regulatory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in my statement when the report was tabled, one of the things we are pushing through this report is the need to set in place national standards, particularly for air and water, and to see that those are enforced. I was pleased to see in the report of the ACF and ACTU <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Green jobs in industry</EMPHASIS> that that inquiry had similar outcomes. The honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell), in particular, when he was speaking to the tabling, highlighted one of the recommendations that, if I had had more time, I would have highlighted from the environment committee's report&mdash;namely, recommendation (11) that the national environment standard should be outcome oriented rather than process oriented, and stringently and rigorously based on scientific grounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, it does not really matter how we reach that end point, but we need to ensure that we are going to reach it. As we have said, and continue to say&mdash;especially as a recurring theme for this environment, recreation and arts committee, as we go around Australia&mdash;we see in most of our work, and it is put to us by others, that there is a need for national standards. I often get a little frustrated that, because of the nature of the federation and of the division of powers under the constitution, sometimes we have blockages to that goal. It is very important in environmental matters that we see a cooperative effort and cooperative federalism to achieve the outcomes that we hope for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the global dimension, the OECD estimated the market for environmental goods and services, based on figures from 1990, at about $270 billion. As the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) mentioned last Monday, that exceeds the estimate for the world aerospace market, which at that time was $250 billion. If you put the figures in that light, that is a considerable part of the global economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), and I am pleased that he is on duty here in the Main Committee as Deputy Government Whip. Earlier this year in the chamber, and even before that, he has been somebody who, in the context of the development of employment policies, has been pushing the environmental aspect. He has shown, through various suggestions and the highlighting of overseas studies, the importance of environmental industries for future employment generation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the honourable member's more telling statements highlighted the Japanese experience, where even a ministry like MITI&mdash;a ministry which from time to time is looked upon with a great deal of awe&mdash;has indeed emphasised the potential for Japan in developing environmental technologies. Those sorts of things are important. Among the things that Japan has to handle is an horrendous waste management problem. If we think Australia has a very bad waste management problem at present, consider the area of land available in Japan for the population. One can easily imagine how difficult the disposal of household waste is there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had the opportunity to visit the Japanese equivalent of a municipal waste dump, which had quite a large incinerator. It did not have to be a very high temperature incinerator, because it was only dealing with household waste, so it was quite environmentally sound. In that case, a relatively small residential development some half-kilometre distant from the incinerator was being fully powered by the incinerator. There was a balancing of a potential problem of getting rid of waste by turning it into a resource base, so that the energy that was produced in the process of getting rid of the waste was in turn used to heat and power local housing. If we can take such an approach to problems, we can come up with solutions that have an economic and employment benefit as well as an environmental benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to our local region and the potential to use Australian environmental technology, AIDAB said in its submission to the committee that something like $A100 million a year of our aid effort is put to environmental purposes. The important thing to remember is that 90 per cent of the aid budget is spent directly in Australia through purchases of goods and services, generating considerable employment locally. That is an area where we can show some leadership by sitting down with countries in our region and offering them the expertise that we have, which has the benefit of addressing a number of their environmental problems at the same time as enabling local economic benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A project that Australians can be very proud of as part of our aid effort is our longstanding involvement with reafforestation in Nepal. That is, I think, now into its fourth cycle. We are not talking only about assisting people in replacing forests that have been destroyed. What we are doing is sitting down with them and assisting them in ensuring that their reafforestation involves sustainable development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay special tribute to the forestry department at ANU, whose people have been involved in this right from the start. They do it now through one of their commercial arms. That leads me to thank the secretariat of the committee once again for its work with this report, acknowledging that the committee secretary, Ian Dundas, is a product of ANU forestry. From time to time I have mentioned that to him, being myself a product of the ANU science department and having had some uncharitable thoughts about foresters at ANU, but in this case they have done Australia proud through their efforts in Nepal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have seen there is attention to environmental benefit and economic benefit&mdash;economic benefit to villagers who have the self-management of the programs, given the expertise that the Australians who work with them are able to transfer to them. The ANU foresters are examples of what Australia can do internationally. They are examples, as the honourable member for Bendigo mentioned in connection with the one billion trees and other such programs, of what we can continue to do locally. I hope that our report plays a part in continuing to show that the environment and employment can work together. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commence with one of the points that the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) finished with&mdash;to pay tribute to the committee secretariat, who worked so well and so harmoniously with the committee in carrying out its tasks and putting together this report. Also I pay tribute again to the committee chair, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), for the excellent work that he did. In some ways it has not been an easy task, but all the comments that were made on Monday when the report was presented to the House were quite positive and the contributions about the nature and meaning of this report were quite enthusiastic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to some of the changes that have occurred. We started the report in May 1993, almost 18 months ago. There has been a significant increase in employment across Australia since that time. While there are more people employed than ever before, we certainly must maintain vigilance, as a government, to develop and create new employment opportunities. Ideally, new employment opportunities would integrate job creation and environmental sustainability. Employment and the environment are certainly two of the biggest issues facing Australia and our future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to the previous work of the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), a member of the caucus committee, in getting onto the government's agenda the white paper and the initiatives that were in that, with the employment and job creation opportunities that the government is involved in and the changes to ensure that the long-term unemployed are assisted through training. I will return to that if time permits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employment and the environment are two of the big issues facing Australia and our future. As the polls show, they are the two issues which people still put on their agenda as the most important things. The continued integration of these two issues represents a shift in the way modern society thinks. In years gone by, employment had been generated regardless of the environmental implications. I am glad to say that mostly those days are well and truly behind us, though certainly there is still going to be debate about where the balance falls. I do not think we will ever be able to move away from that debate; no doubt the balance will swing between the two, but by and large what is firmly on the agenda is that everyone agrees there has to be a balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been an increased focus on the need to incorporate the environmental implications in the current planning and development practices across all facets of the community. It is certainly true in the employment field. Right now we have the debate about the woodchip export licences and the implications for employment within Australia. Many years ago we would not have had that debate. It is good that we are having the debate now. I hope that society does not expect there to be winners and losers from it. If the debate is to run its full course, there will be winners only, regardless of where the balance falls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Whian Whian State Forest, just outside my electorate near Lismore, there is a debate about logging practices in the area, the need for an EIS and the incorporation of Aboriginal input into the management of the sites. The debate in that small area is similar to the debate which has occurred and is occurring across Australia and will continue to occur. In this case, in the forest there are probably 20 or so jobs that the foresters feel are at threat. I think it would be fair to say that, if suitable practices are not put in place, we might be looking at 20 jobs for two or three years at the most. If we come down to a sustainable practice, however, perhaps incorporating tourism, we might be looking at 10 to 15 jobs for ever and a day. When we do the sums, we have to err on the side of caution and look towards sustainable practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report makes 54 recommendations, which I believe provide a map for the future in the areas of employment and the environment. The successful implementation of many of these recommendations will certainly need the support and cooperation of the three tiers of government, the industry sector and the wider community. As committee members would know, this cooperation is already developing. The establishment of a high-level Commonwealth inter-agency group to coordinate and raise the level of interdepartmental cooperation on matters of the environment and employment will play an important role in integrating Commonwealth programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, there are many programs, such as the landcare and environment action program, or LEAP, the recently established regional environment employment program, or REEP, Landcare, the save the bush program and the one billion trees program, carrying out excellent work in the environment. I endorse the comments that you made, Mr Deputy Speaker, in your capacity as member for Scullin, paying tribute to Mark Jackson for the work he has done for Greening Australia. He has done tremendous work, particularly on the north coast&mdash;I see lots of the work that he does up there&mdash;but also across New South Wales and Australia. Because of that work, Greening Australia has been able to have an input into government policy, particularly with REEP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A more coordinated approach to such programs would streamline their operations and allow greater efficiency on the ground, where the money is best spent. Increasing funding to the Department of Industry, Science and Technology, Austrade and the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau to promote our environment industry will not only reap economic benefits but introduce environmental procedures and practices in developing nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is appropriate to mention the possible outcomes of the APEC talks. A lot has been said in the paper about trade and so forth, but an issue that has not been mentioned is the environment. I will be so bold as to suggest that, with the increasing cooperation between nations, as trade opens up and better linkages develop between nations&mdash;whether they be cultural or economic&mdash;there will be a lot more inspection, a bit more criticism and certainly a greater movement towards better and more sustainable environmental practices in all those nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past, and, indeed, in the present, a degree of conflict has arisen where there has been criticism inside one country of another and in some ways it has been resented. One of the benefits of APEC may be that we may have more of a family grouping in a global sense. That may mean that that sort of criticism can be directed in a more constructive manner and that there will be a more constructive approach to intellectual and technological transfer. In this way, countries will be able to improve practices and thus the impact on the environment may not be so severe. While the environment was not on the agenda, I am sure that it will be one of the good practices which flows from our movement towards APEC and the cooperation which that will entail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The promotion of greener production in the industry sector is certainly welcomed. While it is difficult to immediately quantify the benefits from restructuring production procedures, it is important that companies move in this direction and take a long-term approach to cleaner production. Consumers are increasingly conscious of products that are environmentally friendly or use clean production processes. Many of the food distributors, not to mention the manufacturers, are recognising that and moving towards taking that into consideration with their labelling and product promotion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increased promotion of energy efficiency and the renewable energy initiatives is important in the reduction of non-renewable energy sources. The recent promotion in my electorate of a Commonwealth initiative, the energy card, generated both strong response and interest. The report also recommends a substantial increase of funding to the national landcare program, a program that has been well supported by the local communities. The allocation of increased funding to the community landcare component will certainly build on the success achieved by local land care groups across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have only touched on a few of those recommendations and there are many more that I could discuss. I certainly took the opportunity in the House when the report was presented, as you did, Mr Deputy Speaker, to allude to the recommendation on pollution control and the need for standards in the way we implement those to have them outcome orientated rather than process orientated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to one of the aspects that I mentioned when I was talking about Greening Australia and Mark Jackson's contribution and that is the notion of green jobs. The north coast of New South Wales is a region that has huge potential for green jobs in a number of areas and there is enormous potential in eco-tourism. We do have World Heritage listed rainforests in the region and on the coastal strip and there is potential in the area of waste management and disposal, recycling and, to some extent, power generation. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might mention one of the icons in my electorate&mdash;Mount Warning. Many members may be familiar with this; it is one of the Tweed Valley's most significant landmarks. It has enormous potential as a base for an eco-tourism industry as long as it is controlled by stringent operational guidelines. Certainly we do not need fleets of four-wheel drive vehicles tearing up the area's sensitive ecosystem. What we do need is eco-tourism operators who are knowledgeable about the area they work in and are sensitive to its fragility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A weekend meeting on the Tweed suggested, amongst other things, a cable car on Mount Nullum and&mdash;wait for it&mdash;someone called Volcano Man who could actually meet tourists at Coolangatta airport. </PARA>

No doubt the discussion that sort of proposition will generate will see it dealt with accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent promotion of the energy card in my electorate, as I mentioned, was very well received. There is a bright future for solar generation in the region. Many people are building houses that are energy efficient. While not directly dealt with in the report, I might allude to the Kingscliff high school students who have recently won a statewide competition which enabled them to put a proposal to the minister for the environment. The proposal that they took to the minister was actually a proposal for an energy efficient school classroom and building. I think they are to be congratulated for the initiative and the foresight they demonstrated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further expansion that I would also like to take into consideration is the Mullumbimby power station. It is unique in the sense that it was one of two or three developed in the twenties or thirties that were driven by hydro power. Now that the area is linked up to the grid it is only used at the moment as a back-up for emergency services because of its lower generating capacity. The power station itself is certainly worth while visiting. Apart from the fact that it is useful as a stand-by on an emergency basis, people would be fascinated to see just how far-sighted some people were in the twenties and the thirties. </PARA>
