<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to table the report of the committee's inquiry into the role and function of the Law Reform Commission of Australia. This report is the first comprehensive parliamentary review of the Law Reform Commission of Australia in its almost 20 years of existence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two main aspects of the inquiry. Firstly, the committee examined the role and function of the Law Reform Commission as a separate and permanent law reform agency. Secondly, the committee reviewed the relationships between the commission and other bodies with a law reform or related function. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the first point, we have concluded that the current role and functions of the Law Reform Commission are still appropriate. The independence and objectivity of the Law Reform Commission is founded in part in its statutory nature, and in part in the independent management and operations of the commission. The commission is an important source of independent advice for the government because of its capacity for accessing expert and representative opinion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recognises that its national character is the distinguishing feature of the Law Reform Commission. In the federal context, the application of complementary laws of each Australian jurisdiction is an important development. It would be appropriate for the Law Reform Commission to be able to consider proposals for the complementarity of laws of the Commonwealth on the one hand and of the territories and the states on the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The distinctive contribution that a permanent and separate law reform commission can make to the reform of the legal system lies in its capacity for detailed research, extensive consultation and critical analysis. With regard to the second aspect of this inquiry, the committee examined the roles of some of the statutory and non-statutory bodies which advise the federal government and considered the relationship each has with the commission. The committee found that there is value in providing a range and diversity of advice to the government, recognising the importance of current mechanisms in promoting cooperation between the Law Reform Commission and the other advisory bodies, and reducing wasteful duplication in their operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee considers that there should be greater emphasis on promoting joint projects between the Law Reform Commission and state and territory law reform bodies. While the committee acknowledges that problems of a constitutional and jurisdictional nature may affect the selection of joint projects, the committee concludes that joint projects are both necessary and useful, because part of the role of a national law reform commission is to assist in the systematic development of the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee considers that the influence of the work of the Law Reform Commission over almost 20 years has been very significant. In the years since the Law Reform Commission was established, a great deal of law reform work has been done, but the challenge continues. The need for law reform has not diminished. The implementation of our recommendations will lead to the correction of impediments to the smooth operations of the Law Reform Commission, and to the enhancement of its value to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to acknowledge the work of the committee's secretariat. The committee secretary Judy Middlebrook, the inquiry secretary Claressa Surtees, and the administrative officer Paula Baker all made significant contributions to the inquiry and the report. On behalf of the committee, I thank them. Too often we as members of parliament take for granted our support structure&mdash;committee secretariats, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> reporting and other facilities. It certainly assists in the preparation of reports such as this to have professional people in those positions. The parliament is indebted to them. I commend the report to the parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was general unanimity among members of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its report on the Law Reform Commission. The report was fascinating and far reaching. It was a reference from the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), who requested the committee to report in a fairly quick period. The committee was unable to keep to the Attorney-General's timetable because there were lots of views on the role of the commission, its future and the purpose it has served over the past 20 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report today, however, includes extensive evidence that was taken by the committee. On balance, the committee decided that the only authority with a capacity to refer matters to the Law Reform Commission should be the Attorney-General. That was a unanimous view of the committee and one that was decided after the committee took evidence from the commission and other interested bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The clearer management structure proposed by the committee is something that will improve the efficiency and the timeliness of reports. One of the factors that has distressed those interested in law reform has been the sometimes extensive delays in the preparation of significant reports. Sometimes this is not a matter that has been brought about by the commission being tardy but, rather, by the Attorney-General loading additional references onto the commission. The management structure, in my view, appeared to be deficient in a number of areas, and this report seeks to rectify that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another sensible proposal is the recommendation that experienced practitioners be appointed as consultants and advisers to the Law Reform Commission. It is my view that a couple of reports&mdash;perhaps three&mdash;which attracted a lot of adverse attention from the community really were brought about because of the predominance of an academic type of legal involvement. The committee has rightly recommended that practitioners&mdash;legal people dealing with the law and the processes of law on the ground day to day&mdash;should play a greater role in the activities of the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some states have expressed the view that the Law Reform Commission has too readily involved itself in a wish to create uniformity and to overturn the interests of states in law reform. I have some sympathy with that view. It is my intention to write an expression of concern, which will be included in the report, indicating that the Attorney-General needs to adopt a great deal of care in making recommendations for the commission to research. There are so many areas needing law reform that the Australian Law Reform Commission has plenty of scope without straying into areas on the margin. We mentioned the need for complementary legislation. That is a new innovation for the commission to consider. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I acknowledge the expression of concern by my colleague the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper). He wished to see the Australian Law Reform Commission renamed as the Commonwealth Law Reform Commission. He also expressed concern about the production of draft legislation. The production of draft legislation by the Law Reform Commission is a lengthy process which takes a lot of resources and time, but it is an interesting and useful tool to the commission in the progress of its work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Attorney-General ought to always have the right to ask the commission to produce draft legislation and that, as a tool, the commission ought to have the freedom of using draft legislation. It should not as a matter of practice develop the concept that draft legislation is the best way to have its will win the day. That is not what law reform is about, in my view. It is about putting up interesting proposals which over a period of time may or may not be adopted. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, of the review of the Auditor-General's reports No. 36 of 1992-93; No. 1 of 1993-94, volume 3, sections 1.13-39; and No. 27 of 1993-94, sections 16.19-24, together with the minutes of proceedings.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ST4">Mr GIBSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report I have just tabled is the review of several audit reports by the committee. Audit report No. 36 was a project audit on ATSIC's provision of community infrastructure. The committee is satisfied with the departmental responses to the audit office's recommendations. However, there are two areas of particular concern to the committee. These are in relation to the decision making processes of the regional councils and the additional responsibilities and costs that might have been imposed on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities as a result of the changes in Commonwealth regulatory activities in relation to civil airstrips. Before moving to those issues, the committee commented that while it endorses the first key finding of the audit we believe that it does not go far enough. The audit office found:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The respective responsibilities of Commonwealth, State/Territory and local Governments in the provision of community infrastructure to indigenous communities are unclear and ATSIC may be funding projects properly the responsibility of other levels of government.</PARA>
<PARA>This finding is not new to the committee, which has been drawing attention to this problem for some time. The committee has gone further in previous reports and states that it is beyond doubt that in a great many instances ATSIC is funding services and projects which are the responsibility of state, territory or local governments. The committee is becoming increasingly impatient at the lack of action on many of the recommendations that have been made by the committee on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recommends that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) take urgent action through the Council of Australian Governments to ensure that the diversion of mainstream funding away from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people ceases and that he review the recommendations made by the committee on this matter over the last decade to ensure that they are being implemented. On the question of decision making by ATSIC regional councils, recommendation 5 of the audit report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO recommends that ATSIC encourage Regional Councils to document reasons for funding.</PARA>
<PARA>ATSIC strongly disagreed with this recommendation. It stated that regional councils are responsible for proposing the allocation of funds and the administrative arm is responsible for the assessment of projects and documentation and identifying need and does this as part of the current assessment process. There are two issues involved: whether reasons for regional council funding decisions should be documented in some way; and whether a regional council's decisions are reviewable by another agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the second issue, the committee believes that the ANAO has erred in trying to impose bureaucratic accountability for political decisions that ATSIC regional councils have been elected to make. The committee believes that accountability should apply to the briefing and assessment prepared by ATSIC officers on projects which go before regional councils to assist them in making their decisions, and funds allocated to and disbursed by regional councils to ensure that they are spent in accordance with the ATSIC Act and the priorities of the regional plan as determined by the regional council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee does not believe that the decisions of regional councils, provided they are lawful, should be accountable in the same way as decisions made by public servants. Where approvals represent a significant departure from the priorities of the regional plan, the committee recognises that community acceptance would be assisted if the reasons for the decision are publicly announced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having regional councils document their reasons for all funding decisions implies that decisions are subject to review by a superior agency. This would be contrary to the intent of the establishing legislation. The committee finds that, in making its recommendation, the ANAO did not take sufficient care in determining the intent of the ATSIC legislation. There are pitfalls for those who seek to assume a superior position from which to assess the `correctness' of political decisions. In the audit report, the ANAO makes itself the arbiter of the appropriateness of decisions made by the regional councils, by stating that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . other needs, in the ANAO's view more pressing, were passed over.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee believes that, given the legislated function of the regional council to make decisions, it is not appropriate for the ANAO to review the priorities determined by regional councils with respect to funding programs such as infrastructure projects. It is not a requirement imposed on federal cabinet, state cabinets or local government authorities to put in writing the reasons why some proposals were funded in the budget and not others. It is inappropriate to recommend that the ATSIC political structure should be required to do this when other levels of government do not conduct their political decision-making processes in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recommends that ATSIC encourage regional councils to announce the reasons for funding decisions whenever possible. The opposition members of the committee, while agreeing on the remainder of the report, have dissented on this last recommendation. Whilst I leave it to them to explain their position, their recommendation seeks to further curtail the independence of the regional councils. I, along with other government members, am disappointed by the decision to dissent as we went to great lengths within the committee to try to accommodate all views and gain a consensus on the issue. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The other major area of concern to the committee in Audit report No. 36 deals with the additional responsibilities and costs being imposed on indigenous communities through recent changes in Commonwealth service and regulatory arrangements for civil airstrips. The audit report also pointed to a lack of access and equity for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in relation to the remote air service subsidy scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody recommended that the operation of the aerodrome local ownership scheme be extended to Aboriginal community councils. Despite the Commonwealth claiming to support this recommendation, it has in fact withdrawn from the ALOP. The department admitted that no consultations were held specifically with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities before the ALOP was dropped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recommends that the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) review his department's response to recommendation 78 of the royal commission given the Commonwealth's support for this recommendation to ensure that effect is given to the thrust of the recommendation. The committee had difficulties with the department's reasons as to why Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities did not have equitable access to the scheme. There is clearly a lack of understanding by the department of the air service needs of many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, particularly those of out-stations. There is also a clear lack of understanding of the entitlements of such communities. The access and equity strategy is meant to ensure such entitlements are recognised and services provided equitably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems identified in this report show that the department's implementation of the Commonwealth's access and equity strategy has been quite ineffectual. There is a lack of a clear implementation strategy for the access and equity strategy as it relates to aviation. From the evidence provided to the committee, there appears to be a total lack of appropriate performance indicators for implementation of social justice measures, particularly as they relate to minority groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recommends that the Minister for Transport undertake reviews of both the Department of Transport and the Civil Aviation Authority to ensure their active compliance with the Commonwealth's access and equity strategy and social justice principles. This review should result in each agency having both a clear set of social justice objectives with appropriate performance indicators and a clear set of access and equity objectives with appropriate performance indicators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also recommends that the Minister for Transport, in deciding on the future of the remote air services subsidy scheme, ensure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities are fully consulted and that they have access to basic air services where no suitable alternative mode of transport is available. I will end my comments there in deference to the Deputy Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl). </PARA>

All Australians are aware that the Commonwealth and the states are providing large sums of money for the benefit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. As one goes around the country speaking to individuals and groups, one realises that there is widespread concern that it appears that a lot of that money is not getting down to the grassroots level.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KG4">Mr LANGMORE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The efficiency audit that is reviewed in the report I have just presented found a serious discrepancy in the development and delivery of an important government initiative. The audit dealt with the administration of the national energy management program that is managed by the department. The current program had its origins in an interim package of greenhouse measures announced in October 1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Primary Industries and Energy was given the responsibility of implementing these measures. It responded by expanding its existing energy management program, which was by that time little more than a carryover from the 1970s oil shock. The expanded program came to include over 50 subprograms which varied widely in nature and scope and which shared extremely limited financial and human resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite this expansion of the program, the department failed to give sufficient priority to the program, and its response can be described as nothing more than half-hearted. The auditors found that the department had not taken sufficient action to implement the package of measures announced by the government, despite the sense of urgent priority that the government had intended. It also appears that insufficient funds and staff have been provided to enable the department to develop a more appropriate program. The committee felt that the government failed to give adequate direction to the bureaucracy or to allocate sufficient funds or staff to the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consultants were also commissioned by the department to conduct an evaluation of the program. The consultants found that only two of the 25 major subprograms could be regarded as being highly effective. They also found that, at existing funding levels, the program would contribute only about 10 per cent of the required reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and even then only if the program was made more effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, it appears that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy is acting on the auditors' findings. The audit was an important catalyst for change, and the auditors believe that their presence contributed to the department acting more responsively towards the implementation of the program. The process of change initiated by the audit seems to have gained momentum with the report by the consultants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, greatly increased financial and staffing resources must be committed to allow the program to expand to a level that will do more towards attaining the government's greenhouse gas emissions reduction target. The current level of expected funding for each of the next three financial years is grossly inadequate, given the potential annual savings of $1.5 billion that the government estimates could be realised if its target is achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has made several recommendations which reinforce the findings of both the auditors and the independent consultants. If implemented, our recommendations, along with those of the auditors and the consultants, will provide a basis for the major expansion and improvement of the program, which is certainly required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next year the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was recently ratified by Australia, will meet in Berlin to review global action on climate change. Australia must be able to show that it is playing its part. Our commitment to programs such as the national energy management program will have to be demonstrably better than the half-hearted approach taken so far. The committee intends to monitor administration of the program to ensure that this will be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before concluding, I would like to warmly thank the committee secretariat for their work on this report, and in particular Gabrielle Jess, who wrote the draft. Ian Dundas, the committee secretary, oversaw the preparation and Sue Irvine and Marlene Lyons edited the report and prepared it for publication.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the second time this year that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts has reported to parliament on an Auditor-General's efficiency audit, and for the second time this year the committee has found it necessary to bring down a report concurring with the Auditor-General's pretty scathing criticism of the administration and management of a government program.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy has failed to demonstrate due care, diligence and enthusiasm to ensure the success of this program. It must be added also that the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) seems to have taken little action to ensure that this program, which was announced with great fanfare and enthusiasm, has come to any kind of successful conclusion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national energy management plan is a part of the government's greenhouse response strategy and is obviously designed to reduce Australia's greenhouse emissions. This program contains a diverse range of measures which are, at best, designed to bring about a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions equivalent to only 10 per cent of our required target. Nonetheless, this program is central to the national greenhouse response strategy. It is important that Australia is not only seen to be taking positive steps in this area but is also achieving worthwhile results for our environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The administration of the program was reviewed by the Australian National Audit Office and its effectiveness has also been assessed by independent consultants. Both assessments found that there were serious shortcomings in the program and its administration. In particular, the department was found to have failed to respond with the level of urgency suggested in the government's announcement of the program. This led to unacceptable delays in most elements of the program that were eventually developed. Those elements that were developed were found to be less than fully effective. As the chairman of the committee said, only two of the 25 measures implemented in the program were considered to be reasonably effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department has taken steps to remedy the situation, but the program remains grossly underresourced. It has to be said that there must be considerable doubt as to how much commitment there ever was to the national energy management program. Certainly the commitment that was there when the program was announced has clearly faded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Funding reached $6.8 million in 1992-93 but has declined to $6.4 million in 1993-94. The budget announced earlier this month provides only $5.59 million for each of the next four years. When that amount is divided amongst 50 separate subprograms, clearly there is very little money available to achieve anything worth while. It seems as though this program was announced so that we could be seen to be doing something about greenhouse emissions to satisfy international observers and local conservationists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have never devoted adequate staff or financial resources to achieve any kind of worthwhile result. The excuse put forward by the department was that there were insufficient people available even though we have a Public Service comprising over 150,000 people. At that time there were 4,000 people in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy but it is clear that the staff were allocated to other areas because the commitment in other areas was greater. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to say a lot about the subject of greenhouse emissions. There would be real benefits to the Australian economy and the environment in having effective programs in that regard. However, this report is about government management and the way in which a particular program was handled. The minister took little interest in the day-to-day affairs of this program even after there was an indication that little was being achieved. There was plenty of publicity but, seemingly, a lack of responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was all said by John Wicks, the First Assistant Secretary to the department, when giving evidence to the committee. He said that when there was only $1 million available the department took the view that the government was only half-hearted about it and it was not worth trying. That half-heartedness permeated the attitude of the department towards this program and, naturally, it has been less effective than was intended when the government made the announcement and this was certainly not the objective of the Australian people when supporting this kind of initiative. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Greenhouse response: effectiveness of the implementation of an interim program&mdash;a review of Audit report No. 32 of 1992-93&mdash;an efficiency audit of the implementation of an interim greenhouse response</EMPHASIS> presented to the House this afternoon is in some ways an indication of the level of commitment the government and the bureaucracy have given to the reduction of greenhouse gases. This is a policy that this government will need to follow. As the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) pointed out, the report does point to some inadequacies in the administration of the program. I would like to correct a comment made by the honourable member for Wide Bay. He said that this is the second report that the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts has presented to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) this year. This report is a response to the implementation of the energy management program conducted by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the audit of that program conducted by the Australian National Audit Office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The audit office, I think quite correctly, was critical of the management of the program and the commitment that has been given thus far. As the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) pointed out, the consultants who also independently assessed some of the programs found that only two of them were completely followed through and implemented. A number of other programs or subprograms were only partly implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without doubt, as the honourable member for Wide Bay indicated, if the government and the country at large are to respond in an effective manner to the likely greenhouse effect, there has to be a lot more commitment, and that commitment must come from both funding and a commitment within the bureaucracy to have that funding act effectively towards the targets that the government, in this case, will need to set. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the overall effects of the greenhouse gas emissions, there is still considerable debate. However, most people recognise the need for us to adopt a no regrets policy on that. While a no regrets policy will not necessarily lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, it certainly is the base from which we must start. The government must be prepared to put the money in to ensure that staffing levels which, as has been indicated in the report, are not present are there and that we give them the regulations to implement the targets and strategies which have to be implemented in terms of achieving our stated goals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does appear that the stated goals, as we define them, are somewhat elusive in that sense. That is to be regretted because of the need for the implementation of these targets. Overall, as the honourable member for Fraser indicated in his remarks, there are benefits to be gained from pursuing this. The net benefit, if we measure it in an economic sense, can be portrayed as some $1.5 billion through achieving the targets. On the way through there will be some difficulty. Certainly, when we look at the estimates of the net greenhouse gas emissions for 1987-88, we find that some 63 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions are contributed through energy production and distribution, and the use of energy in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put in place targets or policies which will see that 63 per cent and the total amount produced come down will cause some problems. Even the honourable member for Wide Bay, while he is very rightly endorsing the thrust of this report the committee has presented to the House today, would no doubt be very concerned about the way some of the policies might be put in place to achieve those targets, particularly the types of industries which might be affected immediately. In implementing these targets, we also have to avoid the soft targets first up. We have to be prepared to think in terms of the long term, where we need to go and the sort of support that is put in place. Some of the legislation which I anticipate will come into the House this week or next week, such as the ethanol bounty fuel amendment bills, is part of that. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I suppose we could say that this report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Greenhouse response: effectiveness of the implementation of an interim program&mdash;a review of Audit report No. 32 of 1992-93&mdash;an efficiency audit of the implementation of an interim greenhouse response</EMPHASIS> had its genesis in the conference in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 at which Australia, along with a number of other countries, agreed to pay some definite attention to the problem of greenhouse gas emissions. Australia signed that convention and agreed to adopt an interim planning target. The Australian people who were concerned about us entering into agreements such as this on an international level will be pleased to know that Australia did so with a caveat so that we could implement a program that was not detrimental to our nation's industries and our economic wellbeing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is always a great need to bring about a balance in these matters. Certainly for some of us progress is not fast enough, but there has been a considerable move by governments and industry to address this problem. It is heartening that changes are taking place, but it was disappointing that the government&mdash;and perhaps the minister in this case&mdash;has not seen fit to follow up this program a little more vigorously. The Auditor-General's report was very critical of the way Australia has gone about adopting and implementing the recommendations in its planning. So we continue to be less than vigorous in the way we pursue the greenhouse gas emission problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern I have is that it seems that the government has used this on an international basis as a platform for grandstanding and also for playing to environmental groups in our nation, with no real intention of coming to grips with the greenhouse gas emission problem. That is evident not so much in the way the departments have gone about their task but in the lack of commitment to funding this program, the lack of commitment to follow up and the lack of real concern about where the program is going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's contribution to net global greenhouse gas emissions is particularly high. We rank 15th on the list of world contributors and we have the third highest source of emissions on a per capita basis. It is estimated that, by the year 2005, over two-thirds of Australia's main greenhouse gas emissions will be due to the supply and use of energy. Our two largest users of energy are transport and manufacturing, which each account for just over one-third of Australia's total energy use. They are significant figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That we need to participate with the rest of the world in a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is not in question. Improvements need not be costly or daunting to industry both from a competitive point of view and a profitability point of view. Industry can increase its profitability and its competitiveness, while simultaneously preserving our environment and cutting its energy costs and thus the emission of greenhouse gases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A significant contribution could be made to the competitiveness and profitability of industry with greater assurance from the national energy management program in achieving more efficient means of energy with a resulting low cost. The department has stated that it is underresourced and underfunded. I find it a little curious that this should be the case because the government has implemented an extra 2c tax on leaded fuel. Yet we are not really putting that tax back into solving this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other problem is our road funding, which has been reduced again. The condition of our roads can increase our energy use and our output of harmful gases into the atmosphere. So there are two positive ways we could address this problem. The sum of $140 million in income will be raised from the additional 2c excise on lead that is now being implemented. We have put $100,000 of that money into looking at the problem of lead and emissions. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>I put this motion before the House because it is about time the Cape York Peninsula Land Use Strategy, commonly called CYPLUS, got the recognition and accolades that it deserves. CYPLUS is an outstanding example of cooperation between government and the community in relation to land use management. I am pleased to say that that cooperation is happening in my electorate of Leichhardt. There have been land use studies done around the world, most notably in Canada, however none have had the opportunity to examine such a vast and relatively unscathed area of land at such a critical time in its history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Goss Labor government came to power in Queensland in December 1989, 137,000 square kilometres of the Cape York Peninsula were subject to many competing interests. There were plans for a space base on the peninsula; property developer George Quaid had just finalised the freehold purchase of the massive Starke property on the east coast; there were successful mining operations at Weipa and Cape Flattery; pastoralists held 54 per cent of land tenure; and four-wheel drive enthusiasts pushed their vehicles all over the peninsula's rough dirt roads. At the same time, many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities were without basic infrastructure such as regular power, water and communications services, and some conservation groups were calling for the whole of the Cape York Peninsula to be nominated for World Heritage listing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cape York Peninsula is a very remote area, larger than the state of Victoria. It is home to around 11,000 people, over 50 per cent of whom are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living in communities of 200 people or more, most of which are located near the coast. Because of the peninsula's monsoonal tropical climate many of the roads are inaccessible for up to half of the year during the wet season, from November to April. Air and sea become the only reliable forms of transport at this time. Clearly, the Cape York Peninsula is one of the last great wilderness areas in the world, but it is under pressure from a range of often competing interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To summarise, the peninsula is economically important as a resource base for the mining, fishing, tourism and pastoral industries; culturally important as the traditional country of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; and ecologically important as one of the world's last monsoonal regions undamaged by industrial society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than sit back and let the region be developed in an ad hoc, unsustainable way the Goss Labor government took up an offer to team up with the Commonwealth to conduct a land use study to develop a framework for making decisions about how to use and manage the national resources of the peninsula in ways that will be economically, culturally and ecologically sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to go ahead with the CYPLUS process has been of positive assistance to me as a federal member. The factors that I mentioned above regarding the diversity of interests and remoteness and isolation make it a very difficult region to service as a local MP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will certainly be doing my utmost to ensure that the Commonwealth continues to provide adequate funding for the strategy. The CYPLUS has been funded jointly by the Queensland state government and the Commonwealth to the tune of $7.6 million for stage one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Work on the CYPLUS is being carried out in three stages and public participation must be an important part of each stage. Stage one, which is nearing completion, is information collection. Through public participation, the information needed to decide which current and potential land users on the peninsula are ecologically sustainable is being collected. Stage two is policy making. Community groups will use the information from stage one and combine it with the social and cultural priorities needed to build the land use strategy which will be made up in a number of land use policies for the peninsula. Stage three is the implementation. Plans and policies will be reviewed in this stage and put into practice. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, stage one is nearing completion. The information collection has been organised by a task force of seven people. Five members of the task force are located at the CYPLUS office in Grafton Street, Cairns, and another two work from Brisbane. The task force has done an outstanding job over the past two years. I have attended a number of informative briefings at the Grafton Street office and have been kept up to date on the progress of stage one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task force's commitment to public participation has been exemplary. It has been matched by the enthusiastic response of all the key community groups representing the major interests in Cape York Peninsula. These community groups have played a crucial role in the development of the strategy and I congratulate all the groups on the commitment to the process. These groups comprise the Cape York Land Council, the Cape York Peninsula Pastoral Advisory Group, the Cape York Peninsula Development Association, the Cairns and Far North Environment Centre, the Cook Shire Council, the Port Kennedy Association and the Queensland Mining Industry Council. These organisations have all been contracted to liaise with their members and each other to provide direct input into the task force's information gathering process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was an understandable suspicion of the CYPLUS process when it was first established. Unfortunately, there is not a long history of genuine community consultation by government in Queensland, especially with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island groups and conservation groups. The CYPLUS has involved a complex process&mdash;some have said too complex&mdash;with the Queensland Office of the Coordinator-General playing a key administrative role. I praise the Commonwealth's role in this process, as do most of the groups concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, some groups have accused the Queensland government of some delay. It is not my job in this speech to get stuck into the Queensland government, but it is important that there be no further delays. The aims of the CYPLUS are too important for any further delays. Delays have affected all the community groups. I strongly urge everyone to get together and get the process moving. That is not to say that the CYPLUS has not made great achievements. As the member for Leichhardt, I have dealt with all the participating groups on a regular basis. Over the past year, I think it would be fair to say that all the feedback has been 90 per cent positive. There has just been some complaint about delays. The Queensland bureaucracy ought to get on with the job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, stage one of the process is information collection. An outstanding range of information has been collected and collated for input into the geographic information system, or the GIS, computer. There are two main information collecting programs&mdash;the natural resource and analysis program and the land use program. The natural resource analysis program is a scientific research program, collecting and mapping broad scale information on the natural resources of Cape York Peninsula&mdash;its geology, soils, ground water, vegetation and fauna. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are 19 research projects being carried out by the state and Commonwealth agencies, coordinated by the CYPLUS task force. The budget for the program is $4.7 million. The natural resource analysis program started during the dry season of 1992-93 and will continue during the wet and dry seasons of 1993-94, with final reports to be completed by June 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Teams of researchers are scouring the peninsula, doing wetland surveys, documenting fish and crustacean species, examining the evolution and character of the coastal environment, measuring changes in the earth's magnetic field over the peninsula, mapping ground water and mapping the distribution and types of insects, flora and fauna. All available scientific data on the peninsula is being collated and put into the GIS computer. When all the information is collated, the GIS will provide storage and a means of analysis of integrated information which can be used to build a land use strategy for the Cape York Peninsula. It will be a phenomenal chore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second information collecting program is the land use program. This program will utilise information from the natural resources analysis program and combine it with social and economic data to provide individual reports on topics such as fire, land degradation, tourism, pastoralism or population and to provide overall reports on the state of the economy and the environment and the needs of people and their aspirations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once the land use program is completed we will know more about the Cape York Peninsula than we do about any other region in Australia.

For the second time at the end of one of his speeches I had absolutely no notes. Even if I was collecting only notes to attack what was said, I have nothing to attack here at all. The honourable member spoke about a proper and orderly development, which is a lovely motherhood statement. We can stand up and report ad nauseam a series of motherhood statements, but let us get down to practical facts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that actions in this place by the government of the honourable member and by his government in Brisbane have created a great Berlin wall&mdash;not of a social or political nature, such as the Berlin Wall, but one  of  an  economic  nature&mdash;stretching from Townsville all the way up to Bamaga and almost all the way down to Normanton. The Cape York Peninsula and part of the east coast down to Townsville is now surrounded by a giant Berlin wall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we want to understand the significance of that, we should look at the Century mine, which has the biggest zinc deposits ever found in the world's history&mdash;I think that is a fair enough statement; I do not think I am overly representing the resource&mdash;that is to have a slurry pipeline to take its product from the mine site itself to a port. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The length of the slurry pipeline will be&mdash;I cannot quote the exact figures&mdash;about 150, maybe 200, kilometres to the Gulf of Carpentaria. To get to that area it will need to go through a number of areas that are under some form of Aboriginal title. As a result of the media and the expectations placed on people there by the Queensland government, and because of attitudes that have developed unfortunately over a protracted period, they are fairly adamantly indisposed to allowing that pipeline to go anywhere near their land. Even the proposed surveying group that would look at alternative sites was not allowed on the Doomadgee Reserve at all. The net result is that the pipeline probably has to be diverted to Karumba. That is an extra 150 to 200 kilometres at an enormous cost of millions of dollars for every five or 10 kilometres of pipeline to the project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I tell the story to indicate the difficulties that are involved now in developing any of these resources because of the great Berlin wall which has been placed around North Queensland. The Century deposits have been held up&mdash;I venture to suggest that hold-up is very serious&mdash;for a protracted period. In times of normal zinc prices, the Century deposits are worth to this country $100,000 million a year. Similarly, the proposed development at Weipa would result, in times of normal aluminium prices, in nearly $1,000 million a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, in those two developments alone, both of which have been held up in part or in toto as a result of the Mabo legislation which was passed in this House and the concomitant moves by this government and its sympathy with that sort of thinking, the net result has been that at the present moment $2,000 million worth of development income per year for this nation is lost and could be lost completely. I have my doubts as to how these people will proceed in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Shelbourne Bay with its silicon sand deposits is an interesting case. If we want to know why our country is going broke, we need look no further than Shelbourne Bay. The last time I looked, which was a few years ago, we were exporting silicon from this country for $55 a tonne. However, when I was in the Queensland government, one year we imported back nine tonnes of silicon as optical fibre product into Australia and we paid $3.03 million a tonne for it. It was 99.98 per cent silicon, almost pure, when it went out and it was pure silicon when it came back in. If we want to be technical, we are exporting the same number of molecules of silicon out of the country as we are importing into the country; they have just been rearranged. But the rearrangement has been worth over $3 million a tonne to the Japanese economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the present moment we are producing hundreds of thousands of tonnes of silicon and exporting it from Cape Flattery, which is north of Cooktown. But, when an Australian developer attempts to develop the resource at Shelbourne Bay, he is told he has environmental problems; he has Aboriginal problems; he has Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority problems; and he has Beach Protection Management Authority problems. In fact, he has so many problems that we can forget about the resource completely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that resource in the two-inch thick, very heavily documented proposals I saw, which were the mining proposals for that area of Shelbourne Bay&mdash;the Australian owned lease, I emphasise, at Shelbourne Bay&mdash;was to produce 100,000 to 200,000 tonnes of high-tech silicon at about $20,000 per tonne per year. Even though I think some of those figures can be a little optimistic, there is no doubt that we are talking here about a facility that will be worth $2,000 million a year to the Australian economy. So the giant Berlin wall that has gone up around Cape York Peninsular has resulted in the stopping of the Century development, the Weipa development and the Shelbourne Bay development, each of those projects being worth $4,000 million a year to the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just come back to Shelbourne Bay for one moment. There cannot, by definition, be a green issue involved with the big dune at Shelbourne Bay which is owned by the Australian company. It is blowing into the ocean. We have the navigation charts which designate that dune as being a certain height at the turn of the century; it is now only half that height. One does not have to be Albert Einstein to work it out. The leading end of the dune is now protruding about 50 or 100 metres into the Pacific Ocean and dissipating on the ocean floor from which it cannot be recovered. There is no issue here. Within 70 years there will be no dune at all; the whole dune will be gone. This nation will have forgone an income of $2,000 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, Australia could project itself by producing high quality silicon. We could produce it far more cheaply than any other country. Because our original resource is 99 per cent pure silicon, instead of having to go through five processes, we would only need to go through three processes. Then, because we are able to do that, we will be able to produce a silicon product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those who are very environmentally conscious, let me state that this nation would automatically become the world leader in solar energy because we could produce photovoltaic cells at about half their present cost. We would cut the cost of the entire input item, which of course is silicon, clean in half. Solar energy, at this point, through photovoltaics, is competitive at peak hours in the middle of the day but far from being competitive overall with coal fired power stations. However, most certainly, at peak hours we could achieve a similar pricing structure to that provided by the coal industry at present. </PARA>

I say in defence of the black people on Cape York Peninsula that every time a development has gone ahead, it has been at their expense. The mining companies have not made the effort to try to provide something for the locals. Heaven only knows, when Charters Towers was given a choice of having a uranium mine there or not having one there, when we were told we got the pollution but Townsville got the jobs, needless to say, that community rose as one and completely defeated the project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, that is the case with the black people. I hope I have some small contribution to make to the black people of the peninsula in trying to educate them as to how to proceed. I told them to market themselves aggressively and negotiate aggressively. At the end of the day, I ask this House to please understand that we are dealing with intelligent people who have their own concerns. If there is something in it for them, I can assure the House that the majority of them will be in favour of the project, but if there is absolutely nothing in it for them, they cannot be convinced and, naturally, they will object to it. Those are the things that we should be addressing. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Secondly, his speech was full of the usual paranoia and scaremongering that we have come to expect of every speech the honourable member makes in this House. He made no positive contributions with regard to the very valuable work that is being done in the Cape York land use study. In fact, he started bringing in all sorts of other issues that were totally irrelevant to the matter, as he well knows.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In one of the major parts of his speech, he went on about the Century mine. He claimed that, because of Aboriginal interests in that issue and their concerns about the pipeline that was proposed to be built, somehow this project is being stopped. What he failed to tell us was that the Century mine is not in the Cape York land use study area; it is under the Gulf of Carpentaria. In fact, it is not even part of the study that we are talking about in this motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also made comments that were quite incorrect. He claimed that $4,000 million worth of government projects have been stopped because of Aboriginal, environmental or other concerns. That is a total untruth. That is a total distortion of the facts. None of these projects have been stopped. The Weipa project has not been stopped, nor has the Century mine. Yes, they are having to deal with certain issues that the Aboriginal communities have raised and they are having to deal with environmental issues, but that is the purpose of this Cape York land use study. The whole purpose of the study was to bring all interested parties together, to study all the issues involved and to make sure that every interest group involved on Cape York has their views known and taken into account. Current and future needs on the Cape York Peninsula can be properly planned to take account of all the different interest groups and all the different factors, such as protection of our environment, protection of Aboriginal sacred sites and their other interests, the protection of pastoral interests and the protection of ordinary residential interests in the Cape York Peninsula. </PARA>

If he had his particular constituency's interests at heart, he would be fully embracing the Cape York land use study because it is designed to protect the constituencies that the National Party claims to represent. Of course, National Party members fail to represent them because the government represents pastoralists, farmers and miners better than they will ever do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is about time the honourable member started to take account of the real interests instead of getting up here claiming that he is there to protect his constituents and making ludicrous comments about a giant Berlin wall being built around Queensland. There have been more development projects and more jobs created in Queensland than in any other state in this country. That has been under the Goss Labor government. It is certainly a hell of a lot better than what his government was able to produce in the 30 years that it was in power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to mention a particular element of this Cape York land use study, and that is with regard to Aboriginal and Islander interests. As the House knows, I chair the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs.

The Aboriginal and islander part of this Cape York land use program will be managed by the task force and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander interest group.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to join my colleagues in speaking on this motion. I note that I am the only non-Queenslander speaking, so I might bring a refreshing viewpoint to the debate. I remind everyone that we are talking about an area of land about the size of Victoria which, as the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd) has pointed out, has a population of around 11,000 people. It is a very large area of land with a relatively small population. One of the primary objectives of the Cape York Peninsula land use study must be to find out the values, needs and aspirations of those residents and also to ensure the sensible, long-term sustainable use of Cape York land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time I have available, I want to talk about one particular group in this region: the cattle producers, the pastoralists. Having met some of them, my concern is that they are being very much overlooked in this whole study. I noticed that the honourable member for Leichhardt mentioned the delays that have been going on. I would suggest that these delays are part of the very significant problems. It is creating uncertainty. It is obviously making it very difficult for people to see where their future is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about around 100 families&mdash;a very small but, nonetheless, significant number. More importantly, this group has the potential and opportunity to make a very significant contribution to our economy. My concern is that the cattle producers' views are being very much overshadowed by other groups, such as the environmentalists' views and some of the Aboriginal interests. I think it is vital that in this study the economic, cultural and ecological interests are balanced and not tilted very heavily one way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, there are areas of environmental sensitivity. Obviously, there are areas of strong cultural significance for Aboriginal communities. But, very clearly, there are also significant areas in this very large area of land of great potential for agricultural development. It was estimated in 1989 that the turn-off by these 100 cattle producers was around 16,000 head of cattle. That is far below the levels that used to be maintained in the past. Unfortunately, that trend of decline has been continuing. But now technology is available that could not only reverse this declining trend but also make massive increases in the productivity and the level of production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Technological improvements that would be able to cope with the physical constraints and the difficulties of high rainfall that sometimes, while reliable, is highly seasonal could be of major significance. As I said, the turn-off was around 16,000; it could be increased to a quarter of a million head of cattle per year which would produce a gross income of $80 million&mdash;a tenfold increase on the current position. The technology is there and the opportunities are there but, because of this uncertainty and delay, the surface is not even  being scratched. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At least 80 per cent of the land used by pastoralists would be left in its natural state, and 20 per cent of it would see some pastoral improvements in this regard. Obviously massive gains could be made through technology. We would have to have proper access to roads and to finance. Obviously there would have to be some changes in government policies to allow this development. But I think it is very important for this group to be given proper credit for the work it is doing. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)notes that Parliamentarians for Global Action (Australian Parliamentary Group) supports the initiative to request an advisory opinion from the World Court on the illegality of the use of nuclear weapons;</PARA>

<PARA>If anyone seriously doubts the value of this course of action in calling on the World Court to declare nuclear weapons illegal, let me quote the words of Mr Niall MacDermot QC, a former Secretary-General of the International Commission of Jurists. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be naive to imagine, in the present state of world tension, that a declaration of the illegality of the use of nuclear weapons, even if made by such an authoritative body as the World Court, would lead the nuclear nations to eliminate them from their strategy, still less to agree at once to abandon them. It would, however, mark an important step forward in awakening the peoples and governments of the world to the extent to which modern military weapons have outrun all the basic concepts of the international law of war, as well as all morality and humanity.</PARA>
<PARA>Anyone knowing the history of nuclear weapons will realise why this motion has been moved today. While many people remember the 1980s as being swept with greed, it was also a time which saw an explosion in the number of nuclear weapons possessed by countries around the globe. In 1945 there were two nuclear bombs in existence; 41 years later in 1986 there were nearly 70,000 nuclear weapons in active operational forces. That is an enormous amount of destructive force in anyone's language. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently there are nearly 50,000 active nuclear weapons in the world. In conventional terms this represents 2.2 tonnes of TNT for every person on the planet. There has been a healthy reduction of 20,000 missiles over the last eight years. However, there are still far too many. These 50,000 missiles have a total explosive fire power equal to 900,000 Hiroshima bombs. The Hiroshima bomb, dropped in the last days of the Second World War, killed an estimated 140,000 people. If one nuclear bomb killed that many, how many would 50,000 missiles kill? We now know that modern bombs are 75 times more powerful than the one dropped on Hiroshima. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United States has 16,750 nuclear weapons; the Commonwealth of Independent States retains almost twice that number. Great Britain has 200; France 525; China 435, and India, Pakistan and Israel are all believed to have nuclear missiles. These figures are more than just numbers or statistics; they reflect a capacity to absolutely annihilate our species and all others on the planet, and such statistics should horrify any reasonable person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To prepare for nuclear war the United States spent $38 billion in 1993 and, over the next 10 years, will spend $350 billion. Just imagine how else that money could have been spent. If other nations' expenditures are included in this charge for mutually assured destruction, it would add up to an extraordinary amount of money that could have been better used to eliminate poverty, illiteracy and disease throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the end of the Cold War, security considerations have become more difficult. There is, in fact, a greater mood of uncertainty as to what global security arrangements will be in place in the 21st century. One security option that nations should not revert to, and in fact should not be allowed to revert to, is that of obtaining and using nuclear weapons. Security and certainty will not be found where nuclear weapons exist. They promote fear and escalate violence and they should be banned by international law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many prevailing examples of how nuclear weapons are creating a disturbing uncertainty around the globe. Everyone in the House is aware of the crisis currently unfolding on the Korean peninsula. North Korea is refusing to allow United Nations' agents to inspect its nuclear facilities. North Korea is a signatory to the non-proliferation treaty but refuses to allow compliance checking. In response to this recalcitrance, the United States has deployed patriot missiles to South Korea in case the north fulfils its warning that it will consume the south with fire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Ukraine government is holding out on dismantling former Soviet nuclear missiles in the hope of receiving greater United States financial aid. No nation should be allowed to hold the rest of the planet to ransom with nuclear weapons. Closer to home, both India, which exploded the nuclear bomb in 1974, and Pakistan are believed to have a nuclear arsenal. Regularly we have witnessed tensions between these two nations and both have recently substantially increased their conventional weapons holdings in the form of new jets. That tension is still a cause of great concern for the rest of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of the Gulf War in 1991 it was estimated that Iraq was only one year away from developing a nuclear bomb. What would have happened if Saddam Hussein had managed to obtain one? No doubt we all remember how he fired Scud missiles on Israel. What if they were nuclear missiles and what if Israel then decided to reciprocate by sending nuclear missiles? We would have had an enormous outpouring of nuclear weapons around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our world is full of complexities and conflict. Many of the disputes present us with an incredible, frightening reality. While many of these disputes are complex, solutions must be found which avoid the use of force. Peace must be sought as a first resort, not at the end of the battle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nuclear weapons must be eliminated before they are able to eliminate us. That is why this motion has been moved today: to ensure that nuclear weapons are banned. Other weapons of mass destruction are now forbidden, such as biological and chemical weapons. All members will be aware of the role Australia played in seeing these conventions negotiated and implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The World Court project to declare nuclear weapons illegal is a joint project of the International Association of Lawyers Against Nuclear Arms, the International Peace Bureau and the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War. The aim of the project is to obtain an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice at The Hague, colloquially known as the World Court, as to the criminality of nuclear weapons in international law. The International Court of Justice was established by the UN charter and the court may give advisory opinions on any legal question at the request of any body authorised by or in accordance with the United Nations charter to make such a request. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993 the World Health Assembly, which is the governing body of the World Health Organisation, referred to the World Court the question of whether the use of nuclear weapons was contrary to international law. In November 1993 a motion was tabled to seek a somewhat wider ruling on whether use or the threat of use was illegal. This was eventually withdrawn following heavy pressure from the United States, the United Kingdom and France. However, the case put forward by the World Health Organisation is now proceeding. Written submissions have been requested and need to be lodged by 10 June 1994. The hearings are not expected to take place until 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A group of parliamentarians in this parliament who are called Parliamentarians for Global Action, which is an international parliamentary assembly, are calling on the Australian government to support this proposal to be taken to the World Court. We ask the Australian government to make a submission to the International Court of Justice supporting the aims of the World Court project to declare nuclear weapons illegal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present position of the government is not to support bringing the case before the World Court. In a letter dated 4 May, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, outlined the Australian position on this initiative. He says that he supports what is known as stable deterrents, which rely on the belief that horrific outcomes of a nuclear confrontation are enough to dissuade it from ever happening again. It also advocates continuing progress towards disarmament by the nuclear weapons states through treaties in which Australia will seek to play a central part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is suspicious that the World Court may actually find that the use of nuclear weapons may be acceptable in some circumstances, such as in retaliation to a first strike or in response to a massive conventional attack. My concern is that this line of thought belongs to the era of the Cold War. We have moved on from the Cold War and we need to change our policy to reflect that. Nuclear deterrents should not rely on the grotesque premise of stable deterrents but on collective security through an assertive security council involving the cooperation of all nuclear powers. It is unlikely that the court would legitimise the use of nuclear weapons but, even if it did, the principles of international law as they exist in the 1990s would have to be articulated for public consumption and understanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's present position should be changed because it assumes that the views of the nuclear weapons states are the authoritative voice of humanity. However, it is because of the policies of the nuclear nations that an advisory opinion should be sought in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This country, under Labor, has been more independent in its international outlook and dealings than at any other time in the nation's history. However, a few legacies of reliance on our great and powerful friends remain. We should be capable of taking a principled and moral decision on the legality of nuclear weapons and articulate it before the rest of the world.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No-one can doubt the obvious sincerity of the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) in wanting to achieve a safer world&mdash;if not for ourselves, certainly for our children. Regrettably, the coalition cannot support the motion in its present form for good reason. The reason is that the quest to ban nuclear weapons would be adhered to if it were enforced&mdash;if it were law&mdash;by the very countries striving to prevent irresponsible countries from using nuclear weapons to gain ascendancy over other innocent people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition strongly supports any move to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. That can and is being done through treaties, such as the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the comprehensive test ban treaty. But the coalition cannot support moves to declare nuclear weapons illegal because, terrifying and repugnant as those weapons are, nuclear deterrents do work and have worked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thankfully, nuclear weapons have not been used in a war since 1945. That is because nuclear weapons held by countries such as the US, the former USSR, the United Kingdom, France and China possess a strategic nuclear capability sufficiently credible to deter an exchange of nuclear weapons. That is a matter of history as well as a matter of fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present government, of which the honourable member for Moreton is a significant member, does not agree with the honourable member's point of view on this particular matter. Successive Australian governments of all political colours have agreed to host military facilities which play a significant role in the strategic nuclear capability of the United States. If we were in government&mdash;we will be after the next election&mdash;we would continue to do so because the possession by the United States of a credible strategic nuclear capability is a key factor in preventing global nuclear wars. The coalition does not believe that our quest for peace in the world and the efforts of organisations such as the United Nations should be made illegal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like everyone in Australia and in the free world, the coalition heartily wishes that nuclear weapons did not exist. We hope that one day that situation will, in fact, occur. We do not believe, however, that having the World Court declare these weapons illegal will in fact make them disappear. The leadership shown by the United States in the last few years in achieving agreements for disarmament and for the destruction of nuclear weapons by that nation and by others is having a significant effect on the quest by all of us to achieve a safe world and to rid ourselves finally of nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were to make a judgment by passing this motion, all we would do is embarrass and hinder our ally, the United States, as well as other countries which are working very hard to achieve peace and safety. It would have absolutely no impact at all on those countries which seek to acquire nuclear weapons in defiance of the international nuclear non-proliferation system&mdash;and the honourable member for Moreton mentioned North Korea in his own contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just imagine the Saddam Husseins of this world responding to a declaration by the World Court that nuclear weapons are illegal. Just imagine, as the honourable member for Moreton said, what would have happened to those innocent people in Israel if Saddam had rained on them missiles with nuclear capability to achieve his territorial and strategic claims. He did not have them because of the non-proliferation agreements&mdash;agreements that do work, even though they do not work as effectively or as quickly as we would all like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Saddam Hussein would have no respect at all for a declaration of a court making these weapons illegal, although our allies, such as the United States and the UK, would of course comply with those orders. The world would be less safe simply because many people in this world, such as the Saddams, do not respect the law. They certainly do not respect international law; they respect only the law that their own power and tyranny can bring upon innocent people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The end of the Cold War has dramatically reduced the threat of global nuclear war&mdash;and I think my friend the honourable member for Moreton concedes that point. As a result, the United States and Russia have significantly reduced their nuclear arsenals. In particular, they have withdrawn inherently destabilising nuclear weapons such as warheads on short range ballistic missiles and seaborne cruise missiles. With the threat of global nuclear war diminished&mdash;but not, it must be stressed, eliminated entirely&mdash;it is the proliferation of nuclear weapons that now poses the greatest nuclear threat to regional peace and hostility. I think my friends would agree with that statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">North Korea, which has been mentioned already, is strongly suspected of developing nuclear weapons, and is developing ballistic missiles capable of delivering them onto targets in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and China&mdash;our allies, our friends and also our strongest trading partners under our ASEAN and other world trade arrangements. Why would this parliament wish to inflict on those friends of ours further danger from the threats that come from North Korea today by forcing allies to rid themselves of nuclear weapons that are kept only as a deterrent? I am sure that the honourable member for Moreton would not suggest that the United States of America, our ally, holds its remaining nuclear weapons as a threat against the world. I am sure that it is common ground on both sides that they hold the remaining weapons as deterrents against the aggressive use of nuclear weapons against the free world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore the coalition regrets that, for the reasons that I have explained, it cannot support this motion. But the coalition takes this opportunity to emphasise and recommit its support for all international mechanisms aimed at preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and its belief that such mechanisms should be strengthened wherever possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We support the indefinite extension of the nuclear proliferation treaty. Honourable members might be interested in taking note of that. The treaty comes up for review in 1995&mdash;a short time away. We support accelerated work on a comprehensive test ban treaty. We support the missile technological control regime. And we support very strongly the work of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Building international support for these international treaties and organisations and ensuring compliance with them is our best hope for containing nuclear proliferation. </PARA>

They are not my words; they are ex-President Bush's words. He obviously had some experience on this matter, and he claimed `Nuclear weapons are infinitely more dangerous'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, the headline on the front page states `N Korea rejects nuclear checks'. Some of us are putting forward the suggestion that if nuclear weapons were illegal we could go in and check them, but by not supporting this motion we cannot do that. All we can do is stand off and take information from the CIA. That is quite interesting. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the CIA has said that the communist North's extensive missile program is part of an effort to prove that its nuclear arsenal can strike all the major cities in Japan and Korea.</PARA>
<PARA>If I remember rightly, the CIA was involved in the start of the Vietnam War. I would hate to see what could come out of this. I say to all leaders of all nations all over the world, `Just be a bit cautious in anything you get from the CIA and anything in relation to North Korea. It is a dangerous situation which could lead us into another war.' I will just read out some information to honourable members from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Defence Monitor</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. U.S. nuclear weapons were designed and produced to counter Hitler's Germany&mdash;they go right back to that time&mdash;Hirohito's Japan, the Soviet Union, Mao's China and the Warsaw Pact. These enemies no longer exist.</PARA>
<PARA>So why do we need those weapons? It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. The United States is the world's number one military power, with or without its huge arsenal of nuclear weapons, and can attack any target with its vast array of powerful nonnuclear weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. Nuclear weapons do far less than constructive economic and political relations with other countries to prevent attacks on America.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. It costs American taxpayers $31 Billion each year to buy, operate and maintain U.S. nuclear weapons and weapon delivery systems.</PARA>
<PARA>It later states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The military of the United States is far superior to the armed forces of the regional "bad guys" . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The USA has 20,000 nuclear weapons; Iran has zero, as far as we know; Iraq has zero; Libya has zero; North Korea has zero; and Syria has zero. All of those countries may have one or two nuclear weapons, but we do not know. The countries that I have named are the bad guys, yet the US has 20,000 nuclear weapons. That is a big difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nuclear weapons serve no military purpose, especially given the US's superiority in conventional weapons. The United States is the world's No. 1 military power with or without its nuclear weapons. Many military officials have recognised that they no longer need nuclear weapons and have deliberately sought to build up stores of powerful, smart non-nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Did all the nuclear weapons prevent the Vietnam War,  the  Korean  War, the Cambodian War or the Iraqi War? They did not prevent any of those wars because they could not be used. They are worthless. People say that they are a deterrent and that they might stop a war in some other country. But look at all the enemies. Russia has disintegrated. It is not an issue any more. Why do we need nuclear weapons? The only reason we need them is a huge, powerful lobby of some people in the US, the UK, France, et cetera, which is putting pressure on us to support them. We should put forward a motion in the International Court of Justice to oppose and ban nuclear weapons. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While acknowledging the good intentions of the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) in moving this motion, I feel it is not a reasonable response to the nuclear weapons issue. Seeking an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice would be about as effective as some of those `nuclear free zone' signs we have seen around some of the local councils which have cost ratepayers money. While not being flippant, I wonder what a direct hit from a nuclear weapon would do to some of those signs. This motion is really in that vein.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I acknowledge the concern of the honourable member for Moreton and the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth), because I know that theirs is a longstanding concern. But the honourable members know that international law is not a fixed, immutable code and that any judgment on the legality or otherwise of nuclear weapons is of little practical use, particularly where some maverick nations are involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is no doubt that the proliferation and possible use of nuclear weapons remains an issue of great importance to the international community. As honourable members may be aware, the publication entitled the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</EMPHASIS> displays a clock on its front cover depicting the latest estimate of how close the world is to global catastrophe. In some of the more heated moments of the Cold War, this clock stood very close to midnight. Thankfully, it now stands further away. According to the May-June edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</EMPHASIS>, the clock stands at 17 minutes to midnight. This change in the world's nuclear circumstance has been brought about largely by the end of the Cold War and the welcome and rapid collapse of communism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be tempting to think that the decline in the rivalry between the West and the East has meant that the risk of nuclear conflict has disappeared. Nothing could be further from the truth. With the end of the Cold War, new concerns and worries have replaced old, not least in relation to the use and proliferation of nuclear weapons. We may no longer have to worry greatly about the risk of a nuclear first strike from the Eastern bloc. However, today we must be concerned about the increased possibility of low level nuclear threats and nuclear proliferation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The world cannot discount the possibility of accidental or unauthorised limited nuclear strikes. No amount of well-intentioned legal argument at any forum will be enough to prevent a holocaust. In relation to the former USSR, there are several scenarios in which an accidental launch of nuclear weapons may occur. Poorly maintained weapons or faulty command and communication structures could be a source of risk for accidental launch. Other possibilities include the provision of incorrect or misinterpreted information to the nuclear command. We must also consider the danger of unauthorised nuclear strikes. Examples include the maverick general who has command of nuclear weapons, the mad submarine captain or the terrorist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concern has been expressed about the possibility of rogue elements in the former USSR, including Mafia style criminal organisations, conducting nuclear terrorism. These scenarios have long been subject matter for popular fiction, but these nightmares could well become a reality. The President of Russia, Boris Yeltsin, obviously shares this concern. At a recent conference of the successor organisation to the KGB, the Federal Counterintelligence Service, President Yeltsin urged the service to be vigilant about the threat of nuclear terrorism. The director of the FBI, Louis Freeh, believes that the interest of Russian organised crime in selling nuclear weapons or materials stolen from the former Soviet republics is the greatest long-term threat to the security of the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Australia would also do well to consider the danger of nuclear terrorism. Thankfully, experts believe that the chance of unauthorised nuclear launch from nations of the former Soviet Union is remote at this time. However, should the top state structures of these nations ever collapse, we cannot be sure that nuclear launch codes and other necessary information will remain in safe and sane hands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An example of the potential danger is the present tension between Ukraine and Russia, both nuclear armed states, over Crimea. Associated Press recently reported that the Russian defence minister, Pavel Grachev, has warned that a military conflict in Ukraine could spark a civil war engulfing the rest of Ukraine. Of course, the former USSR is not the only source of nuclear risk. For some time there has been a concern about nuclear armed Third World nations. Proliferation of nuclear armed Third World states has the potential to increase the risk of accidental or unauthorised strikes. Proliferation also increases the chances of possible panic situations and may mean that future conflicts could result in nuclear blackmail. North Korea and its possible nuclear arms building plans may one day prove a case in point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While personally believing that the motion is not an appropriate response to an issue of global concern, I respect the intention of the honourable member for Moreton in submitting it to the parliament. I am not wishing to play the role of scaremonger in this debate. However, it is my firm belief that the world, including Australia, must take into full account the current and potential nuclear forces of the post Cold War era. I urge the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) to consider what Australia can sensibly do in the international arena to ensure that nuclear conflict never occurs on this planet. </PARA>

<PARA>The ardour with which Australians from all spheres of life&mdash;all tiers of government, political parties, community groups, church groups, industry groups, trade unions, even vice-regal personages, and, of course, the inevitable social engineers&mdash;have taken up the gauntlet on behalf of the family in this International Year of the Family is in itself proof of the universal realisation of the importance of the place of the family in Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This crucial family role is a fact which some members in this place, notably some on the coalition benches, have been fully aware of for years. We have also been aware of the fact that, increasingly, government policies, particularly those of the Labor government over the past decade&mdash;although not solely these&mdash;have resulted in a gradual and gruesome assault on what has traditionally been the backbone of society. I refer once again to the millions of families which make up the bulk of the Australian population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are those, like Ms Jennie George of the ACTU executive, who wish to believe that `the family is a relic of the past'. Such people say that only 15 per cent of the population live in the traditional or normal family&mdash;a statistic based on families made up of married couples with two children. It does not include couples without children; couples with one child; couples with three, four or more children; couples with grown-up families; brothers and sisters sharing a home together; couples with children who share a home with grandparents; or sole parent families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, contrary to the protestations of Ms George and her ilk, 85 per cent of people in this country actually live in a family situation. The picket fence is still the norm, not the bizarre exception. However, what is happening behind the picket fence is a different matter and in many instances a great cause for concern. Marriage breakdown, spiralling divorce rates, the apparent escalation of domestic violence and child abuse, and the increasing number of street kids are some illustrations of society's malaise vividly portrayed in the news media on a daily basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be more specific, according to the Salvation Army report of 1993, 40,000 families are expected to become homeless by the end of 1994. There are 800,000 children living in homes where neither parent is employed. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the divorce rate is now close to 40 per cent of the annual marriage rate. Over 5,000 children aged between five and 17 years were sexually abused in 1993. Almost 5,500 in that age group were physically abused in that same year. This is probably a very conservative estimate, because we are dealing only with reported cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the fact that a number of surveys have shown strong support for family values&mdash;such as the South Australian survey conducted by McGregor Marketing in May 1993 which showed that 78 per cent of the people in that state support a return to traditional family values&mdash;families are increasingly under threat. Obviously, judging by the statistics quoted previously, it is the children who suffer the most. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Don Edgar, the recently retired Foundation Director of the Australian Institute of Family Studies, believes that children have insufficient time with their parents and that little effort is put into stimulating their first crucial years of development. In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 22 January this year entitled `Children are losers in modern family life: expert', he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People tend to forget that divorce disrupts children and that divorce produces poverty for women and children, and both of these are very damaging for children in the long term.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a view shared by the general public. A recent child-care survey commissioned by the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS>, which was published last month on 11 April, established that child care is no substitute for the love and attention of a mother in the home. More than 80 per cent of respondents criticised formal child care and many said that it broke the special bond that should exist between mother and child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This survey was published at about the same time as similar findings were documented by Ms Helen Leach in her book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Children First</EMPHASIS>. Ms Leach maintains that children should be cared for by parents until the age of three. On 18 April, the National Secretary of the Australian Family Association commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The mother is really best placed to give that one-to-one interaction the child requires, but the government still discriminates against mothers who choose to stay at home.</PARA>
<PARA>The Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Brian Burdekin, warned on 14 April of the effects of `an even greater abuse of children brought on by the pressures resulting in the breakdown of the family unit'. He said that Australia had `totally failed' many of its young people. He found that de facto arrangements where the father was not the natural parent had resulted in the occurrence of sexual abuse of children rising by 600 per cent. He believed that the steep rise of single parent families in Australia to between 400,000 and 500,000 was leading to children being unable to cope, committing suicide and having other associated problems. Mr Burdekin went further to describe as `a disgrace' the fact that every young male prostitute on The Wall in Darlinghurst was a ward of the state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the Governor of New South Wales, Rear Admiral Peter Sinclair, was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> of 19 April as voicing his concern on the fate of the average Australian family. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the International Year of the Family, we have no reason to feel complacent about what we have done to the family, with every third marriage failing and alternatives to a conventional family unit&mdash;which are less ideal for the raising of children&mdash;now widespread and accepted, even encouraged within our society.</PARA>
<PARA>The vocal minorities referred to by the governor have been dominating political debate in this country for too long, but they would not have such influence without the strong support of government, especially the federal Labor government that has existed over this past decade. This is a disgrace, but an equal disgrace is support given to it by the media and the entertainment industry which, at the same time, have done much to denigrate traditional family values which, over the centuries, have been the basis of holding the family together. The average night's television entertainment often comprises far more the bizarre, the seamy, the ugly and the violent than the wholesome. Sexual depravity is the norm and marital fidelity is non-existent or scorned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> article of 26 April entitled `In reel trouble', Ronald Conway makes the same point about the film world with his subtitle `Ordinary people are under siege as Hollywood spins out of control'. Mr Conway refers back to the Hollywood of yesteryear when `wholesomeness was not a target of ridicule and patriotism was not a dirty word'. Mr Conway believes that conservative critics such as Michael Medved could be right when they say that the industry seems to have declared war on mainstream suburban life. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Traditional families are presented as crawling with vicious repressions, terrorists are portrayed as freedom fighters, military commanders as fascists.</PARA>
<PARA>This comprehensive assault on the integrity of the traditional family is continuing to have devastating effects in Australia and elsewhere. Research by the University of Illinios in an analysis of crime in 171 United States cities showed that the divorce rate was a reliable predictor of the robbery rate. In 1992, Canadian research found that sons often turn to crime when their parents break up. The 20 March 1993 issue of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> points to Princeton University research showing that children from broken families are more likely to drop out of school, the girls are more likely to have a premarital birth in their teens and the boys are more likely to be unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A damning indictment of the effect of the absence of a committed father is contained in a 1992 publication entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Families without fatherhood</EMPHASIS> by Dennis and Erdos. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Physical weight, height, educational achievement, criminality, life and death itself are on average connected with the presence or absence of a committed father.</PARA>
<PARA>In Western Australia in 1992, statistics from the Longmore Remand and Detention Centre involving 409 young people showed that less than 20 per cent lived with both their parents and 75 per cent did not live with their fathers. The evidence is overwhelming that the traditional family environment is the one which is best suited to the rearing of children. I, therefore, call on all political parties in this House to promote policies which, in accordance with the wording of this motion, weld the family together and sustain it through adverse circumstances; in the taxation area positively discriminate in favour of the family; and, in the operation of the Family Law Act, emphasise reconciliation where possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion is a good indicator of the confusion facing the Liberal Party in the 1990s. It is trying to work out whether it is a conservative party or a liberal party in the classical sense. From this motion the judgment to be made is that it is a very conservative party, even reactionary. Implicit in the motion is the assumption that a traditional nuclear family is the only family around which government should make policy. The Liberal Party in the 1990s believes in only two families&mdash;the nuclear family and the royal family. That is a great problem it has in its policy making. For people who are not married, who have a wife that works, who have not got dependent children, who are engaged in a homosexual relationship or who are part of an extended family, they take no part in Liberal Party thought or policy. No party can appeal to a broad range of Australians in the 1990s when it focuses on a minority of Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) confirmed, this is a motion with a white picket fence. This motion confirms how inadequate the Liberal Party has become in terms of understanding social change and understanding the proper role of government. Government responds to the choices that individuals make, it backs those choices in and supports them with effective government policy and programs. There is no role in our society for a government to impose on people its image of good family life. That is exactly what this conservative party tries to do. This is an exercise in social engineering. It takes what it regards as a good model of a family and says that every Australian family should fit the model and if it does not something is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures quoted by the honourable member for Deakin are virtually meaningless because the root cause of any problem in our society is social disadvantage. If we take any disadvantaged community the figures for marriage breakdown will be higher, as they will for many other social problems. The Liberal Party has no understanding of cause and effect. This motion shows that it has no understanding of the way in which social problems arise and the way in which they can be corrected. Further, the motion does not recognise the immense diversity of Australian society and family types in the 1990s. We cannot talk about family values in a meaningful way unless we recognise diversity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The term `family values', which is a throwaway line in politics, has become an empty piece of rhetoric. What does it stand for? The only thing it can stand for is to recognise that family types, structures and individual choices are so diverse that we cannot pinpoint one set of values for all people in society and act as the basis of government policy. This motion shows conclusively that we cannot go back to the future. We cannot go back to an Australia where the majority of families consisted of the nuclear family structure&mdash;the male working, the wife at home, dependent children, the picture of the Queen on the wall, and children singing `God save the Queen' every morning. Those opposite cannot go back to that because Australia has gone way past that. Australia has moved past, while the Liberal Party and its thinking have stayed rooted in the 1950s and 1960s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no set formula for families. One need only look at the figures to understand how families have changed and evolved through the years. There are three main sources of change. There are fewer people married and staying married than ever before. In 1975, for instance, 15 per cent of marriages were preceded by a couple living together. In 1993 that figure was 60 per cent&mdash;by choice, by individuals making a choice about the lifestyle that best suits their needs and preferences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One-parent families in 1982 comprised 7.75 per cent of all family types. That figure in 1992 was nine per cent. The important thing to understand is that one cannot stereotype the one-parent family as being a teenage mum, because teenage mothers comprise only three per cent of one-parent families in Australia. Eighty per cent of one-parent families are people in the age group 25 to 49 who have made a choice to divorce or to break their de facto relationship. It is their choice to make; it is not for people in parliament to lecture them about their free individual choices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Births outside marriages have increased from 13.7 per cent in 1982 to 24 per cent in 1993. The honourable member for Deakin refers in his motion and his speech to the divorce rate. He should be congratulating this government if he really believes in what he is saying because divorce in Australia per 1,000 married population has come down from 12.5 per cent in 1982 to 11.5 per cent in 1993. The divorce rate under this government is down. So if he believes his rhetoric about family values and the importance of the traditional nuclear family, the motion should congratulate the government for the fall in the divorce rate. In truth, the government can take no credit because it is not the role of government to say to people, `You shall divorce' or `You shall not divorce without reconciliation', as implied in the motion. It is not the role of government to make those decisions. Individuals should make those decisions. They are not to be stood over by social engineers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other change is that more women are working. The labour force participation rate for women has increased from 41 per cent in 1973 to 51 per cent in 1993. Government policy should be framed around that movement, around the preference of women in the 1990s to find work according to their own choice and personal preference. As a proportion of all couples in Australia, the number of partnerships where both partners work has increased from 42 per cent in 1982 to 53 per cent in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has to recognise also the growing diversity of Australian society. The Liberal Party is never comfortable with migrants or multiculturalism. The reality, however, is it is more likely for a multicultural community to produce extended families, particularly with some of the southern European and Asian migrants coming to Australia. One also needs to recognise the diversity of Aboriginal family structures and homosexual couples. We know what the Liberal Party thinks about homosexual couples in Tasmanian law. It thinks that states rights are much more important than human rights. When one listens to the honourable member for Deakin one can understand why. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own electorate of Werriwa there are 130,000 people, and 27 per cent or, 35,000, of those people, according to the 1991 census, live in the traditional nuclear family. That is, not even a third of the people in my electorate fit the criteria and outline set by the honourable member for Deakin in his speech and motion. That is why the motion is flawed. Setting policy around such a small part of our society is inevitably flawed. Government must support the lifestyle choices of individuals. If government cannot do that, it lets down the country and those individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am happy to report that this government has been supporting the choices of individuals and those social trends. Social security policy has given support to sole parents. Additional family payments have been made for low income parents. We have ended the discrimination against women through income splitting for social security and the outstanding initiative in the white paper of the parenting allowance. The number of child-care places has increased in support of working parents from 46,000 in 1983 to 237,000 in 1994. That is an increase of 400 per cent, backing in the choices of women to break the models set by the honourable member for Deakin&mdash;a model rooted in the 1950s&mdash;and to take their rightful place in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the measures proposed by the honourable member for Deakin. He is saying that we should weld families together. What about choice? What about the choice of individuals to find their own family structure and to find their own family values instead of fitting the stereotype that is being proposed? He says that we should positively discriminate in the taxation system in favour of nuclear families. In my electorate discriminating in that fashion would mean discriminating against the 73 per cent of people in Werriwa who do not fit the stereotype. It is a bad type of discrimination that discriminates in the minority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Deakin goes on to say in his motion that the Family Law Act should proceed only with reconciliation&mdash;reconciliation ahead of divorce. What is the role of government? Is the role of government to say to people, `We know more about your relationship than you do'? If people have made a free, adult choice to divorce, should government come in and say, `No, go back to the drawing board.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This year, the International Year of the Family, is an invaluable opportunity to address some of the issues facing families in Australia at this particular time. It is quite ironic that this debate has been brought on by the opposition in the debate on private members business. It is the first time this year that the International Year of the Family has been mentioned in this chamber and the first time there has been any debate on the subject at all. All the raving by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) about what his government is doing about this matter is such that the government is not so proud of it to even bring on a debate, make a ministerial statement or even raise a question in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we hear from the honourable member for Werriwa is the continuation of the great lie about families in Australia and it indicates the problem of talking about families. The honourable member for Werriwa constructs a straw man which he can then strike down by saying that only 15 per cent of families constitute whatever his traditional family is. That depends on the parameters he sets for the traditional family. If he wants to set parameters which say that only one parent can be working and that a family has X number of children, they are the parameters he is setting. The reality in this country is that 86 per cent of all families are couple families. If we look at the practice and the aspirations of ordinary Australians, despite all the doom and gloom we have had from sociologists and experts in the past two decades, we see that they are practising normal, conventional family life. Most of them are proud of it and most of them aspire to it. Even when they fail, they aspire to it again, which can be seen in the large number of people who remarry following divorce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We get this notion that anyone who wants to speak about the conventional family&mdash;as if it were something of a relic of the past&mdash;is in some way intolerant or is being prescriptive. We are talking about what is the norm for ordinary Australians&mdash;conventional family life&mdash;and that is something which some of us are going to stand up and say more about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statistics quoted by the honourable member do not make sense either. It is certainly the case that more couples live together before going into marriage, but the great majority of them then marry. The honourable member talks about 25 per cent of children being born out of wedlock as if that is something about which we ought to be proud. The United States, where the figure is now 24 per cent, has had three congressional inquiries over the last three or four years to deal with what Republican and Democrat alike have identified as being the major social problem facing that nation. Yet we have this nonsense from the honourable member for Werriwa, who says, `It is okay, we do not have to worry about it.' The honourable member quotes the divorce rate as falling from 12 to 11 per thousand. Where did it start about a decade and a half ago? It was four per thousand. The honourable member can quote statistics saying that we have a great fall from 12 to 11 per thousand. That is a threefold increase over the last decade and a half, so it is hardly anything to be proud of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the time we are being told that in no way can we define a family and in no way can we say that there is anything ideal about the family. All we have to look at is the practice of ordinary Australians. Eighty-six per cent of all families are couple families. That is their ideal and that is what they aspire to. It is about time we stood up and said, `Yes, what you're doing is deserving of encouragement' and not put forward the sort of nonsense we have had from the honourable member for Werriwa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had Professor Cass, the chairman of the IYF council, running around this country saying that we cannot define a family and that there is no such thing as an ideal family. This is an interesting notion from Professor Cass because I searched the library for some of her writings and I can quote what Professor Cass once thought was a family in Australia. She stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no great difficulty in defining the family in contemporary, Western, industrialised society: the husband, wife and their children, the "nuclear core" living as a separate unit in its own residence.</PARA>
<PARA>This is what Professor Cass once said about the family, but she now turns around and says that there is no ideal and we cannot talk about what a family might be. If we cannot talk about an ideal or an objective in terms of family policy, then we can have no policy itself because the notion becomes meaningless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time is limited, unfortunately. There ought to be some hours given to this subject in this place and not just the few minutes which have been given. The reality is that, over the last decade, ordinary families have suffered economically. A decade ago the top one per cent of earners in Australia earned as much as the bottom 11 per cent; whereas now the top one per cent earn as much as the bottom 21 per cent&mdash;a doubling in that group made up of the poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Statistics prepared by Anne Harding at the university here in Canberra indicate that families with children constitute the poorest group in Australian society. One can go on and on and on with the statistics. The reality is that, under the government of those opposite, ordinary Australian families became worse off in the 1980s. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am amazed that the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) seems to blame the federal government for marriage breakdown and the dissolution of families. The federal government over the last decade has ensured that social services are geared to help families deal with the many problems of society's changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Society and its values are quite different from those that existed just after the Second World War. Technology, transport and education have changed. Even the definition of a family has changed. Families are even broader now. At a time of immense growth after the war many young couples could afford to make a home for themselves rather than live with parents, and the definition of a family was seen then as a male, a female and two children. The male was the breadwinner and the female the homemaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not surprisingly really, many men came home from the war to find work and displaced many of the women who had carried out those tasks while they were away. The range of employment was more limited than it is now. The male would have done his apprenticeship or have started with an employer when he was 15 or 16 and then continued with that employer all his working life. There were opportunities to start at the bottom of a company and work one's way up. Public transport was the main transport for most working people and the motor car was used for recreational purposes. Education was geared for a range of jobs that were available for the young coming out of school or for entry into apprenticeship schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How different it is today. The male is no longer seen as the breadwinner. Both partners often contribute equally and there is an expectation that each shares equally in family responsibilities. Work has changed. The hours are shorter, the pay greater, but the security is less. Contract workers no longer have the ability to control how long they stay working for one person. It is often left up to the demand and the success of a business. The age of certainty is finished. There are no tariff barriers and we have market driven wage increases. Remember when wages were set on the needs of a family by arbitration? The other side of the House cannot argue for market economics and deregulation on one hand and then say these matters do not affect family life or change society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Young people need more training. Companies no longer want someone to start at the bottom and work up. They want workers who slot into specialised areas that require off-the-job training. With education comes information. People are not prepared to accept work and home conditions that they have put up with before. They know things can be better. Couples are more careful about marriage than they used to be. They marry when they are older or they do not marry at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian social trends in 1994, compiled by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, reveal that between 1982 and 1992 the number of single men getting married fell from 55 per cent per thousand to 41 per cent per thousand. People still want to share their lives with a partner, whether they are married or not. The number of de facto couples increased by just under 50 per cent between 1986 and 1991. This study exposes the myth, the belief, that teenage mothers are the prime source of children born outside marriage. Births from mothers aged under 20 fell from 7.2 per cent in 1982 to 5.4 per cent in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea of marriage has changed, too, along with the concept of the family. Families can be defined as those in a household. There may be no blood relatives or it may mean a mother, grandmother and child. It may mean a father and son or it could mean two single parents getting together to share costs. A family means that there is someone who cares for you when you need help, to share joy and sorrow and assist you to survive in an ever increasingly changing world. People are more mobile; they travel more and experience other cultures. Australia is fortunate to have people from different cultures arriving in this country all the time and has benefited greatly from them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the last session I drew the attention of this chamber to a kit that has been circulated amongst secondary schools entitled `Paying tax'. This kit is designed to encourage secondary students to learn all about paying tax before they have learned about earning a living. The other half of this story is that the federal government is now trying to turn teachers at these secondary schools into bounty hunters.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, the government never remembers that it ought to be paying some compensation to the poor businesses that have to keep collecting tax.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity to congratulate the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) on his appointment. This is my second set of congratulations. It is a great honour to be chosen by one's party to lead it. In our political system, unlike some democracies around the world in which the government is in a sense opposed or shadowed on a daily basis, where there is a recognised personality who would be the Prime Minister or head of the government, the Leader of the Opposition is a very significant position in our political system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot wish the Leader of the Opposition too much luck&mdash;he will have to make that for himself&mdash;but I can say on behalf of all members on this side of the House that we do look forward to a genuine policy debate. It is worth recording that Australia has come a great distance in the last 10 years. There has been a greater propensity for reform in this country than in certainly most OECD economies in both economic policy and social policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we all know, given the fact that we are now trading into the world and we are competing with the motor economy of Japan and with strong economies like China's, the need for change and reform will be upon us.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the House expresses its deep regret at the death on Wednesday, 18 May 1994, of Sir John Oscar Cramer, Minister for the Army from 1956 to 1963 and Member of the House of Representatives for Bennelong from 1949 to 1974, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</PARA>
<PARA>John Oscar Cramer was born on 18 February 1896 at Gaspard, Quirindi in New South Wales. One of six children, he was educated at the local Gaspard Public School. After leaving school at the age of 14, Sir John worked on the family farm and then managed a small family owned fruit shop in Quirindi. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1917 Sir John moved to Sydney, where he was offered work with Paramount Pictures Film Exchange. In 1920 Sir John and his brothers, Charles and Roy, set up a small real estate business on the North Shore in Sydney. Those who knew him knew that he retained his interests in this business well into his retirement. Prior to entering federal politics, Sir John was actively involved in local government, holding significant positions including Chairman of the Sydney County Council and Mayor of North Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir John is recognised as one of the co-founders of the Liberal Party. He was heavily involved in the push for the establishment of a Commonwealth-wide party and, while his efforts earned him as many enemies as it did friends, they were rewarded in 1944 when Sir Robert Menzies launched the Liberal Party of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the age of 53, Sir John sought and won pre-selection for the federal seat of Bennelong and was voted into office in the 1949 federal election. He professed to being an incurable addict in relation to public matters and gained immense personal satisfaction from public life.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although there were many things about parliamentary life which frustrated him, he felt greatly privileged to work with men and women who in his opinion were imbued with an inner spirit of service to their fellows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the federal election of 1955, Sir Robert Menzies appointed Sir John to his ministry as Minister for the Army. He retained that portfolio until 1963 when he chose, at the age of 67, to return to the backbench. From 1 March 1950, Sir John served as a member of the Joint Committee on Public Works and chaired the committee from 1954 to 1955. He also served as a member on the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs from 1970 to 1972. He led an Australian delegation to the 14th Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference in the Bahamas in 1968 and was an observer at the South Pacific Conference in Fiji in 1970. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Queen's Birthday honours list in 1964, he was knighted in recognition of his long and valuable service in the interests of his country. His political career continued until he retired from parliament in 1974 at the age of 78. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir John's life was not without personal tragedy. He was predeceased by his son, John, who died in 1964, and his wife, Mary, who died in 1984. In the true form of his generation, which lived through some of Australia's toughest years encompassing World War I, the Great Depression, World War II and the period of postwar reconstruction from 1945 to 1950, Sir John served his country well. He will be remembered for his unceasing efforts in public service and for the political contribution he made at both the federal and local levels of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Few members in the House are contemporaries of Sir John Cramer. I happen to be one of them. I got to know him quite well. We used to share parliamentary offices in Sydney. In those days, we used to all go to the Commonwealth Bank cafeteria for our meals. He would hold court most days and give stories of federal politics and personalities. For anyone who has not been here, things were different before 1975. They changed in atmosphere substantially after that time. Before then, there was a substantial degree of fraternisation amongst members. None have brought me more pleasure than the conversations I had with Sir John Cramer. He was a very decent individual and a very nice man. Everyone who knew him liked him. On behalf of the government, I extend to his family our most sincere sympathy in its bereavement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition wholeheartedly supports this motion of condolence for Sir John Cramer. Sir John Cramer's record of community service and his work for the political values in which he believed left an indelible mark of achievement on his fellow Australians. His passing will be mourned, particularly by those he loved, but also by all those in whose service he worked so hard and for so long. Members of his family, to which he was utterly devoted, will feel his loss above all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In sending them our sympathy, we know that they will be sustained and comforted by the knowledge that, for Sir John, they were always the centrepiece of his life and that they provided him with the real motivation and support for his lifetime of achievement in commercial and public life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many others will mourn Sir John's death. They include his many business associates, all those who benefited from his work in so many community organisations, all those he represented for so long in the federal electorate of Bennelong and many others who were grateful for what this great Australian did for his local community and his country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I want to focus on what the passing of Sir John Cramer means to my party, the Liberal Party, and why his life and work are so inseparable from our party, whose founding owes so much to him. John Cramer and his family were an example of what hard work and dedication to duty could achieve in a land of opportunity. They were part of a true pioneering spirit of old Australia which built the strong foundations on which so much has subsequently been achieved. John Cramer's record of service to the Liberal Party is a record of how the party began, how it attracted people of drive and talent, how its appeal grew and how it became the dominant political force in postwar Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Cramer's career was living testimony to the Liberal commitment to duty, family, individual worth, initiative, freedom and social obligation&mdash;all values which were a driving force in Sir John Cramer's life. John Cramer typified many of the people who actively supported the United Australia Party in the 1930s and early 1940s and who played a central role in the founding and growth of the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Cramer was a person who placed a high importance on public duty. He was a person who had achieved personal success through his own hard work, who overcame many difficulties and who had a great love for his country. He was a person who believed that Australia's success had been built on private enterprise and individual freedom and who wanted to ensure that those principles were always advanced. He was a person who totally rejected the notion of socialism in Australia, which the Labor Party at the time strongly advocated and which he saw as a fundamental threat to Australian democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Cramer was also a person with a very clear view about the social and moral values which he saw as fundamental to Australia's past successes and essential if Australia was to realise its full potential in an economic as well as a social sense. For him, an unshakeable commitment to family life, loyalty to principles and a strong moral code were the foundations of a strong and secure Australia. John Cramer and so many of his generation were inspired by these beliefs and values. As such, they were drawn to the liberal-conservative tradition of Australian politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Cramer was a man who was never content with stereotyping. He was a man whose achievements in life reflected his own family background and his own drive to succeed. His grandfather came to Australia from Germany and, with very little to support him, toiled hard in rural New South Wales to build a better life for his family. In his memoirs, John Cramer describes his own childhood on his father's farm near Quirindi as very poor in terms of money but rich in terms of happiness and family life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Cramer and his family were also strongly and proudly Catholic at a sectarian time in our history when being so had its costs. It was from this background that John Cramer came to Sydney in 1916 with #4 in his pocket and hope in his heart. He decided, with his brothers, to establish&mdash;from scratch&mdash;a real estate business in the northern suburbs of Sydney. In doing so, he experienced all the highs and lows of struggling to establish a small business. His courage, determination, integrity and business acumen guaranteed the success of his venture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To a record of growing business successes in the real estate and building industries, John Cramer added an expanding involvement in political and community life. In the 1930s and 1940s he became the Mayor of North Sydney and, later, Chairman of the Sydney County Council. In both offices he achieved great advances in community service and great support and recognition for the role of Australia's service personnel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Cramer had a long and active involvement in the United Australia Party in the 1930s. He became one of the very early advocates of the need for a nationwide party in the liberal conservative tradition to replace the UAP. He became convinced that such a vision would only be realised if UAP figures in New South Wales took the initiative. On most Thursdays throughout 1943, John Cramer gathered with those who shared his vision in the Blue Room Cafe in Rowe Street, Sydney, to discuss how a new national party to oppose Labor could be formed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Withstanding the pressure from UAP diehards in other parts of Australia and the manoeuvring from other groups, such as the Commonwealth Party and the Liberal Democratic Party, John Cramer and his colleagues worked tirelessly to convince the New South Wales branch of the UAP of the need to change, and ultimately succeeded. That success led to the founding of the Democratic Party at the 1944 state election in New South Wales and ensured that subsequently a genuine nationwide party in the liberal conservative tradition was both necessary and inevitable. It was Robert Menzies who galvanised this new political mood, who brilliantly outmanoeuvred Labor in the late 1940s, and who proved a leader of unmatched skill and durability in Australia's political history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of creating the momentum for the founding of the Liberal Party, it was a small group of visionaries in New South Wales who were of critical importance and the work of John Cramer within that group was absolutely vital. John Cramer became an early member of the Federal Council of the Liberal Party. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said, he won the seat of Bennelong when the Menzies government was swept to office in the famous 1949 election and he held that seat continuously until he retired in 1974 at the age of 78. He served as the Minister for the Army from 1956 until 1963 and helped to forge a wide range of regional defence associations which have been built on in the decade since. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Cramer was an integral part of a coalition government which rebuilt the foundations of postwar Australia and provided good and stable government for many years. But his legacy to the Liberal Party lies in much more than the high offices that he held and the length of service that he gave. His true legacy lies in who he was and the vision that inspired him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the Liberal Party deeply regret that Sir John Cramer will not be with us later this year for our 50th anniversary celebrations. His personal qualities and values, as well as his own achievements and commitments to the wider community, epitomise what our party stands for. At a difficult time in the history of Liberal and conservative politics in this country, it was John Cramer who had a bold vision of what we needed and the courage and determination to help ensure that vision was realised. He was a man who knew and overcame much prejudice in his life. He treated others on the very Christian basis of what they believed and how they acted&mdash;not what school they went to, what formal education they had or what religion they belonged to. He expected others to treat him the same, and his success in business, community and political life was on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir John Cramer has an honoured place in the history of the Liberal Party. He also has an honoured place in the hearts of many Australians, particularly those in his local community whom he served in so many capacities. John Cramer belonged to a generation that saw a special honour in public duty and community service, and his achievements in both will benefit Australians for generations to come. With his passing, the Liberal Party has lost one of its founding stalwarts and the Australian community has lost a man who did so much to improve it. I commend this motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a privilege to rise in support of this motion of condolence for the late Sir John Cramer. I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the new Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) in that regard. As the Prime Minister pointed out, Sir John Cramer was born last century on a farm in the Quirindi district. His life spanned some 98 years of remarkable change. The Australia of 1994 is a very different place from the Australia of 1896. For example, in place of the once a week mail delivery in Quirindi, we now have faxes, mobile phones, radio, television and a twice a week mail delivery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some things that will never change and, in particular, certain aspects of Sir John's farm upbringing will endure forever. In his autobiography entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Pioneers, Politics and People</EMPHASIS>, Sir John reflected on both the fond and funny memories and the hardships of those early years on the land. He said that he would never forget:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the periodic droughts, the need to cart water to keep stock alive and for domestic purposes, the ravages of grasshoppers, butterflies and insects, and the plagues of locusts and mice. Then there was damage by rabbits, the sudden hailstorms and the heavy, biting frosts . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, it is a sad irony that on this very day, as we speak in support of this condolence motion for Sir John Cramer, there are too many farmers across the southern half of Australia facing those rigours which are once again due to the severity of a savage drought. While the challenges may have shifted slightly, there can be no doubt that a farm upbringing teaches you about the very essence of life&mdash;the hardships, the joys and the ups and downs it brings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the lighter side, Sir John recalled his father's interest in racing dogs and, in particular, his champion dog with a rather politically incorrect name. I will not tell members of the House its name. They can look it up. He recalls how the district carnival races in those days used live hares and even cats as lures for the dogs. They would take a dog a quarter of a mile down the paddock and would then release a cat about 100 yards from the nearest protective shed. The result may have been bloody to see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the early 1990s Sir John developed his conservative political leanings. He developed his confrontationist style at school and later in parliament, and often observers compared it with that of a bull at odds with a gate. His country upbringing gave him an understanding and close friendship with members of the then Country Party and particularly with people like Sir Arthur Fadden. As the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, in 1916 John Cramer moved to Sydney and began to pursue his interests in real estate, Paramount Pictures and other business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the onset of the Great Depression and its devastating effect on people's lives, Sir John began to consider political solutions to Australians' problems. After a period as Mayor of North Sydney, Sir John, as one of a group, including Sir Robert Menzies, moved from the United Australia Party, the group holding a special conference in Canberra. The delegates then assembled in Albury, in the electorate of Farrer, in December 1944 to approve unanimously the decision to form a new Australian party&mdash;and so it was that the Liberal Party of Australia was born. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A good illustration of Sir John's tenacity is that at a branch meeting in Bennelong in his electorate he was asked, `Mr Cramer, do you owe your allegiance to the Pope or to the King?' The question was disallowed, but Sir John jumped to his feet saying that he wanted to answer it anyhow. In his reply he said that it was an insult to be asked such a question as he was a loyal citizen of Australia and as a Catholic he thought it was not anyone's business but his own and it had nothing to do with the Liberal Party or with politics. His answer was greeted with applause. Thankfully this question would not be asked today, reflecting how things have changed. We can well do without this kind of sectarian politics and prejudging of people on their upbringing and background. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He once tried to explain to an outsider what it was like to be in parliament. He told that person to imagine that there was a fellow with a machine-gun behind every bush and that one had to steer oneself through this hazard to make progress in parliament. That is possibly about right. Sir John was critical of parliament and believed that there was much room for improvement. However, he quickly pointed out that he also held the Australian system of government in very high regard. He thought the great weakness in a human being was the desire to pass the buck. He once said that everyone wanted to blame the other fellow. He made that point in respect of governments, politicians, bosses, unions, workers, companies, the press and even husbands and wives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I draw the attention of the House to the last page of comments Sir John made in his autobiography. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All human beings should feel responsible for themselves, for their actions, for their decisions. They should also be entitled to the benefit of their own effort and their right to justice under the law of the land.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to join the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) in this condolence to John Oscar Cramer, the first member for Bennelong between 1949 and 1974. To live to the age of 98, no matter what your politics, your religion, your nationality, is a remarkable achievement. He predated the Commonwealth of Australia. There were three great influences in his life: his family, his strong Catholic faith and his highly successful business activities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was different from many parliamentarians now in that he entered parliament as a remarkably successful businessman. He retained his business pursuits throughout the whole time he was in parliament, and at the age of 78 when he left parliament he returned to those business pursuits with great gusto. He was a very good local politician. He was highly regarded on the lower North Shore and, in fact, was patron of many clubs on the lower North Shore until the day he died. He was a regular at smokos at places like the North Ryde RSL right up until he died. He was very much one of the formative influences on business, and small business development in particular, on the lower North Shore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition has already documented the contribution that John Cramer made to the formation of the Liberal Party. He held the seat of Bennelong with one near fright in 1961, when Harry Jensen ran him to within 300 votes in the credit squeeze election when Arthur Calwell was Leader of the Labor Party. Apart from that he held the seat very comfortably through that 24-year period. I found him a person possessed of a very robust sense of humour. It was once said of him that when he was Minister for the Army and was reviewing a passing-out parade on a large parade ground he turned and said, `General, this would make a remarkably good subdivision.' He was a person who preserved his interest in real estate matters and in small business throughout the whole of the time that he spent in politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was in a sense a person who came before the age of career parliamentarians, although he himself had a very long parliamentary career. He followed the path that is not followed quite so frequently now of people who have a long tutelage in local government or semi-government instrumentalities and then go into federal parliament. That seems to be more of a rarity these days than it was in the 1940s and the 1950s. He belonged to that unique brand of Australian Liberals of having been a 49er, somebody who came in with that great blush in, as the Leader of the Opposition reminds me, a good year indeed&mdash;I say to the Leader of the Opposition an absolutely vintage year of 1949. But he did belong to that very special breed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He is remembered with great affection in his electorate. Those who attended the mass for him at St Marys in North Sydney represented the entire spectrum of Australian politics. It was appropriate that two of the mourners at his funeral were the former Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam and Lady Sonia McMahon, the widow of the former Liberal Prime Minister Sir William McMahon, of whom Sir John Cramer was a very close friend. On behalf of the electorate of Bennelong, I record my gratitude and that of the people of Bennelong for his long and dedicated and committed service to the people of Bennelong. We send our sympathy to his family. We celebrate a remarkably long and robust life and express our great admiration for the contribution that he made to those values that he held dear and to the people of Australia. </PARA>

As I said to the family on the day&mdash;they too were quite amused&mdash;I was one of the earliest people on this side of the House to hear from the Leader on Sir John Cramer's funeral day. But we did not say anything to anybody else who was there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir John Cramer was one of the founders of the Liberal Party who will go down in Australian history as a great man, not only as the member for Bennelong, but for the total public spiritedness and real activity of his 98 years. The present member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), who has himself celebrated his 20th anniversary in this place, gave an outstanding eulogy to Sir John. It merely remains for me to pay tribute to the great impression he made on me&mdash;and he certainly did. His son Erle has had a medical practice in my electorate for many years and still lives down there. I have maintained a family connection over a very long period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not plan to repeat what has been said about Sir John already in this tribute, but I must say, as I said to the family on the day, that I have been heartened by the fact that Sir John was 78 years old when he retired from his very active life as the member for Bennelong. The fact certainly gives me great hope and a certain further ambition. But I must correct one difference I have with the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer): for 78 of Sir John's 98 years he was interested in dealing in land, not farming it. I think that should be recorded in this tribute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir John Cramer taught me the precision of punctuality. His family, grandchildren and great grandchildren will understand when I say that when we shared taxis for years from the hotel to the airport&mdash;we had to share in those days&mdash;he would reprimand me every time I was 10 seconds late. However, he was a much greater man than such trivialities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too am one of that small band of people who had the honour to have association over some years with Sir John Cramer. He was in every sense of the term a big man. He was a big man in the political sense and certainly in terms of his community involvement. In the Sydney City Council he set a standard for borrowing funds overseas, which I think would be to the credit of any Treasurer in the Australian parliament at present. He did outstanding work as Mayor of North Sydney Council and also as the federal member for Bennelong. On page 222 of his biography, which happens to be the last page, he made the point which I think was emphasised very clearly by other speakers here today:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The complete human being must also have compassion for his fellow man and get great happiness out of a spirit of giving rather than receiving.</PARA>
<PARA>Throughout his life Sir John Cramer set an example of community spirit. He set an example of what the individual could do for the community in the wider sense of the word. It is interesting in that context to note that he claimed that throughout his life, especially his public life, he had carried three crosses. The first was his real estate occupation, the second was his German ancestry and the third was his Catholic faith. It must be remembered that he was in public life throughout the period of the Great War, as well as the Second World War. Consequently, we can see the difficulties he would have had at that particular time, having a German name. Reference to his Catholic faith has already been well documented by my colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also true that during the 1930s through to the 1950s, Australian politics was unduly affected by sectarian divisions. Just as the Australian Labor Party clearly had a substantial number of Catholics within its midst, it also followed that in the conservative parties non-Catholics made up the majority. Nevertheless, Sir John was the first to break that mould. Others followed him to the extent that today, the Liberal Party is truly a universal party which covers people of all faiths. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth noting that Sir John referred to the need to have a national conservative party, though based in the Burkean liberal tradition, which would bring within itself all components of the Australian community. For example, I am sure he would have taken great pleasure to know that in his own state of New South Wales we have in Helen Shan-Ho an Australian-Chinese member of parliament&mdash;the first for this nation. I hope we will see in future years a greater expansion of the coverage of the various ethnic communities within this parliament so that the Liberal Party can be the inclusive party which Sir John played such a substantial role in creating in the years between 1941 and 1944. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I send my sympathy to his family. I think I should finalise my remarks by making the point that, a few days before his death, an ABC television crew interviewed Sir John over a number of hours to take on record the substantial contribution he made to the creation of the Liberal Party of Australia. That will be his testament to this great year, the 50th anniversary of the party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support this condolence motion. Sir John Cramer represented many thousands of residents of my electorate on the lower north shore over the years. He was probably the most dominant figure of the lower North Shore for most of the 20th century. That is not an exaggeration. He was an alderman of the North Sydney Council for 10 years, councillor of the Sydney County Council for 14 years and the federal member for Bennelong for 25 years, fighting his way through 10 very controversial elections. On two occasions it was very close: the election in 1961, which the honourable member for Bennelong has mentioned, and again in 1972. He also ran a very successful but very controversial real estate agency in the area for nearly 60 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He had few setbacks although, as he pointed out himself, the three crosses he had to bear, I think, caused problems for him in local government. In 1941 he lost office after 10 years in the North Sydney Council. I think it was because of prejudice to his ancestry and the very great sectarianism that existed at that time. He was always a prominent figure, both here and locally. He was a physical giant and, for many who did not know him, he had a stentorian voice and he gave forth many forthright and controversial views. When the Whitlam government was elected in 1972, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are now living in Australia under a communist umbrella.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said in the same speech&mdash;and I think many in the coalition might still agree with this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No-one can deny that all the cranks, odd-bods, drug addicts, homosexuals, abortionists, pornographers, women's liberationists and all the demonstrators in the World were brought together to get Labor into power.</PARA>
<PARA>But, on the other hand, many in the government ranks would agree with his very forthright views on growth and development, particularly of natural resources. He was a very strong supporter of Arthur Calwell's immigration policies and the call to `populate or perish'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was a great orator right through to his nineties and gave many great speeches locally. I remember recently at the North Sydney olympic pool on its 50th anniversary he welcomed everyone to the pool pointing out that he was the owner because of the 25 names on the opening plaque he was the only one still alive. He still made the front pages of the local papers on regular occasions right up to the last few months. In the public arena, he was confrontational in the extreme, but personally he was a gentleman. While he gave me many lectures on my misdeeds at local, state and federal level, privately he was extremely helpful. I think he has left many legacies for the people of the area. His political views were certainly unambiguous and consistent, unlike those of most of us here. He lived with a very clear sense of personal and political values and had a life of amazing longevity and achievement, which is something to which we can all aspire. </PARA>

Need I say that the measures I announced in the white paper this month will build on those achievements by reducing unemployment, removing poverty traps and introducing the parenting allowance, which will mean that 120,000 low income families will receive on average an extra $59 a week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at the impact of the changes in the tax system and the social security system and the transfer of payments system, one sees that the picture in relation to the people who are in the lowest deciles of income in this country was dramatically improved. As I said earlier, household disposable income has risen every year the government has been in office because more people in households are in work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by making the following point. The question comes from the Leader of the Opposition, whose policy is to have no underpinning of award payments and conditions in this country. He would have a free-fall of wages, particularly seeing to beat-up on people on $360 and $370 a week. It is a shame that the Liberal Party has always supported these policies, but it is a double shame, in still supporting them, asking a question without any integrity.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the invitation of the British and French governments, I will participate along with heads of state and heads of government from other countries contributing forces to the D-day operations. I will be participating in ceremonies in Portsmouth, England, from where many of the ships departed and which was the location of the central planning headquarters, and also at several locations in Normandy associated with the landings and the campaign that followed them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The D-day landings were a dramatic attempt to gain a foothold on continental Europe from which Nazi Germany could be driven back and it is one of the best examples ever of successful international cooperation. It was primarily a United Kingdom-United States operation and most of the troops participating in the landings were from the United Kingdom, the United States and from Canada, but Australia also made a noteworthy contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All told, an estimated 2,600 Australian servicemen actually took part in the landings or the related air and sea operations. Australia's main contribution was through the RAAF, which had several squadrons under the empire air training scheme and which operated in effect as Australian squadrons. As many as 2,100 RAAF air crews were involved. Probably around 500 navy personnel were among those embarked on ships associated with the famous channel crossing. Some commanded some of the small vessels which typified the D-day landings and became such a powerful symbol of the struggle against Nazi occupied Europe. A small number of Australian army troops also took part.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians today probably cannot imagine the odds that these young men faced as they went into the battle against an enemy deeply dug in and solidly prepared against attack. Losses were high in the early days of the invasion and ground was won only after bitter fighting. Many of the Australians were subsequently recognised for the great gallantry and courage they displayed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia also made a substantial contribution to the war effort in Europe, again suffering enormous losses. More than 6,000 Australians lost their lives in the battle in Europe during World War II. Among those 6,000, 3,486 died while serving in Bomber Command&mdash;a casualty rate as high as that experienced by Australian soldiers on the Western Front in the First World War.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently received a letter from Rollo Kingsford-Smith DSO, AM, DFC, who was Commander of the 463 RAAF Lancaster squadron. Mr Kingsford-Smith believes that these Australian airmen have not received due recognition for their sacrifice, and I hope that during my visit I will be able to go some way toward rectifying this matter. It is worth quoting a word or two from the letter:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the terrible winter of 1943-44, the average command loss rate on each raid was 5.1 per cent and the first tour of operations was 30 trips&mdash;few survived. Young inexperienced crews coming into my squadron knew their death was almost certain yet their morale was always high and they fought the Germans and the weather with equal determination. Other Australian squadrons and Australians in RAF squadrons would all tell a similar story.</PARA>
<PARA>During my trip I will take the opportunity to pay tribute to the sacrifices made by Australia's service personnel both on D-day and in the European theatre of the Second World War. I will take the opportunity to visit the air forces memorial at Runnymede, not far from London, where I will also recognise the outstanding contribution of all our personnel in Europe. In Normandy I will visit a new memorial for the pilots who fought so bravely against such odds during the battle of Normandy itself.

Why is it, as the Australian Bureau of Statistics notes, that in contrast to the rapid recovery after the 1982-83 recession employment remained virtually unchanged over the two years following the trough of the 1990-91 recession?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister whom the Leader of the Opposition worked for inherited an unemployment rate of five per cent and left this government a legacy of 11 per cent unemployment. Let us just get that on the record. The then coalition government had appalling rates of economic growth and appalling rates of employment growth because it could not manage inflation and it could not manage the economy. I have said often in this House, and I will repeat it, that when this government took office in 1983 the sense of relief&mdash;not a sense of defeat but the sense of relief&mdash;on the face of coalition ministers that the problem had been passed to somebody else was palpable.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government will proceed with the land fund. It will do so for the simple reason that, though the Mabo decision of the High Court and the subsequent passage of the Native Title Bill introduced great measures of justice to the opportunities of Aboriginal Australians to reclaim their land, anyone who is even a moderate student of Australian history will know that the nature of Aboriginal dispossession was such that those who were dispossessed of their land will not have the opportunity to claim the opportunities under the native title legislation. That is, having been dispossessed of it, they cannot make the traditional connection which is required under the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was for this reason that the government said it would introduce a land fund.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I was very pleased to read in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> that the shadow spokesperson for Aboriginal affairs supports the formation of a national land acquisition fund to provide land and housing for dispossessed Aboriginals. I also remind the House that in the Aboriginal Land Fund Bill 1974 the first supporting speaker on the then government side was Mr Hyde, the then member for Moore.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has to ask: what is the basis of objection to the land fund? Is it a fiscal objection? It cannot be that, because the government only appropriates on the outlays that are actually expended on land acquisition and management. The rest is in the revolving fund. So it cannot be a fiscal objection. If it is not a fiscal objection, what then is the objection?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition knows that Aboriginal people, having been dispossessed, cannot avail themselves of the native title legislation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Mr Mercer has had a view&mdash;not obviously a representative view, but a view&mdash;about the budget and the only question can be the question of the marginally higher financing task of $1 billion or so in the non-appropriation of funding towards the white paper objectives. When one gets to the question of national economic efficiency, when one has to consider whether taking 320,000 Australians who have been unemployed for 12 months and more and retraining them and bringing them back into skills formation in this economy is a more efficient thing to do than the marginally lower financing task, leading possibly and of course unrealistically to a lower level of interest rates, there is no macro-economic judgment to be made.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I heard that indrawn breath and groan of dismay from those opposite, as well they might, because I draw their attention, and particularly that of the shadow spokesperson on this question, to the fact that nearly 19,000 Australians die every year from smoking related illnesses. It is not a matter for light-heartedness. It is 52 people every day. Some 70-odd per cent of drug related diseases are from tobacco related causes. In other words, it is more preventable death and disease than from any other drug.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lot of authoritative research on this. As opposed to the views of the honourable member for Mackellar, it has been going on for 30 years. She does not seem to have noticed it. She does not seem to have noticed either that some $9 billion a year is lost to the Australian economy because of this drug. Most of it is in health costs. The research that has been going on for the last 30 years&mdash;and I am quite happy to have a briefing provided for the honourable member for Mackellar&mdash;shows that tobacco is a significant factor in lung cancer, the deadliest cancer in the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tobacco has also been linked to cancer of the mouth, the oesophagus, the larynx, the stomach, the pancreas, the cervix, the bladder and the kidneys. I could go on. The honourable member for Mackellar clearly needs a lecture on this question. It is also a major cause of ischaemic heart disease, of circulatory disease, of high blood pressure, and of complications of pregnancy, including low birth weight. In fact, research that I undertook with colleagues showed very clearly that it had adverse effects on birth weight, muscle tone and reflexes of newborn infants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is shameful that for years tobacco companies were allowed to link cigarette smoking with images that promoted health, youth and fitness. It is a shameful position which I am pleased the opposition in its official policy has recognised should not continue&mdash;except for the honourable member for Mackellar, who apparently had not heard her own party's policy or the research. She wants to continue to let smoking be associated with those positive images. She wants the community to be denied the information that smoking causes illness and a slow and painful death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apparently the honourable member for Mackellar does not believe this information. I quote from her&mdash;over the cacophony of conservatives over there&mdash;that in her view the case has not been made out that cigarette smoking and tobacco are dreadful things. She is not certain about that. The honourable member for Mackellar says that `because tobacco is legal, it should be allowed to be promoted'&mdash;despite all the evidence I have just presented. Guns are legal. Should we allow those to be promoted too? Morphine is legal too. Should we be pushing that on television every night?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Mackellar is clearly wrong on this issue. The AMA told her so; the Heart Foundation told her so; her own party told her so. It is time she backed down on this question. She should retract her personal views&mdash;not least because they are ill-informed. Tomorrow, as part of Quit Week, is World No Tobacco Day. I know some of you might wish it was a `No Bronwyn Day', but it is a no tobacco day. It is a very important occasion for the honourable member for Mackellar to acknowledge her error and to correct it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the Liberal Party has had problems in developing a health policy, but what we have seen over the last few days is ridiculous. As I said on Friday, this would be funny if it were not such a serious issue. People are dying and the honourable member for Mackellar knows it. That is why I gave up smoking and that is why she gave it up. Why does the honourable member for Mackellar want to encourage other people to take it up?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I challenge the honourable member for Mackellar to stop ducking the issue and to stop running for cover. She should either retract her position or resign. The people of Australia do not want a health spokesperson who is so clearly an apologist for the tobacco industry. In conclusion, Mr Speaker, I draw your attention to one welcome change resulting from this debacle: the honourable member for Mackellar is avoiding television.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought that was a well-timed statement by the governor to remind people, particularly banks saying to borrowers that they can extend their debt, that they can take on other categories of lending under the collateral security of their home and lending at rates of 100 per cent of debt against properties was a timely reminder to the banking system, particularly the major banks, that they have a role to perform in business in this country&mdash;to do that which they should be doing and have a mandate to do&mdash;as well as in housing. The advertisements on television piling up the swimming pool and the holiday on top of the house are an indication of where the major banks stand. The regional banks, feeling that they are under undue competition from the four majors, are lending at 100 per cent financing and that is not wise for funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, you might recall that in the One Nation statement the government increased the rate of interest on non-callable deposits to commercial rates of interest which provided about $140 million worth of value to the banking system, in the main the major four banks. The purpose of that was to focus on business lending, and particularly small business lending, to improve manager-client relationships to give managers the capacity to peruse and understand balance sheets and to be able to make judgments about the bankability of a business and develop client relationships with that business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also a device in the early days of the recovery to cover some of any of the attendant risk of more prominent lending to small business. We are not seeing the levels of lending which I think the four major banks should be involved with. They say there is not the demand. But it is a chicken and egg situation; if they do not go looking for the business they will miraculously find there is not much demand. The fact of the matter is that housing has become an easy resort for lending for the major banks. As a consequence of that, it has been proven over the last decade that housing has a very low level of risk&mdash;and this is particularly so with the risk rates under the BIS conventions&mdash;the banks are lending heavily for housing. I think the governor's remarks about housing lending that he made privately to the banks and then the remarks he made, over the banks' heads, to the public about the attendant risk of heavy financings of up to 100 per cent of equity and adding to that, are timely. As to the interest rate implications, if we end up with a recovery of the kind we are seeing now with&mdash;</PARA>

Generally, when there is a demand for funds we will see some price effect. That is different from the price effect coming from inflation. I should underpin the governor's confidence and remarks about inflation. This should be taken notice of by the opposition which should at least wonder why that low inflation rate is there.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I have seen the report from the Australian Bureau of Statistics to which the honourable member refers. I am also very conscious of the abuse and misuse of the statistics contained in that report that have been made by various spokesmen from the opposition. The Prime Minister has already dealt with the issue of inequality, the impact of government policy and the fact that the figures talked about were in gross terms and failed to take account of the impact of the tax transfer system. Another aspect that has been emphasised by the opposition's spokesman on social security, the honourable member for Berowra, is the number of people supposedly on welfare. He said in a press release a couple of days ago:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a direct result of the Government's policies, which have had the effect of entrenching a welfare state.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very interesting proposition. Yes, there has been a significant increase in the numbers of people on various social security payments. That has been the result of a variety of factors. We have had an ageing population, which has led to an increase in the number of aged pensioners, from around 930,000 ten years ago to about 1 1/2 million now. There have been significant increases in the numbers of sole parent and disability pensioners&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Ruddock" NAMEID="0J4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr Ruddock</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And unemployment, of course. But the difficulty faced by the opposition when it has tried to attribute this to government policies is that the great bulk of that increase occurred during the period 1975 to 1983, that is, when the opposition was in office. That is obviously the case with the unemployment payments. As the Prime Minister has pointed out, we inherited a rate of unemployment close to 11 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Take the number of sole parent pensioners. This is a group that is constantly maligned by conservative spokesmen in our country&mdash;a group of people who need assistance, which we are providing through the JET scheme and in other ways. The suggestion has been made that government policy has somehow caused a massive increase. The fact is that from 1975 to 1983 the average annual rate of growth in the number of people on sole parent pension was 10 per cent. From 1983 to 1993 it has been three per cent. Again, if you look at all these categories of payments, you will see that the rapid acceleration occurred under your tenure. During the 1980s we have targeted the system better, we have introduced more effective compliance measures, we have improved the real level of benefit for those who really need it and we have produced a more efficient and effective instrument for the prevention of poverty in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point that requires emphasis is that you cannot just look at the absolute numbers of people on the various payments. A good proportion of people on the various pensions and benefits are on less than the full rate because of earnings from non-government sources, from investments and from personal exertion. One of the impacts of government policy over the past decade has been to significantly increase the proportion of people on various payments who are able to derive significant income from non-government sources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Take sole pensioners. The proportion of sole parents who are earning significant non-government income so that that reduces their pension payments has fallen. The proportion of sole parents receiving a full pension, that is, not having any other source of income, fell from 84 per cent in 1983 to 50 per cent in 1993. A similar pattern occurs in all the other payments: with the age pension it is the same thing; unemployment, the same thing; disability, the same thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been significant reductions in the numbers who are solely dependent on government payments for their income support. That is a deliberate consequence of government policy, of measures to reduce the barriers to work force participation, such as the JET scheme, the disability reform program and the unemployment measures. They have been taken a significant step further recently with the white paper measures that have been announced, including the job compact and the measures in that area. Also in the social security area we have redesigned the income support system to comprehensively remove disincentives to work force participation. That is the way to address this issue and get the numbers of people dependent on benefits down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In conclusion, it is rather extraordinary the way some of the opposition spokesmen have responded to this matter. We have been criticised for that redesign of the income support taper which removes those disincentives and those poverty traps. The honourable member for Mackellar, in an extraordinary newspaper piece two weeks ago, somehow accused us of changing the social security system in such a way as to entice people back into the work force and to induce people to report a higher proportion of their earnings and put it on the table.

I grieve because it is the taxpayers who are being forced to pay the price of the determination of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to buy himself victory at the next election, using assets belonging to all Australians. I grieve because it is becoming increasingly clear to me and to all of my constituents that it is the government's intention to sell off assets belonging to the taxpayers of Australia to create stopgap training programs and short-term employment under the job compact which was announced in the white paper on unemployment. The government is selling off the farm, piece by piece, with no long-term or permanent benefit to the people of this nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has already indicated that it is considering privatising Tullamarine airport, the AIDC, the Australian Industry Development Corporation, and a number of other major components of Australia's public assets. That may be fine; my party has a policy of privatisation of certain government assets. But the difference in the approach of the Keating government and our party is that we look for a permanent benefit. All of the policies of the Keating government have been short term: `Put a bit of bandaid over it, a bit of putty over the cracks, and let us move towards the next election.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian Defence Industries operates a heavy engineering facility in my electorate of Bendigo. It is more than likely that the 450 permanent jobs at that facility could be sacrificed in favour of temporary positions in areas anywhere in Australia&mdash;short-term jobs. The jobs that the ADI personnel hold down are in a high-tech, highly skilled defence area. They are permanent jobs in an industry which is internationally sensitive, and which is involved in strategic defence issues, including the manufacture of ordnance and armaments, yet they could be tossed aside to help this government create the illusion of growing employment. It really is an illusion because the white paper does not provide employers with any incentives to create new and permanent jobs. The job compact is merely an election ploy&mdash;a not so cheap trick, with $6.5 billion of taxpayers' money which the Prime Minister hopes will win him the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ALP and the union movement spent almost half a million dollars trying to win the seat of Bendigo at the last election. I am pleased to report that they failed miserably. They have now given up that fight, so the Prime Minister does not care about the impact his job compact might have on Bendigo's local economy and he is moving in the direction of privatisation of that facility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper is all about tampering with and reducing the unemployment figures in time for an election in late 1995. The starting date for most of the schemes announced in the white paper is 1 July 1995. There are 233,451 long-term unemployed. Mr Deputy Speaker, think about that large number of people&mdash;233,451&mdash;who have been out of work in this country for 18 months or longer. Five months after 1 July 1995, in about October or November, the schemes announced in the white paper will still have a few months left to run. The Prime Minister will rush off to the polls hoping that, by taking these people off the long-term unemployed list and putting them into the job compact for between six and nine months employment, Australians will believe his illusion that the unemployment rate has fallen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an absolute disgrace that people's lives can be toyed with in this manner by any government in Australia. This is an attempt to manipulate the system to the extent that people do not have the opportunity to get a long-term job. There is no encouragement for the public or private sectors to improve the economic situation so that people can get a permanent job in industry and commerce. This government says, `Let us manipulate the system. Let us get people off the unemployment list. Let us do this at a time when it will be favourable for us to go into an election mode.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at the work that was done on the green paper. A task force went throughout Australia, at huge expense to the Victorian taxpayer, and came back with a lot of answers which the government preferred to ignore. One of the green paper's major recommendations to the government was the development of infrastructure in regional areas of Australia. The budget did not allocate additional money to the development of infrastructure. The government has ignored that recommendation; it has walked away from it. After all the work that task force did throughout Australia in trying to identify problems, I should imagine that the chairman of the task force, Mr Kelty, would be greatly upset by the government's inaction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development of permanent infrastructure leads to permanent jobs. In regional areas of Australia in particular there is a need to develop infrastructure which would support industry and commerce and create an atmosphere of economic development which would lead to permanent jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians will probably understand what Mr Keating is doing. I believe they will. The electorate is very astute. The Prime Minister is going to rush off to the polls, hoping Australians will believe his illusion that the rate of unemployment has fallen. Australians have more sense than that, and they will see this conjuring trick for exactly what it is&mdash;an expensive, cynical exercise which shows absolutely no concern at all for the real plight of the unemployed or for the future of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The future of organisations like Australian Defence Industries lies in the opportunity to seek more work from the public and private sectors, both here in Australia and overseas. With more work coming in, Australian Defence Industries could afford to train more apprentices and technicians and create more permanent jobs. Australia is facing a drastic skills shortage in many trades and at a variety of technical levels, because in recent years employers have been unable to afford to train more apprentices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The high cost of government services and the on-costs which are reflected in the cost of employing apprentices and technicians in training are extremely high, and yet this government has moved not one iota to try to alleviate those costs on employers. If the Prime Minister had the interests of Australia and all Australians at heart, he would be reducing industry and commerce overheads, stimulating the private sector and directing more resources into technician and apprentice training to create real jobs, not temporary jobs, especially in the cynical atmosphere at the moment where we are looking at an election, reducing the numbers of long-term unemployed and building up an atmosphere to go to an election in 1995. All he is doing with this program is paving the way for six months to an election in 1995. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance concerns the method of distribution of the $1 billion annual program of financial assistance grants to local government. It is now appropriate, in the context of a growth economy&mdash;4.5 per cent growth in the coming financial year&mdash;to drive greater equity into all funding programs. Too often notions of social justice are dealt with in a theoretical sense without a clear program of reform. An essential starting point is to ensure that funding programs effectively target the needs of disadvantaged areas and regions. This is a timely grievance, as the government is presently reviewing the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1986. The review and its outcome should adopt the following principles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first principle is to support the role played by local government in the provision of quality of life services. The stereotype in Australian local government of roads, rates and rubbish is now as outdated and old fashioned as the Liberal Party. Four of the five quality of life services in this country are provided by local government: libraries, child care, recreation and cultural facilities. Only education is kept as a state government service. Services like this are essential in promoting a better quality of life in disadvantaged areas and regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, inequality depends as much on where people live and their access to basic services as their access to satisfactory incomes. In affluent local government areas, people have better access through personal incomes and the purchase of private services. They can buy personal libraries instead of using public libraries. They can purchase  cultural and recreational services instead of using community facilities, and they can purchase a greater amount of private child care instead of using publicly provided facilities. In less affluent, more disadvantaged local government areas, these public services take on immense importance and give immense opportunity for promoting the quality of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reform that the act should embrace is to drive greater equity into the allocation of financial assistance grants to local government around Australia. The current system relies on equal per capita grants to each state. The State Grants Commission then allocates funds through the horizontal equalisation principle, which means it promotes equalisation of the capacity to provide services by each local government authority, not equalisation of outcomes for the quality of life in each local government area. There is only a loose correlation between socioeconomic need and the scale of grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria, for instance, in 1991-92, the most disadvantaged 25 per cent of councils averaged grants of $47.77 per capita, while the second most advantaged quarter of councils&mdash;that is, those in the 50 to 75 per cent range&mdash;received $56.52 per capita. In Western Australia, the second quarter of councils received substantially lower per capita grants than the more affluent third quarter. In Tasmania, the second quarter received substantially higher grants than the more disadvantaged first quarter. The state local government grants commissions are not applying indices of socioeconomic need in the allocation of their grants. Australia-wide this results in $200 million of financial assistance and road grants to local government being provided to the 22 per cent most affluent and most advantaged local government areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, on needs based criteria, we cannot defend the way in which state grants commissions are currently undertaking their work and gearing up their funding formulae. There are two reasons for this. No state includes in its funding formula a reliable measure of socioeconomic advantage and disadvantage. That in Australia in the 1990s is absolutely indefensible. In 1986 perhaps it could be understood because the ABS and the Australian Taxation Office had not devised indices of socioeconomic advantage. But, as the current discussion paper provides, they are available and should be picked up in an amendment to the legislation and used by the state local government grants commissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second source of inequity is the distortion provided by the requirement for 30 per cent of funds in each state to be distributed on a per capita basis. This, too, is indefensible in Australia in the 1990s when more disadvantaged communities need the funds that currently we allocate to each community, irrespective of its need; that is, the 30-per cent per capita basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third principle that should be followed in reviewing and reforming the legislation is the integration of specific purpose road grants into global grant allocations. At the moment we have a substitution effect whereby, no matter the size of the road grants, the local government authority simply substitutes what it would have spent out of its own resources of revenue, replacing it with the revenue provided by the State Grants Commission and the federal distribution of grants. This was best pointed out by the Self report into local government finance in 1985. Even National Party members opposite could turn to page 351 of the Self report and read its conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . road grants to local government are very close to general purpose assistance, especially since nothing is done to counter substitution effects at the local government level and ensure that the money actually leads to increased spending on roads . . . in the longer run it would be desirable to absorb the Commonwealth grant for local roads into the program of general purpose assistance.</PARA>
<PARA>That is where the report ends its conclusion. Of course, this principle would be totally consistent with local government autonomy. If a local government authority wanted to take all the money that was allocated to it by the Commonwealth and through the state commission and spend it on roads, that should be its choice. Equally, if a local government authority, responding to local need and circumstance, wanted to take all the funds that had been allocated to it and spend them on libraries, recreational facilities or other quality of life services, that should be at its discretion. As a rule, the decisions thrust upon local government from Canberra are poor decisions; decisions that reinforce local government autonomy and local discretion are good decisions. That should be an important part of changes to the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a problem in the way in which state funding formulae currently disadvantage local government authorities in urban areas for the allocation of road grants when they have a substantial rural road network. We have an artificial distinction and funding divide for so-called rural and so-called urban councils which takes no account of the unique needs in western Sydney, for instance, of classified urban councils which have substantial networks of rural roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth principle which should be followed in reforming the legislation is to restore a component of local capital works program, such as that introduced by the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons) during his term as local government minister. That was a very successful program that provided, in particular, disadvantaged local government areas with their best opportunity to provide the community buildings, the recreation services, the cultural services and the libraries that otherwise could not be funded out of their annual budget. To restore that program out of the current allocation of just more than $1 billion in local government grants would be of enormous benefit to disadvantaged areas and regions throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, the government should be taking the Horton report into public library funding off the shelf, where it has sat since 1975. In Australia the upgrade of municipal libraries has not been part of the general upgrade of education institutions in Australia in the 1980s and 1990s. This government has done it for child care, school education, TAFE and universities. Federal responsibilities to fund municipal libraries should be picked up in the review of the legislation. These library grants should be made through capital assistance to avoid the sort of substitution effect that occurs with grants for recurrent purposes, as we see with the current allocation of road grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth principle that should be adopted in reforming the legislation is to drive an efficiency dividend into local government by rewarding those councils that have reformed their management practices&mdash;that is, brought themselves out of the 1950s right into the 1990s through corporate styles of management, greater efficiency and corporatising various functions, as we see at the more advanced councils that have also engaged in innovative enterprise bargaining arrangements. Rewarding efficient councils would be a most worthwhile practice in the review of the local government legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would recommend strongly that the federal grants be distributed in the following proportions: 70 per cent of the funding, that is, a little more than $740 million in 1993-94, for horizontal equalisation distributed by the state grant commissions; 20 per cent of the funding, a little more than $200 million, for capital works funding distributed authority by local government authority, giving a high preference to quality of life services in areas of greatest socioeconomic need; and 10 per cent for efficiency incentives and rewards available to all councils distributed by local government state grant commissions. I look forward to the completion of the review and the incorporation of these provisions in the legislation by way of amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the last two weeks while parliament was not sitting I have been busy travelling to the more remote areas of my electorate. I would like to share with honourable members some of my experiences and the concerns and difficulties faced by people in the bush. In the first week I travelled with the shadow minister for transport, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp), who is at the table, on what is known as the Kidman Way, or rather the unsealed section of it, which is about half the road that exists between Hillston in the south and up through Cobar to Bourke in the north. That stretch of road is about 408 kilometres long and 190 of those kilometres are unsealed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significance of this route is that people can travel directly north from Melbourne right through to Mount Isa and Darwin on a sealed stretch, except for this small area which remains unsealed. It is a flat, straight stretch and construction costs to bitumen this road are quite low&mdash;of the order of $100,000 to $125,000 per kilometre. I believe it is a very important section of road, because it would give an alternative route to road transport as well as to tourists and would tend to open up that particular inland section of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recorded a very good send off at Hillston where we climbed into a 400-horsepower Mack truck, driven by the shadow minister for the full distance. About 100 people were there to see us off in the Carrathool shire. We went north from there, soon leaving the bitumen a few kilometres out of the town and on to some of the roughest road surfaces that any member would ever wish to travel on. We got to Mount Hope for afternoon tea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to talk to some of the people there who had come from far and wide to meet us. One person who sticks in my mind is Bernadette McMillan, who runs the shop and the mail run in conjunction with her husband. She said to me that they have to change their car tyres every 15,000 kilometres; in other words, they change their tyres about three times a year. At $100 a tyre, it would cost them $1,200 each year for car tyres just on one vehicle, whereas normally it would cost about $400. So the state of the road has added about $800 in costs to one small business just from the cost of car tyres, let alone the cost of the wear and tear on the vehicle and on the human beings who have to drive it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From Mount Hope we pushed north to Cobar where we had another amazing reception. We had dinner that night with all the shires present, including the president of the Federal Inland Development Organisation, Peter Laird. Next morning we pushed on to a construction camp halfway between Cobar and Bourke where again people appeared from hundreds of kilometres away to greet us and impress upon us the need to bitumen this road. From there we arrived in Bourke for lunch, and we had dinner with some councillors who were there for a central economic zone meeting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of this trip, I am pleased to say, the shadow minister, having clearly seen the need to bitumen this road, announced that the coalition, upon return to government, would fully fund it and would do so within a reasonably short time frame. I think it was very welcome news to all the towns along the trip. We keep our promises, unlike honourable members on the other side. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They do, indeed. They do it daily. I undertook a second trip only last week. I travelled 1,700 kilometres from Dubbo, up to Brewarrina, across to Bourke, up to Hungerford, back to Wanaaring and then back to Dubbo. At Brewarrina I met with Feli McHughes and Steven Carr, who are involved with the Aboriginal community in that town. I had the pleasure of travelling over the town and surrounding district with them looking at some of the CDEP schemes that they are overseeing. I was particularly pleased to see that value for the taxpayers' dollar is starting to flow through in tree planting, landscaping and other projects that are starting to be put in place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That night I travelled to Bourke. The next day I pushed on to Enngonia, about 100 kilometres north of Bourke. The first place I visited there was the school. I must take my hat off to Margie Haley, the principal, who has 23 children in the school&mdash;50 per cent of them are Aboriginal&mdash;as well as the preschool classes that are run there. There is no rubbish in the school, no graffiti and very low absenteeism; the school itself is a credit to her and should be a model for other schools throughout New South Wales. The school was concerned, though, that because the town is so small there is no 60 kilometre zone outside the school. So when the children cross the main road they are sometimes subject to road transport going through at high speed. I will be following this up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About 100 to 150 Aborigines live just outside the town in the mission. Since the clinic sister has been taken out of the town, the ambulance service from Bourke, 100 kilometres away, has increased its trips from about one every two months to about one every day. With about $400 per trip being passed on to the taxpayer, there is a very good case for a couple of clinic sisters to be put back in Enngonia to service the local population. Perhaps those in ATSIC and the federal Department of Human Services and Health should get their heads together and get a couple of Aboriginal clinic sisters, in particular, to live in Enngonia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next we crossed the very rough and bulldust-strewn road to Fords Bridge. We had lunch there that day in Max and Jean Bambrick's pub. A lot of local citizens came to meet with me. Naturally they discussed the shocking state of the road, particularly north from Bourke heading into Fords Bridge, and the desirability even to get down five kilometre strips of black top so that at least when they are travelling that road they have a chance to pass the road trains. When people are travelling behind a road train they have to drop back two or three kilometres. We mentioned many problems. Woody weeds was one of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reg and Dot Hatch are experts on woody weeds because they have done a lot of blade ploughing and sowing of buffel grass, et cetera, on their property to get rid of this. Woody weeds is now the biggest problem in the western division of New South Wales. Various methods have been tried, apart from blade ploughing, such as burning, chemical control, biological control and such things. A lot of research has to be done into this. Perhaps tax relief should be given in some areas because it is cutting the stocking rate on some properties by 20 per cent&mdash;up to 80 per cent in some cases. Some paddocks that could be mustered in half a day now take more than a week. It also looks very bad aesthetically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pushing north from there to Yantabulla, the citizens there raised a number of problems with me. I will mention just two or three quickly. Citizens have to pay $3,000 for a 1 1/2 metre dish with a black box. By law they are only allowed to watch the ABC plus one commercial channel. People who live in Bourke not only do not have to buy a dish but can watch the ABC plus two commercial channels. For the life of me, I cannot see why these people are not allowed to watch the second commercial channel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of telephones was raised. In this part of the world there are no untimed telephone calls. Whereas we can talk for an unlimited amount of time for 25c, people out there get charged 25c every 4 1/2 minutes. People who live out there, particularly the women, like to ring up their neighbour from time to time and have a chat for half an hour or so to regain their sanity, to find out what is going on and these types of things, but it is hard to do that when the meter is ticking away and they are being charged 25c every 4 1/2 minutes. They also raised concerns relating to the ICPA correspondence allowance, which all primary children in that area partake of. It has been stuck on $500 per year for quite some time now and I think there is a very good case for having that lifted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From there I pushed north to Hungerford and stayed overnight, and then next day went down to Wanaaring. The people there raised numerous issues, including the road and the contact children's mobile, which services 130 children in an area the size of Tasmania. We talked about fuel taxes and the need for lights on the airport so that the royal flying doctor could land at night. From there I went back to Bourke and serviced other towns such as Byrock, Coolibah and Girilambone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many issues come up in trips like this. I take great pleasure today in bringing before members of the House some of the issues which concern people who live in remote areas. I hope the government will be able to act on some of them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with interest to the speech of the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb). I invite you to come down to the state of Victoria to see what happens when Fightback is implemented by a conservative government. You can have a look at the massive cuts in infrastructure. Obviously you support the closure of at least 20 rural hospitals. You stand here as a rural representative and say that you support it. I will go back to Victoria quite happily and say that the National Party in Australia supports the Victorian National Party in closing rural hospitals. I am pleased to be able to say that because that is what would happen with Fightback&mdash;$10 billion in cuts. You never read the document, obviously. The Victorian government is destroying the infrastructure of Victoria, destroying rural Victoria, closing rural schools, closing rural hospitals and taking funding off rural councils for roads. This is obviously what the National Party supports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw attention to another problem in Victoria, which is a direct result of Liberal-National Party policy: the attack on the judicial system and on the very foundation of justice in this country. The massive cuts to the judicial system in Victoria are causing grave concerns across the board and are producing results adverse to justice. My particular concern today is with the judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of Victoria in the matter of the Queen v. Wilson and Grimwade. It involves a case known as the Jet Corp case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of Victoria came to a very perverse finding indeed&mdash;a finding which throws into doubt whether or not white-collar criminals can properly be dealt with by the judicial system of our country. It throws into doubt whether the Melbourne Club has more power than even I suspected and it throws justice into doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three of the five people charged have been convicted and punished and two were let loose by the Supreme Court. The essential background facts are in the judgment and it is worth while reciting from the judgment what those background facts are. They are vastly simplified, of course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It involves a company called Jet Corporation Australia Pty Ltd. In September 1981 Huttley, a chartered accountant versed in tax minimisation schemes, Collier and the applicant Wilson became its directors. The Jet Corporation Australia Trust was, according to its trustee, established on 20 December 1981 and consisted of 100 units of $150,000 each. The trustee was JCA, or Jet Corporation Australia Pty Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time a long established business known as Schutt Aviation was engaged in the acquisition, operation and sale of commercial aircraft, carried on in Moorabbin in Victoria. Wilson was involved with that, together with one called Sent and one called Forshaw. The purposes of the JCA Trust were to acquire the aircraft business for $12 million and then conduct it. Those who stood to benefit from the JCA's acquisition and conduct of the aircraft business were Huttley, Collier, Dyer, Wilson and Sir Andrew Grimwade. The last is a well-known businessman, member of the Melbourne Club, prominent member of the Liberal Party and known to many. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple facts of this case are not in dispute. A prospectus was put out which was dishonest. Among other things, that prospectus said that Grimwade would be taking a subscription in the trust. That was not true. Grimwade was paid $900,000-odd for lending his name to a false prospectus. None of these facts are in dispute. It was a major white-collar crime one would think worthy of punishment. Yet, when we find out what happened, we really have to scratch our heads and ask seriously whether or not white-collar criminals are dealt with properly in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The investigation was conducted by the National Crime Authority&mdash;it put together a brief for prosecution and the prosecution was conducted by the DPP of Victoria&mdash;and at the committal proceedings Collier, Huttley and Dyer pleaded guilty. Huttley gave evidence for the Crown against Wilson and Grimwade. The jury, after a long and complicated trial, found Grimwade and Wilson guilty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept that there were major problems in the trial. The bar of Victoria should really think seriously about the performance of the barristers in that trial. The Supreme Court, in my view quite fairly, criticised the barristers concerned because they, quite frankly, made a mess of it. They prolonged the trial to the extent that that was the ground for the appeal. So here is a system of justice in which three people pleading guilty have been convicted, one giving evidence against two co-offenders, and the trial is run in such a way as to make it complicated, to prolong the trial to nearly 21 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One must also raise the issue that the judge was involved in other matters and could not sit consistently on the trial. What sort of justice system have we got when the judge who is supposed to run the conduct of the trial is not even available for most of the trial period because he is on another matter? That is a grave concern in the way justice is run. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The barrister, appointed I understand for Wilson by Legal Aid, was severely criticised by the appellate court. According to the judgment, he behaved in a way which was unnecessary and caused grave concern about the conduct of the trial. That is all very well. I am not here to support barristers. I want to know why white-collar criminals cannot get convicted. Nevertheless, the judges raised that as a serious concern. In the course of the judgment the judges raised this very interesting question. They said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question we are to consider is whether, in the circumstances we have described, there was a real danger that, as regards the applicant Grimwade, the jury failed to perform their function properly. That was a test propounded in R. v. Higgins . . . and accepted by all counsel here. In whose perception is such real danger to be seen?</PARA>
<PARA>That is the question. In whose perception is the real danger to be seen? Through whose eyes was justice to be seen to be done? Is it through the barristers, through appellate judges of the Supreme Court or through the investors of Jet Corp, who blew all their money because of a criminal fraud? That is the question. In whose eyes is justice seen to be done? The judges asked that. They say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The answer to each question must be that the verdict is to be recognizably true and fair to an objective observer having knowledge of all the relevant facts and circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is interesting that Mr Chief Justice Phillips in the course of his judgment pointed out that his and the court's judgment was not to be seen as a finding of innocence of Mr Grimwade. That is a strange statement for an appellate court to make. I would have thought those who are practised in the law and who have heard many judgments would consider that that is a strange thing for a judge to say. He is really saying, `Despite the fact we are going to overturn a decision, we do in the process of overturning the decision nevertheless make the point that we do not find him innocent.' If he is not innocent, why is he not found guilty? If he is guilty, why has the system not properly found him guilty as the jury found him guilty and found Wilson guilty? It is unbelievable that a 21-month trial before a jury finds a verdict which can then be overturned by an appellate court under these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I firmly believe that many of those problems in Victoria are because of massive funding cuts to judges and the court system. I think some people at the bar need a good examination. We all know&mdash;we are seeing it in other court cases around Australia&mdash;that if one has the money, if one comes from privilege and one has wealth, one can use our judicial system to extend and delay to the extent that appellate courts will find that there is a problem with the trial because of length and delay. Then that person is off the hook. If that is what this House accepts as justice in white-collar crime areas and if that is what the state of Victoria accepts as justice in white-collar crime areas, then, frankly, I do not like it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me remind the House that these are not just my views. I have a great deal of respect for the President of the Liberal Party of Australia, Mr Staley, who was involved in raising these allegations&mdash;in fact, he was very prominent in ensuring that Grimwade was brought to trial. There must be a lot of people out there who feel quite sick in the stomach as a result of this decision by the appellate division of the Supreme Court. It is time we had a good look at justice and at the way white-collar criminals seem to manipulate the system because of wealth and privilege. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As members in this place will be very much aware, I have been very concerned at the movement of aircraft, particularly jet aircraft, over Botany Bay and its environs since I was first elected here in 1966. So it will come as no great surprise to realise that I am grieving very seriously in today's grievance debate about planes overflying the Sutherland shire. This movement is ostensibly because of the construction of the third runway at the Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport which, thanks to the skilful administration of the Federal Airports Corporation in Sydney, has been running ahead of its projected completion dates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was informed by the FAC in Sydney last week that the completion of the physical construction of the third runway is expected to be 1 October 1994, which is eight months ahead of the original date of 1 June 1995. Even though the construction will be completed by 1 October this year, there remains much still to be done. For those of us who travel under the third runway on a regular basis, it is obvious that the new control tower is a good way off. I am informed that the third runway will not be fully operational until the middle of 1995, which is still nine months ahead of the FAC's original schedule. This is all well and good, and I congratulate Mr Bill Swingler and all his people at the FAC&mdash;contractors, managers, workers&mdash;for having achieved this great construction advantage by finishing everything nine months ahead of schedule, which is quite an achievement with public activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However it has not all been plain sailing, as members of my electorate can attest. I have asked many people to keep a timetable of planes flying over their homes. Through those timetables and through letters I have received, from Mrs Johnson of Yowie Bay and many others, you can understand that it has been a confounded pest and a nuisance to residents in my electorate&mdash;including, of course, me. The range of complaints has come from mothers of small babies, husbands of wives who suffer migraine headaches, elderly people who feel nervous, and other people who are just plain irritated by the problems that have arisen while the third runway has been under construction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let there be no doubt, the people of my electorate are mad that they have had so many overflights during this period. I have been making inquiries of Sydney airport for all of this period, and in a most pleasant and, I trust, most truthful way I have been informed that there will be no air traffic over the Sutherland shire once the third runway is operational. So it is a mixed bag for me: great pleasure that the third runway will be fully operational in mid-1995, not 1996 as originally planned; and further great pleasure from the confirmed advice from airport authorities that there will be basically no air traffic over the Sutherland shire from that time on. On the other hand, these same airport authorities know how angry I have been on behalf of my constituents that the site, as well as the noise of planes, is going to be the cause of great irritation and disturbance to my constituents until mid-1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very short distance south of my electorate is the sadly burnt out but thankfully regrowing Royal National Park. These same planes should have been flying over this national park; not over my electorate. Thank goodness I have not had the experience of the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) of seeing an air accident within my electorate, albeit a long time ago. I pray that this will never happen in and around Sydney ever again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank all of those constituents who wrote me strong but courteous letters complaining of the overflight of jet aircraft.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am happy to say that since 1966 I have in my electorate been relentlessly concerned about the development of the major airport across the other side of Botany Bay. Come on air traffic controllers, fly some of those aircraft over the recovering national park instead of over one of the loveliest parts of Australia, the Cook electorate, as you now do. This very day I had occasion to fly to and back from Sydney. We flew in a 737 over the national park, not over the Sutherland shire. This clearly shows to me that it can be done. So, air traffic controllers, how about changing the flights as of now, not waiting for another year?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we are talking in a grievance debate, I thought I should mention that a number of my electors have again complained to me in recent times of the ground tremors that have been brought about by the service activities at the big military camps in the Hughes electorate to the south of Cook. I dare say the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Tickner) has been receiving even more complaints than I have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is one of the strange geophysical problems of Sydney that ground tremors at Holdsworthy and other military areas have a problem of being transported and felt, particularly at Grays Point and South Cronulla, within my electorate. These irritations are not regular, but they are disturbing to the people so many miles away from the event that is causing them. These were particularly bad when the Claymore mines were being tested during the Vietnam war. Though I have been aware of the army's cognisance of the effects of the artillery and mines on the environs at their camps, I maintain this again today to remind the army officials that it does still happen and that care should be taken by them when they participate in such practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Flying over the burnt out national park today reminded me of the move by the wildlife foundation people to do away with the large herd of Asian deer which has been in the Royal National Park for a very long time. For you, Mr Deputy Speaker Rocher, not coming from Sydney, I point out that the Royal National Park in Sydney is the second oldest national park in the world. It was beaten by the famous one in the United States. It was one of the great tragedies of the bushfires that took place in Sydney a few months ago that this huge national park was 99 per cent destroyed, with rainforests totally eliminated. People are now saying they are pleased to see some regrowth. </PARA>

It is a nonsense for some of these environmental officials to think they should be done away with. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in the grievance debate to mention the future of the port of Geelong in my electorate. When Labor was elected to power in 1983, it embarked on a broad program of micro-economic reform like no other government had attempted before in the previous two decades. The government viewed the process of micro-economic reform as essential if the Australian economy was to successfully restructure and maintain its international competitiveness in the long term.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important part of that micro-economic reform agenda, which effectively commenced in 1984, has been the reform of the Australian waterfront. Plagued by gross economic inefficiencies that had developed over decades and by low productivity and high levels of industrial disputation, there was an urgent need to undertake meaningful reform and remove the impediments that were blocking an improvement to our export performance. The tortuous and essential waterfront reform program began in 1984. It had three main elements: firstly, to overhaul stevedoring employment arrangements; secondly, to implement port authority reforms; and, thirdly, to encourage greater competition in the industry and to ensure the benefits of reform were passed on to the users. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all of these areas of reform, the government has been spectacularly successful. Those achievements include enterprise employment, which has brought waterfront employment in line with other Australian industries by making employers directly responsible for the recruitment of labour, enterprise training, wages and dispute settlement. Secondly, we have seen industrial award restructuring, which has resulted in a far more flexible and adaptable stevedoring work force. Thirdly, we have seen a rejuvenation of the waterfront work force, and we now have a far more flexible and adaptable work force in that area. Also, a more competitive structure has been created at the port level with the removal of industry employment arrangements which allow different ports the ability to pursue different and more appropriate strategies to improve efficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scorecard is fairly impressive. Cargo handling rates have risen by some 57 per cent. Ship turnaround times at container terminals have reduced by some 45 per cent. Improvements at bulk cargo handling ports have helped make Australian grain ports&mdash;I include the port of Geelong in this&mdash;among the most efficient in the world, with loading times on grain vessels reduced from 4.5 days in 1988 to 1.9 days in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that the port of Geelong in my electorate of Corio has embraced the reform process with an impressive sense of professionalism and considerable enthusiasm. The port of Geelong is the city of Geelong's gateway to the world. It is our gateway to the international commercial marketplace. The port is a critical facility that links existing road and rail infrastructure and a productive hinterland to that international marketplace. Therefore, it was absolutely critical that the quest for greater operating efficiencies be pursued professionally and with a minimum of disruption at that particular facility. This has been done and the results are quite outstanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the achievements of the port are concerned, over the past three years there has been a reduction of over 50 per cent in the permanent work force. But, more importantly, these labour reductions have been achieved in a spirit of cooperation between management and labour and without industrial disputation. Manning levels currently are around 150 and are programmed to reduce to 100 by the end of the year. Also there has been a multiskilling of the remaining work force and an improvement in ship turnaround time at the port. There has been a reduction in operating expenses and a lift in net profit. All these gains have been accompanied by increased benefits to the users of this port facility. The port has pursued a policy of divesting itself of non-core assets and unproductive assets and has, in recent times, embarked on a significant program of public investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two major recent investments are the modernisation of the bulk handling facilities and the deepening of approach channels to the port. The modernisation of bulk handling facilities at Lascelles wharf has cost $21 million. The program will improve productivity by 60-plus per cent and attract more industry into the Oyster Cove industrial land development area. The deepening of approach channels by one metre for 27 kilometres from the port has been a $35 million investment driven by the grain and oil industries. That will be completed in 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as its current economic and commercial performance are concerned, we have seen net profit increase to $8.5 million. Total revenue has increased by 15 per cent to $20 million in 1992-93. Cargo volumes have increased by 1.7 million tonnes&mdash;one million tonnes due to increased tonnages of petroleum products and 700,000 due to increased tonnages of grain. In that time, the authority's expenses fell by 23 per cent to achieve that improved profit performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is against this background that one must view with some concern recent press reports in Geelong suggesting that the Kennett government in Victoria has plans afoot to disaggregate the port's assets and to sell them off to the private sector. There are several significant disadvantages in this disaggregation suggestion. At a time when the port has achieved these record profit levels, the state government will cut itself off from a significant income stream and any  potential growth in that income stream in the future. There is also a potential for us to see a return to industrial confrontation. The needs of people who are currently working at the port really need to be taken into account. I am yet to be convinced that a disaggregation policy will improve services to the port's customers. The port has certainly improved its marketing performance and this has been reflected in higher turnover figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to comment in the time I have remaining on the value of the port of Geelong to the Geelong community. It is something that ought to be injected into the decision equation when the Victorian government sits down and decides what policy it will pursue with regard to the port. Certainly, the port is a critical piece of economic infrastructure to the city and to the region. However, the authority, which has guided its development and its evolution, has played a far wider role in the economic forums of the city and in the life of the city. The Port of Geelong Authority has accumulated specialist skills and knowledge, which have been put to the advantage of the city of Geelong. It has achieved cooperation between management and labour which I think is a model for enterprises in the Geelong region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, it has been a catalyst for bringing together the private business community and the government sector. Those of us in Geelong who have been to the port of Geelong dinners, where issues of economic substance have been discussed and representatives of the private sector community and the government sector have come together around the dinner table to chew over these issues, can see the value of the port of Geelong in that networking process within a local  community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the Port of Geelong Authority has been a catalyst for undertaking significant lobbying efforts on behalf of the Geelong community. I refer to the lobbying which took place to have the standard gauge route from Adelaide to Melbourne relocated from Ballarat through Geelong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The port of Geelong was one of the coordinating mechanisms that brought the Geelong Regional Commission, the port of Geelong, political players, local employers, local unions and local government together to pursue that lobbying task and to have the standard gauge rerouted through Geelong. It was a particularly successful undertaking. It was typical of the role that has been played over time by the Port of Geelong Authority in the economic life of Geelong. It would be disappointing to see the Kennett government implement a policy of disaggregating the port assets and selling them off. It would lead to the dismembering of the Port of Geelong Authority and the significant loss of this facility to Geelong. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I also table the minutes and evidence of the inquiry. On 4 May the committee was asked to consider the bill and prepare an advisory report. Since then we have received 40 submissions, forming over 300 pages of written evidence. We have also taken 350 pages of evidence at public hearings. It has been a tight schedule.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that the parliament should pass a good bill, not just any bill. This bill should not be passed without some essential amendments. The committee agrees with the objectives of the bill and the efforts to stamp out the conduct targeted by the bill. But we have to be careful. If we act in haste to address the problem of child sex tourism, there will be unintended consequences, including fundamental changes to our standards of justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want a model bill&mdash;one we can be proud of and one which answers the concerns raised during the second reading debate and during our consideration of the bill. We must get the legislation right. The report we are tabling today includes 37 recommendations which are aimed at creating better legislation&mdash;better able to achieve its objectives and at the same time better able to maintain the standards of justice which are the basis of Australian law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians travelling overseas have been able to abuse children sexually and escape the consequences of their behaviour once they have returned to Australia. The same conduct would be criminal if it were perpetrated in Australia. This conduct is repugnant to Australians and to the world, not least because of the devastating effect on children in the countries concerned. A secondary effect of this conduct is that it brings Australians into disrepute. Such conduct should be regarded as criminal, despite the fact that it occurs in other countries. Related conduct perpetrated in Australia&mdash;encouraging and benefiting&mdash;should also be proscribed in the Commonwealth Crimes Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the beginning of our consideration of the bill, concerns were expressed about provisions in the bill which, in the view of many eminent legal practitioners who gave evidence, contain unacceptable changes to criminal law principles and procedures. These include apparent short cuts to assist the prosecution because of the practical difficulties of conducting a successful prosecution. Examples are the reversal of the onus of proof in clause 50CC and the arrangements for estimating the age of the child in clause 50FA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that certain clauses can be successfully redrafted to ensure the bill is effective and enforceable without abandoning the safeguards that have been traditional elements of the criminal law in Australia. In reconsidering the bill, the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) and his department should consult widely with practitioners in order to discover solutions to some of the practical and legal problems identified by the committee. The committee has been informed by the New South Wales Bar Association and by individual barristers, Mr James QC and Mr Sides QC, that they would be happy to assist the minister with the bill. These offers were made to assist the legislation to pass through both houses on a bipartisan basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of child sex tourism is an emotive one, arousing universal feelings of revulsion and hostility. One might suppose that the bipartisan support for the bill's objectives would make the preparation of an advisory report a relatively simple task. However, the emotional and psychological context in which the bill has been studied has threatened to detract from a rational, balanced and considered approach to the draft legislation itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Committee members have been lobbied by those who fear that the committee has wanted to water down the legislation. These fears are misplaced and misguided. The committee has been concerned to ensure that a bill which has almost universal political support for its fundamental objective is workable and effective. At the same time, it must maintain the presumption of innocence and ensure that persons charged receive a fair trial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the parliament accepts the recommendations made by the committee in this report, the bill will be a much clearer and more effective piece of legislation. It will provide a stronger deterrent than the current draft, and it will be enforceable. The protection offered to children in countries outside Australia will be greater. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several witnesses urged the committee to put the finetuning of the bill above any considerations of urgency to pass it. The committee was urged to recommend consideration of the bill by the Law Reform Commission. The arguments for passing the legislation as soon as possible go to social policy considerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community, the government and members of parliament, including committee members, are anxious to have the legislation in place as quickly as possible in order to address the crimes encompassed by the legislation. Nevertheless, the committee urges the parliament to take account of the legitimate issues and concerns raised by witnesses during the consideration of the bill. Addressing these concerns will not result in undue delay; rather, delay&mdash;which should be no more than two months&mdash;will be time well spent to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I wish to join with the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), and thank my colleagues on this committee. It has been an intense examination, and it has been an emotive and difficult topic, given the time that we were allowed and some of the complexities of the legal issues that were raised. The staff members of the committee have been excellent in their support and have worked extreme hours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the first reference of legislation to a House of Representatives committee. It has been an interesting learning curve for us. In future we will have discussions with the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) as to the time frame and the prospect of quick responses to complex legislation. We would prefer to see fewer time constraints than we have had in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues raised in this report and those identified by the committee as not being given full attention by the government have been quite diverse. Firstly, the committee realised how difficult it would be to gain sound evidence under the terms of pursuing somebody for a crime committed outside of Australia. The former Attorney-General, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), is in the chamber. I know that he would acknowledge some of the difficulties experienced, first of all, with the war crimes legislation and the concept of pursuing somebody for prosecution, albeit 40 years after the event, with evidence from overseas&mdash;bringing witnesses to Australia and cross-examining them here&mdash;or with people not understanding Australian law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a greater complexity in this legislation. With respect to the possibility of video linked evidence, there may be interference with witnesses as they provide evidence in a studio or in a venue where only part of the environment can be seen. The prospect of intimidation, bribery and corruption in that process is a matter that concerns the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role of state governments is also of concern to the committee. Much of the licensing process and the process by which paedophiles seeking to visit countries away from Australia's shores on sex tours gather together rests with state governments. State governments must have complementary legislation in place in order for this legislation to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee proposes that maximum offences be in place for crimes committed against children under the age of 16. We believe that, in sentencing, the courts should take note of the age of children, but that there should be no exception with respect to age, as the government originally proposed in its legislation. I have a slightly different view from that of my colleagues which is not expressed in the dissenting report. I find that, on balance, the proposition contained in recommendation 18 may allow otherwise sound prosecutions to fail. The obnoxious character of this trade leads me to conclude that defence based on belief of age must be proved on the balance of probabilities. I am seeking to reverse the onus of proof on the probability of age. I think the defence needs to demonstrate beyond doubt that the person involved in this obnoxious process did have grounds to believe that the person was over the age of 16. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My learned colleagues failed to convince me that there needs to be consistency between laws which apply to individuals committing an offence within Australia and those which apply to individuals committing the same offence in a foreign country. It is my belief that poverty will lead people to do practically anything to survive. Australian citizens and residents should not play any part in the abuse and the sexual exploitation of children under the age of 16 anywhere in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the committee decided that defence should be based on the belief of age. As I have said, we have considered that matter and my view varies slightly from that of my colleagues. We do not believe that consent should form part of the defence. So we have taken a stronger view than the government in that regard. We considered the issue of corroborating evidence and we do not believe that corroborating evidence is necessary. This legislation should be passed as quickly as possible. In light of our submissions and our careful work, the government should consider the legislation and return it to the House as a matter of urgency. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;As was indicated by the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), and the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), this was a very difficult reference for the committee. As the honourable member for Banks pointed out and as is contained in the foreword of our report, that arose because this issue is an emotive one. It also arouses very strong feelings of revulsion and hostility. In that context we, as members of the House of Representatives committee, had to examine in detail the provisions of the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill, as we were asked to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a first for this committee. Most of these matters are referred to a committee of the other place. On this occasion it was referred to a committee of the House of Representatives. Very briefly, I would like to endorse the comments made by both the previous speakers, the honourable member for Banks and the honourable member for Mitchell, in thanking the secretariat. The honourable member for Banks said that the secretariat went way beyond the call of duty and there is no question that that is correct. I also thank the members of the committee who, on a very difficult matter, worked very well together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are 37 recommendations made by the committee. As is noted by the chairman in the foreword of the report, if the parliament accepts the recommendations made by the committee in this report, the bill will be a much clearer and more effective piece of legislation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 50FC of the bill provided that a judge may direct a new trial for an alternative offence. A day after we started these proceedings, a joint news release was put out by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr). It said that the government had proposed workable and effective legislation to dramatically improve the chance of securing convictions of Australians who engage in this sordid trade in young children. Whilst every single person in this place agrees with the sentiments behind that, we could not agree that this legislation which we were asked to look at was either workable or effective. In fact, it was anything but that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One example of that was clause 50FC, which is referred to in that press release as part of workable and effective legislation. It was an attempt to reflect the common law position that a jury cannot convict an accused of an offence of an entirely different character from that alleged in the indictment, as set out in paragraph 6.4.1 of our report. This section attracted universal criticism. It attracted criticism from people such as Mr James QC and Mr Sides QC. Mr James's views are set out in paragraph 6.4.2. Even stronger was the criticism from Mr Sides QC. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is an attempt to try and codify a procedural matter, and I fear that in that attempt there will be miscarriages of justice. The procedures are already there to ensure that justice occurs, and I do not think there ought to be an attempt to qualify, or codify them, or put them in a straitjacket. I do not think that proposed section 50FC, in any shape or form, is necessary.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee therefore recommends that clause 50FC be deleted. The reason I touch on that is that, if this committee is to work effectively, the ministers concerned&mdash;in this instance, the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice&mdash;ought to show a little more maturity than to issue a press release on 19 May, after we had our first hearing on 18 May, pouring a bucket on the committee. They said that they rejected assertions that had been made in the standing committee the day before. They asserted that the presumption of innocence and a fair trial are established principles of Australian justice and that those rights would not be compromised by this legislation. We did not agree with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill needed to be tidied up in more ways than one. It was an exercise which was extremely interesting. As the honourable member for Mitchell mentioned, it was the first time a matter such as this had been referred to a committee of the House of Representatives. We certainly hope that it is not the last time, although I mention another point raised by the honourable member for Mitchell&mdash;that we would not want the same time constraint placed upon the committee as was the case with this bill. If we had a little more time, it would have made it a lot easier on everyone, particularly the secretariat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill, after we have been through it and have made 37 recommendations, is now workable and effective. Before the examination of this bill by the committee, it was not workable and effective. I only hope that the government takes on board the recommendations of the committee to bring about legislation to stop and properly put to one side forever this revolting practice which is taking place and in which Australians are involved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I am delighted to be able to speak on this report, for more than one reason. Firstly, the bill has come forward with bipartisan support, but as a result of the committee's deliberations I believe it will be in a much improved form. The second point, which was touched on by, particularly, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), is that this is the first occasion on which a House of Representatives standing committee has had a bill referred to it for review and an advisory report. In my former capacity as the shadow Attorney-General I was delighted to have been, in effect, responsible for that having happened. The cooperative manner in which all members of the committee worked together, the resulting report and, if the recommendations are accepted, the resulting legislation will stand as a monument to the participation of committee members in the legislative process. For once, the House of Representatives will be seen to be participating in the proper drafting of legislation, something that in my experience in this House does not happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation was adventurous and innovative but unfortunately its format when presented did not strike an appropriate balance between the conviction of those guilty of the repugnant practices to which the bill is addressed and the interests of justice and protection of those who are unfairly or wrongly accused&mdash;the protection of the innocent. There was virtual unanimity of view among witnesses that the proper protections of persons accused of the offences to be constituted in the bill were not there. There was unanimity of view, except on one very small point, among committee members as to how those defects could be overcome. I commend the bill to the ministers for their very close consideration in the light of the committee report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Holt mentioned the press release issued by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) and the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley). I endorse entirely what the honourable member for Holt said about the inappropriateness of the intervention of the ministers in that way. It was entirely wrong and based on wrong factual assumptions. I also support the comments of the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), the chairman of the committee, as to the role of the secretariat staff, whom he named. They worked under considerable pressure to produce what, in the circumstances, is a report of a reasonably high standard. I wish to be associated with the compliments paid to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is important. It deals with some important issues, including the definition of the very offences that the bill is concerned with, the onus of proof, the taking of evidence from overseas witnesses by video link and the proof of age in the absence of formal records. Each of those issues goes very much to the heart of the administration of justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that this will be a model for future consideration of legislation that would benefit in its formulation from detailed review and criticism and detailed participation by interested community groups.

There was no witness who gave evidence who in any way sought to detract from the objectives of the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;At the outset I would like to add my thanks to the members of the secretariat for their assistance in this very rushed process. The report we now have on our desks in parliament is literally hot off the press. That indicates a number of things which we do not need to go into other than has been expressed so far. I joined this committee only recently. Not having had any legal background, unlike most of my colleagues on the committee, I perhaps approached this matter from a different perspective and without the expertise or experience to comment on the more detailed technical aspects of the legalities of justice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that we sometimes take for granted which we should not is our system of justice and also, to a certain extent, the standards in our society that have led us to appreciate the way in which people should be treated if they are accused of any particular crime or action in our society. We have developed a system of justice over many centuries and, by and large, it works quite well. In other regards, we have standards in our society which are relatively new. While some may seek to criticise the systems in other countries where life can be considerably cheaper, it was only a short while ago that child labour and slave labour existed in our country. So we need to put that into perspective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concerns arise because during the conduct of this inquiry I got a lot of letters, as did other members. Very few dealt with the legalities that the committee was considering in attempting to get this bill right, and most agreed with the committee that something had to be done and done quickly. I am concerned that many people were dealing with the issue in a less than legal framework, and were either misinformed or underinformed. I hope this report puts their minds at rest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mention has been made that this is a model bill; in fact, it should be a model bill. We are embarking upon an extraterritorial form of legislation which is important in our region. As I understand it, we are the only country in our region to have legislation like this&mdash;some European countries have this sort of legislation&mdash;and as we are part of this region it is important to have this legislation. It should not simply be a matter of model legislation. I think it also goes to a model of action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the attention of the House to paragraph 2.16 in the report regarding the protection of witnesses. I think the intent of this legislation is something that very few people in Australia and, indeed, other countries would find any argument with. My concern is that we make sure that this law does what it sets out to do&mdash;that is, protect the children that we are seeking to protect from the actions of those Australians who do not have that attitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is that, should a case be brought before an Australian court, the Australian government and the prosecution have the responsibility of ensuring that a person, particularly a young child, is given the full and total protection using every resource possible and available to the Australian government. The last thing anyone would want to see is a prosecution against any person leading to any threat to a witness. We are all aware that in some countries big issues and lots of money are involved for the people involved in this trade, whether they be military, police or others. I fear very much that any child used as a witness in a case like this would be at serious risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is very much a responsibility incumbent upon the ministers, who quite correctly bring this forward, to make sure that&mdash;and I would seek this commitment from the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) and anyone else concerned&mdash;every resource be brought to bear to protect any witness who was brought forward in this circumstance. It is relatively difficult even within the Australian context, where we have some control, to ensure the protection of witnesses, but a  child in such a high risk situation, as he or she would obviously be in this event, would be even further at risk. I would not want it on my head, and I do not think anyone else would, that a law, if it were not backed up by action on the ground, to protect a child witness or anyone else could be responsible for even greater physical harm than occurs to that witness at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings into play issues around the way Australia should be directing its aid resources and, both in a general framework, as highlighted in paragraph 2.16, and more specifically, how it should be directing those resources to protect any child involved in any case before this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I wanted to speak for several reasons. First, for the last parliament and this parliament I have been a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, yet in this particular inquiry I have played no part. I have been overseas and therefore was unable to participate either in the taking of evidence or in the subsequent considerations. For that reason I am able to step back a little and at arm's length say to the chairman, deputy chairman and members of the committee that I think they have reason to be proud of the work that they have done. To the staff, in particular, I would like to extend my compliments because I think it was not easy to complete the report in the form they have in the time available. The report is a tribute to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second and perhaps more fundamental reason is that, as one who long ago had reservations about the way this House could best consider legislation, and who was in part responsible for there no longer being legislation committees of this House, I think this report shows to the government an excellent way difficult and complex pieces of legislation can be examined, dispassionately and on a bipartisan basis on matters of principle, reasonable accord reached and far better legislation evolved. The one qualification I have is that I regret that my good friend the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) is not in the House tonight to listen to this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ministers need to understand that for all that they hold for the time being a high and mighty responsibility, they are after all initially members of this place and would do well to listen to debates such as this and to participate in consideration of legislation for which ultimately they are responsible. In that respect I am pleased to note that there is some reference to the need for complementary legislation. There is also reference&mdash;I think it is recommendation 36&mdash;to the need for the ministers to consult with members of the New South Wales Bar Association and with senior counsel who have offered advice and tendered evidence to the committee and whose advice I believe would be helpful in the redraft of the legislation which this report recommends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the detail of the report, there are three issues I want to raise. The first is that as one who has been involved, through my wife Rosemary Sinclair, with the prevention of child abuse in Australia I am very much in favour of the purport of this legislation, but I am also in favour of the videotaping of evidence of children. Chief magistrate Ron Cahill of the ACT initiated this form of taking evidence. For all that I recognise the difficulties involved, I believe it essential that in the nature and character of evidence being taken from abroad videotaping of the evidence of children be permitted in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue is that, nonetheless, I think we need to be aware of the onus of proof and of the absolute need for any type of legislation not to deprive an accused person of the rights of the presumption of innocence. I believe it is necessary to get a proper balance between those two. It is essential that there be capacity to take video evidence in this field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third issue I wanted to touch on is my concern that in the nature of the report a number of errors have been apparent. One is the question of trying to determine the age of a child. It is absolutely essential that we do not leave the successful prosecution of an offence that takes place outside Australia to the determination of whether or not a child is under 10. That is an extraordinarily difficult decision to take. I note the reservations entered by my colleague the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) with respect to the whole question of the presumptions and the beliefs that an individual has, but at the same time&mdash;his reservations will have to be proved on the balance of probabilities&mdash;my concern is that it is important that there be a change in that age restraint. I am pleased to see that that has been recommended by the committee. I strongly recommend that to the government because I think it is a sensible and necessary amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of matters which relate to the extent to which there is a constitutional capacity of the Australian parliament to address this type of legislation. I am quite convinced that it can be undertaken under the external affairs power. For that reason I have no doubt regarding the validity of the legislation. For all I noticed that there was some evidence contrary to that, I believe that there is a constitutional power. I commend the report, I commend the committee and I trust that the government will introduce the amended legislation as expeditiously as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;In speaking in support of the advisory report of the Joint Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill 1994 I wish to draw attention to three very important provisions. The first is the recommendation to increase penalties for those who derive profit and financial benefit from child sex tourism to match the proposed penalties in the bill for those engaging in sex with children overseas. This is a very important provision because it proves to anyone suggesting that the committee's report waters down the provisions of the bill that they are dead wrong&mdash;dead-set and totally wrong. To increase the penalties for sex tourism operators and organisers effectively targets the best practical outcome from this legislation. The exploitation of children is bad enough, but tour organisers not only exploit children; they also exploit those who have a mental illness and who are disturbed enough to engage in these activities overseas. To exploit the exploiters, in my assessment, justifies a penalty equal to the 17 years' imprisonment proposed in the bill for those engaging in sex with children overseas. This recommendation in the report beefs up the most practical aspect and penalty that can apply to make sure that these activities are not coming out of Australia and engaged in by Australian citizens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also draw the attention of the House to the important way in which the report places a better balance on community expectations that arise out of the legislation. On an emotional issue like this there is sometimes a problem. The public expectations will run way ahead and well beyond any practical capacity of any legislation to get the desired results. In many respects the number of successful prosecutions will depend on the resources provided to the Australian Federal Police and the prosecutors involved. But, most importantly, we should understand that the principle of deterrence underscores the legislation. This is also safety net legislation, not taking over the responsibilities of overseas parliaments to enact the correct legislation. I draw the attention of the House to an important part of the submission provided by the Attorney-General's Department that states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The philosophy underlying the proposed offence provisions is one of deterrence. The provisions are designed to act as a net to catch offenders who are found to have escaped the criminal justice system of the foreign country where the act has occurred. The primary responsibility for protecting children from sexual exploitation continues to rest, as it should, with the countries where the children are exploited.</PARA>
<PARA>That very important part of the submission, reflected in the report, should be made known to those organisations that have high expectations about the outcomes that will arise from the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The quote from the submission of the Attorney-General's Department also makes mention of the great responsibilities of host nations. In this respect, once the bill is reintroduced and, I am sure, passed by both houses of parliament, the government has a responsibility to adopt a regional approach to this issue, not to sit back having passed our own legislation. In all bilateral discussions and international forums we should actively urge the nations involved to take the correct action in ratifying the convention on the rights of the child and to enact in their own parliaments all the necessary legislation needed to make sure that child sex tourism occurs nowhere in the east and south Asian and South Pacific regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the attention of the House to the fact that India, Thailand, Cambodia and Laos have acceded to the convention on the rights of the child introduced by the United Nations in November 1989, but have not yet signed or ratified it. Malaysia has neither acceded to, signed nor ratified the convention. As our ministers visit these countries and engage in discussions they could do nothing better than to urge ratification of and compliance with that convention to make sure the regional approach produces effective legislation in Australia and effective outcomes in each of the host nations. I join with the other members of the committee in thanking the secretariat and the entire committee for their consideration and work. This is a report that, when adopted by the government and reintroduced into the House, will substantially improve the effectiveness and fairness of the legislation. I am sure it will be welcomed by all Australians who have a concern about this very important issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Today's debate on the study of the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill 1994 marks an important innovation. This is the first time we have followed the practice, well tried in the Senate, of referring a bill to a standing committee of this chamber during its passage through the House. It is worthwhile noting the role that the former opposition spokesperson on legal affairs, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), and the current spokesperson, Senator Vanstone, played in the decision of the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members on this side of the House have often spoken about the need for time to adequately examine the implications of legislation. We are constantly warning the government of the unintended consequences of poorly considered and drafted legislation. I welcome the opportunity we have had to consider the legislation in more detail. It is a particularly positive step to be able to review this bill, especially given the issues and the sensitivities involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been said by my friend the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), the issue of prostitution is an emotive one. When it comes to child sex, the emotions are more extreme. Everyone regards paedophilia as repulsive. The notion of child sex tourism and the carefully considered exploitation and abuse that it involves is even more repugnant. When we are faced with legislation on a matter that incites these emotional extremes, it is important that we can examine it in a calm and reasonable way. The concerns that have been raised over this bill show just how important detailed review and consideration can be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested that the bill reflects a tendency to subtly reshape our criminal justice system so that, in effect, presumption of innocence is replaced by presumption of guilt. The Queensland Law Society and the International Commission of Jurists have warned that special care must be taken to ensure that this law does not erode rights to a fair trial. Other witnesses have also echoed this view. There are fears that the many provisions of the legislation are short cuts to conviction, that the onus is on the accused to prove his or her innocence, and it has been suggested that these aspects of the bill could create opportunities for blackmail. As the report has said, it is vital that the bill uphold the legal protections afforded to accused persons which are at the heart of Australia's criminal justice system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been concerns over the costs involved in administering the bill. The Australian Federal Police Union told the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs that it believed that any law could not be enforced without a substantial increase in resources. The costs of defending a charge brought under this bill are perhaps even more concerning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of us in this parliament are already concerned that too many Australians get the justice they can afford rather than the justice they deserve. The evidence the committee received suggested that actions brought under these proposals could cost up to $400,000 to defend, leading to forecasts of two classes of defendants&mdash;those who can buy a thorough defence and those who rely on video links. There are also concerns over how it will be possible to prevent overseas coercion and enforce the laws of perjury and the like against foreign nationals in foreign countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, it is important to reiterate the report's statement that the committee has worked to produce a widely acceptable, workable and effective bill, not to water down the legislation. Three ministers&mdash;the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), the Minister for Justice, and the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley)&mdash;have already heavied the committee with a joint media release on the bill, despite the many concerns that have been expressed. It is worth noting&mdash;I remind the House that this is not the first time the Minister for Justice has failed to take the advice of the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) on an important legal issue&mdash;that not so long ago, on the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Bill, I had cause to talk to the Minister for Justice about his lack of support for the sensible views of the honourable member for Banks. It would be a great shame if ministerial standover merchants prevented further opportunities for further scrutiny of legislation when we have just learnt how it can improve such laws. </PARA>

The amendment is totally extraneous to the subject matter of the bill which relates to matters such as better benefits control measures and a legislative basis for Abstudy and the assistance for isolated children scheme. The opposition claims to support these measures but it is apparently prepared to put them at risk by introducing an additional provision which it knows must be unacceptable to the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter of the health care card provision has already been extensively aired in both chambers. The brief history of this matter is that an error in publicity material led some students to obtain Austudy on the strength of their parents or spouses holding a health care card, without the application of an assets test. Staff in the department's student assistance centres have been advised of this and the affected clients are being contacted by mail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eligible students whose parents have a health care card will be able to receive Austudy until their parents' current card expires. Then payment will stop only where family assets exceed the Austudy limits. This should ensure that students whose parents have health care cards are treated equitably. The Attorney-General's Department is being instructed to draft an amendment to the Austudy regulations to ensure that students who are paid Austudy because a parent or spouse holds a health care card and who subsequently lose their entitlement when an assets test is applied will not have an overpayment raised against them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of students receiving benefits contrary to the Austudy legislation, legal advice has been given by the Attorney-General's Department that payments made on the strength of a health care card have not been contrary to the Austudy legislation. There is no evidence that any significant numbers of families were expecting to receive benefits and have been disadvantaged. Only a handful of families who received Austudy initially because of holding a health care card have so far had to be reassessed, on expiry of the card, because of assets. I remind the House that these are families whose assets generally have a net market value in excess of $700,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, now that the government has contrived to give the matter a great deal of publicity, if it were to agree to waive the assets test for health care card holders it could be expected that many asset rich but income poor persons, not necessarily primary producers but other business people with successful tax minimisation strategies, would obtain a health care card for the sole purpose of qualifying for student assistance payments. The cost could be in excess of $10 million a year. For that reason, the government will not agree to the Senate's amendments. </PARA>

Quite clearly it is stated as official departmental policy that, if a health care card is held, the assets test which normally applies to the families of students in the situation applying for Austudy would be waived. It is that stated commitment, made in no less than five separate documents, on five separate occasions that I am aware of that we seek to hold the government to in relation to these particular amendments which were moved in the Senate. As I indicated when this bill was in the House previously, I was looking at the possibility of whether it was technically possible for these amendments to be drafted and incorporated as part of this bill. The advice was that that could be done and, therefore, the amendments were moved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that it is an indication of the seriousness of this matter that not only the opposition, in moving these amendments in the Senate, thought that the commitment which the government had made ought to be honoured but also that other parties in the Senate, on reflection, believed that this commitment ought to be honoured. For the government simply to say, as it does here again on this occasion, that it cannot afford to honour these commitments or somehow that it will lead to more people making use of this particular provision than would otherwise make use of it is simply to ignore the fact that, in the first place, it was its stated commitment that was repeated on numerous occasions to students that led to this situation coming about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not sure what the size of the problem is. The minister says again today that there is no evidence that any significant number of families would not receive the benefit because of the changes that the government has made. But, of course, one can never tell exactly what the size is. We have been told by the government on numerous occasions. First of all the government said that there was something like $25 million involved. Then it was said that it was $10 million. We were told in one estimates committee that only 100 people would be involved, and the minister has said again today that there is no evidence of any large numbers that would be involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, as the National Farmers Federation pointed out in a letter to the minister dated 27 September last year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Statistics provided to the NFF by the Department of Employment, Education and Training indicate that in 1993 only 0.16 per cent of rural students applying for Austudy failed to receive assistance because of the assets test.</PARA>
<PARA>The National Farmers Federation goes on to point out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In our view, the statistics do not give an accurate indication of the numbers of rural people who would like to undertake further education, but are unable to because of the Government's policy on asset testing.</PARA>
<PARA>That organisation points out there that we simply do not know what the numbers are. If people are told that there is a provision which is not open to them, then they will not bother to apply in the first place. Therefore, to say that we have any idea of the numbers involved is simply nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister made some comments about the fact that no overpayment notices will be made where these payments have been provided and that parents of students, where the health care card was in existence and they applied for and were granted Austudy, will be able to continue to receive Austudy until the card expires. That can create the iniquitous situation for some students whereby, if a health care card expires after a period of six months and that six months just happens to be during their educational year, they could find themselves, having made provisions or arrangements for their education, in the position where some time during that course or that year those arrangements no longer obtain and, therefore, they have to face a wholly different financial situation. If the minister had said that those students could retain Austudy at least for the period of 12 months for which they had made some arrangements in relation to their education, then it would have been a much fairer system than he has indicated will exist under the provisions which he is indicating will apply should this amendment not be passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it does not deal with the exact problem in hand. We have students, particularly in rural areas of Australia, whose educational opportunities are clearly fewer than those in other parts of the nation. For example, the rural communities in Victoria issued a report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Austudy rural inequities</EMPHASIS>, in which they pointed out that many families in rural areas of Australia have not the same educational opportunities as do their cousins in the urban and city areas of Australia. They give examples, which I will not go into tonight, of three families. Even though the families would be regarded as being in a poor situation financially, because of the operation of the income and assets tests, those children generally do not have the same opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we have reports going back to July last year. For example, there is <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rural education crisis</EMPHASIS>, which shows the percentage of total population participating in tertiary studies in different regions of Victoria. In the inner Melbourne metropolitan region it is 6.9 per cent and in the metropolitan region it is 4.4 per cent. But, when we go out to the rural areas of Victoria, in north-eastern Victoria it is 2.3 per cent; in the north Mallee, 2.4 per cent; in east Gippsland, 2.6 per cent; in the Wimmera, 2.7 per cent; in the Goulburn Valley, 2.7 per cent. The Victorian country average is only three per cent compared to an average of 4.4 per cent in the metropolitan areas. Again this quite clearly indicates the inequality in terms of access to education of students in rural areas of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1991 report of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training reported that non-metropolitan young adults are participating in higher education at one-half the rate of their metropolitan counterparts. One could adduce more evidence from the fact that it is quite clear that the opportunities for rural students to participate in tertiary and higher education, in many cases because of financial constraints, are simply not the same as they are for their rural counterparts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister may say that is an issue that ought to be addressed in other ways and that there ought to be programs in existence to ensure that that is the case. But we are saying here, quite clearly, that this is a case where there can be no question at all that there was a stated commitment&mdash;a commitment made by the department in a press release; a commitment made by the department in terms of the official publication which went to thousands upon thousands of students and their families throughout Australia; a commitment made in the application form for Austudy which, when we clearly read it, indicates that the health care card will lead to the waiving of the assets test; and in other documentation. We are simply saying here that, having made a commitment to the students of Australia and their parents, this government ought to honour that commitment and honour it in a way which is fully in line with what it said at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting, perhaps ironical, that when this matter was raised in, I think, February of this year the first response by a spokesman for the minister was that the government will attempt to honour its commitment, suggesting that it knew that it was a commitment that it had made and it was not merely, as the minister has pointed out again today, an error made by some unknown bureaucrat in the Department of Employment, Education and Training. Whether or not it was, the responsibility rests with the government because it has said quite clearly in a whole series of documents that this would be provided. It was welcomed at the time and, having been welcomed, we believe the government ought to stand by its commitment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When speaking to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1994 I think we have to take into account the white paper initiatives that are incorporated in the budget because it is a package that has tackled the most important problem facing this nation today&mdash;that is, unemployment. This package not only establishes the economic fundamentals that will set Australia on the course of continued low inflationary growth but also delivers real, immediate benefits to the people on the ground.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget contains many innovative programs, but perhaps more importantly it contains vision&mdash;vision of an Australia with a five per cent unemployment rate by the year 2000 and vision of an Australia where the long-term unemployed are assisted back into the work force. Of course, the opposition has been quite confused about this over the past few weeks. On the one hand, the former Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), told the House that the government has run up the white flag of surrender on full employment by aiming for an unemployment rate of some five per cent while, on the other hand, he said that five per cent unemployment is unattainable and should not even be aimed for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think history will record with regard to the former Leader of the Opposition that it is probably the first time in any parliament that a leader of the opposition has spoken on a budget and 10 days later been deposed by his party as leader. I will not dwell on the statements of members of the opposition because, by their own reaction to this budget, I believe they have made themselves largely irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regard the job compact as one of the most important initiatives in 11 years of Labor government. I represent an electorate with an unemployment rate of 24.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Snow)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Order! Not only are honourable members standing but they are also talking. Would they please give attention to the honourable member for Prospect. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7T4">Mrs CROSIO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition is quite irrelevant in this House so whether its members stand, talk or whatever does not worry me particularly. But I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your consideration and for bringing them back to order. As I was saying, my electorate has an unemployment rate of some 24.7 per cent, while 54.4 per cent of those unemployed people in my electorate have been out of work for more than 12 months. That compares with the national average of 45 per cent. I can assure the House that I have seen first-hand the misery that has been caused by long-term unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The social costs of the long-term unemployed are obvious. Not only do we get income from our jobs, but also we get our feeling of worth, our day-to-day reason for existence, from employment. The Australian economy is also missing out on the many years of experience that these people could bring to industry. All honourable members, I believe, would have heard stories about long-term unemployed people who are well qualified for jobs they are applying for but are overlooked because many employers feel that, because they have been unemployed for a long period of time, there must be something wrong with them. The job compact is a way to reintroduce the long-term unemployed to the work force. This is a very worthwhile and vital role for an effective government in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By instituting the job compact the government is sending an important message&mdash;that employment in modern Australia is a right. It is a message that is fundamental to any social democracy. This government has really met objectives in delivering the goods for the long-term unemployed. I was very pleased to read an article by Geoff Kitney in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 4 May. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The job compact is a bold and imaginative concept that seeks to deal with a problem that no one has been able to deal with effectively.</PARA>
<PARA>When Mr Kitney said that no-one has been able to deal with the problem effectively he was, of course, including overseas governments. I was pleased to note that he was including governments based in the United States as well as in the United Kingdom. We are acting bravely and compassionately in helping the long-term unemployed. Our economy and our society will be the better for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of individual case management is an important initiative. Unemployed people could not be blamed for sometimes thinking that they are just another statistic. It will be an enormous help for these people to have one contact, with the CES or other employment agency, which knows their case, who cares about them and who particularly takes on board the best way in which to assist them back into the work force. With the establishment of case management this will now be the reality of many clients who are presently registered with the CES. Those who are involved in the job compact, those in the youth training initiative, or those who are regarded as a high risk of becoming long-term unemployed will have an individual plan of assistance drawn up for them and will have their progress monitored by an individual officer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was particularly pleased to see that the government has set the target of some 50,000 new apprenticeships and traineeship places by the year 1995-96. History has shown that an economic downturn does have severe effects on apprenticeships. The Carmichael report noted that it took until 1986-87 for apprenticeships to recover to their pre-1981 recession levels. That is why I was particularly pleased to see that the government is promoting the extra apprenticeship and traineeship places. Even though industry may be reducing places on the ground because of incapacity to pay, the economy would be suffering from a very serious skills shortage for years to come if apprenticeships were not increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extra places will be created, I am pleased to say, in a number of ways. Employers will be given more incentive to take on those apprentices and trainees. Employer payments will be increased from their current levels to make it more worth while for employers to take on apprentices. In addition, the government will provide increased funding of $1.1 billion over a four-year period, 1993-97, to increase the number of TAFE places that are provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A large number of apprentices are employees of state governments, and state governments must seriously consider the human ramifications of cuts in apprenticeships. I would ask them to consider entering into the spirit of the Commonwealth's initiatives in promoting extra places for our young people. Other initiatives will see the jobsearch allowance for people under 18 replaced with the youth training allowance. The youth training allowance will be paid when the individual is undertaking training as well as looking for work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A whole range of economic and social factors have led to a reduction in the demand for unskilled workers. The shift away from the primary and manufacturing sectors towards the service sector means that employers are demanding young workers with some training in the service industry. In addition, the advent of new technology means that the entry level jobs that used to be taken up by our young people are now very much different. The fax machine, for example, has certainly made the messenger boy redundant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that changes in the world economy mean that people entering the work force for the very first time must be well trained if they are to have a chance. The youth training initiatives give them that chance. The national training wage will also greatly encourage employers to hire more workers as well as contributing to making Australia one of the most skilled nations in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Economic analysts show that employers will not hire more staff just because wages come down. But, with the training wage initiative, employers not only have reduced the cost of hiring but also know that they will have a better trained work force and the benefits that flow on from improved training. The ACTU and many employer groups have endorsed the national training wage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will understand my intense interest in this subject when I share with them the following quote from a brief on unemployment in my electorate that came from a document from the office of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon). It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Fairfield region has felt the greatest impact of retrenchment from the manufacturing and construction industries in the south west Sydney area. The group which has been most affected by these retrenchments is the unskilled labourers who are likely to face difficulties in the economic upturn when competing for jobs amongst job seekers who have better skills.</PARA>
<PARA>I applaud any initiative which assists relatively unskilled people back into the work force. I particularly congratulate all ministers who were involved with and responsible for this package. As mentioned in the budget, there are a number of changes to the actual social security system as we know it. I have always believed that the welfare system, no matter how good it is, must change to meet the changing times and we also must recognise if there are anomalies within it and take action to correct them. However, changes to social security recently announced by the government represent a very significant improvement to the system. A new situation calls for a new policy. We all know that the labour market has gone through enormous changes since the social security system was founded, and it is only natural that the system should be reshaped to suit the new situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that part-time jobs are increasingly popular both amongst employers and prospective employees. It is also an undeniable fact that many people take on part-time or casual work as they wait for full-time work. The recently announced changes, I am pleased to say, recognise this reality and have made it financially worth while for unemployed people to accept part-time work. The new parenting allowance to be introduced from July 1995 is a very innovative and worthwhile initiative. The parenting allowance will reintroduce an element of choice for many families, allowing one parent to stay at home and care for the children. One parent will receive the parenting allowance free of any obligation to seek work. The payment will be available to low income families and families where one of the partners is unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parenting allowance will have a particularly large impact on my electorate of Prospect. One-third of the residents of the city of Fairfield, which covers most of my electorate, are younger than 18. The female labour force participation rate in Fairfield is 58.4 per cent, and the state average is 64.8 per cent. It is obvious that the parenting allowance will benefit my electorate of Prospect greatly because the high percentage of parents who are already staying at home to care for their children will gain that extra benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More evidence of the positive effect that the parenting allowance will have on families within my electorate can be obtained from figures on family income. As the publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Families in Fairfield</EMPHASIS> by the Ettinger House Fairfield Family Resource Centre pointed out, 16.9 per cent of two-parent families with one dependant in Fairfield earn between $12,000 and $20,000 a year. The corresponding average for New South Wales is only 11.5 per cent, so any proposal to assist low income families with one parent staying at home is great news for my people. In this the International Year of the Family, what better initiative could there be? It is a very practical and valuable effort which shows that our government's commitment to the family is greater than mere words. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another initiative in the budget that I am sure all honourable members will join me in welcoming is, of course, the recognition of Australia's World War II mariners. I know of many people within my electorate who served in an indirect capacity in World War II, whether it was as a merchant mariner, a member of the Women's Land Army, or even as someone who took an active part in the defence of Darwin. The simple fact is that World War II was a time when the efforts of every single individual were required to be maximised to ensure our survival as a nation and the survival of our freedom. Not everyone could be directly involved in the so-called war action, but all the people who contributed their efforts in World War II were heroes. They were nothing less than heroes, and they deserve our continuing thanks and support. The budget announcement that World War II merchant mariners would be covered by the Veterans' Entitlements Act is a very practical way of showing them our thanks for what they have done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also very pleased with a number of the health measures within our budget. I was particularly delighted with the allocation for extra funding for the fight against breast cancer. I recently had the pleasure of welcoming to my electorate of Prospect the federally funded mobile breast cancer screening unit, which is now located in Fairfield for a number of months. I would like to thank particularly the two local papers in my electorate, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fairfield City Champion</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fairfield Advance</EMPHASIS>, for publicising this service and letting women avail themselves of the opportunity to be screened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also delighted that more funds have been allocated for the fight against breast cancer. It is, of course, an insidious disease that spreads through every part of Australian society. It is a disease that every woman in Australia is at risk of contracting. One in 16 Australian women will contract breast cancer during her lifetime. There are 5,000 new cases detected every year and 2,000 Australian women die of this disease each year. I refuse to accept that these deaths cannot be prevented. The allocation for breast cancer screening has been increased by $14 million in the 1994-95 budget, bringing the total funding to $41.8 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also very pleased with the grant of $1 million per year for the next three years to a foundation to be administered by the Cancer Society to raise funds for breast cancer research. The government will also encourage private contributions by matching any private donation dollar for dollar up to a further $1 million per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing I do regret, however, is that this issue has to be, to a certain extent, and has become, a political football between state and federal governments. An issue such as this should be above politics. I was glad to see the Premier of New South Wales welcome the increased allocation in the budget by our government for breast cancer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another major initiative in the health field which received a substantial allocation in this budget is the national prevention strategy for child abuse and neglect. Twelve million dollars have been allocated to this program over four years. For too long child abuse has been treated with ad hoc programs which do not have prevention as their major aim. Child abuse is one of the major problems facing this country. There are 50,000 reported cases of suspected child abuse every year. The government must continue to do everything in its power to protect the most helpless members of our society, our children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, it is obvious that child abuse has ramifications for the individuals involved and for society for years to come. Drug abuse, homelessness, juvenile crime and mental illness are all partially caused and connected to child abuse. I sincerely hope that this program can assist in the drive to reduce Australia's depressingly high rate of youth suicide. I am glad to see that the strategy is the result of cooperation between non-government agencies and all three levels of government. It will require all energies to be harnessed in an effective way to overcome this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget takes on tough issues&mdash;issues like long-term unemployment and child abuse. This budget ensures that the recovery will be shared between all of us. The 1994 budget is an imaginative budget, in contrast to what the opposition would have given us. The government had the imagination and ability to deliver the compact which will ease the long-term unemployed back into the work force. The government has delivered a training wage which reduces cost and improves the skills base of our work force. It provides young people with programs to improve training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has the imagination to modernise the social security system, to improve the incentive for the unemployed to take part-time work. The government has introduced the parenting allowance to give a boost to low income families in the Year of the Family. The government has delivered policies that try to solve in an integrated and inclusive way the problems that this nation is facing. The budget and the white paper on the commitment given by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on election night last year that we would get the unemployed back into work and we would look after them in the meantime certainly deliver. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget delivers benefits to people in electorates like my electorate of Prospect. To the long-term unemployed, to young people looking for training, to families on low incomes and to women it delivers continued economic growth. It shares that growth with the less fortunate in our society. It is a budget of which this government can be justly proud. The challenge is now to ensure that the programs contained in the budget are implemented in such a way so as to maximise fairness and efficiency. It is up to us to ensure that the targets set will now be met. It is a challenge that this government is capable of meeting. I commend the budget and the package to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;ATSIC is a much maligned body. It has become a punching bag for almost every problem in indigenous affairs. ATSIC has been operational for only four years, so we can scarcely expect it to have solved the problems two centuries of European settlement has created. Unfortunately, it makes for an easy target by its very nature, the real failure in indigenous affairs and the lack of coordination between different levels of government, agencies and individuals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Chairman of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs Standing Committee today said, `The infrastructure responsibilities of the Commonwealth, the states, territories and local government are unclear.' The standing committee believes that ATSIC is funding services that should be provided by other levels of government and once again wants to see action taken to stop this waste of resources. However, the committee is divided over the level of accountability of the use of resources by regional councils. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian National Audit Office has recommended that ATSIC encourage regional councils to document reasons for funding. It has been claimed by government members of the committee that this would impose bureaucratic accountability for political decisions that regional councils have been elected to make. Further, the majority of the committee reports that the ANAO has sought to establish itself as an arbiter of the appropriateness of regional council decisions, imposing conditions on political decisions not applied to any other level of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition members of the committee agree that the ANAO has no right to review the spending priorities selected by regional councils. However, we believe the decision making process over the allocation of funds should be more open. Question marks have been raised over the effectiveness of regional councils in getting money to the areas of real need in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are claims that funds are sometimes allocated on the basis of nepotism. Having to give reasons for funding decisions when they deviate from the regional plan will ensure that the regional councils cannot be properly criticised unless there is a good reason to do so. So it is in the regional council's interest to give reasons for funding decisions. Apart from anything else, it is commonsense when dealing with public money to give reasons why programs have been funded. Although this is not relevant to the report, if the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) had been required to give reasons for funding, she would still be a minister today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Serious allegations have been made over ATSIC's spending. In one case, it has been claimed that ATSIC funds were used by the Anyinginyi Aboriginal Health Congress in Tennant Creek to provide bogus salary payments to non-existent staff and on personal expenditure covering everything from furniture to meals. Peter Shergold, the Chief Executive of ATSIC, told the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program earlier this month that around five cases of spending irregularities are currently before state or federal governments. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program quoted an independent report, the Daffen report, which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of the top level staff in ATSIC lack experience. The economics and commercial staff are unskilled with no background in their respective areas, with the result that performance on land management and commercial matters is extremely poor.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The lack of executive control has led to a major blow-out in staff numbers and salaries, with total lack of direction and purpose.</PARA>
<PARA>It recommends that 50 per cent of senior staff positions in the central office be abolished and the money saved used to place staff in regions&mdash;in all, a total loss of 140 Canberra based positions or 30 per cent of its senior office staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have already been claims that the government has lost confidence in ATSIC and that it prefers to work through the Office of Indigenous Affairs in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. As the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) says, the Daffen report endorsed the coalition's policy at the last election. Perhaps the minister will recognise that in due course. ATSIC is doing important work but, if it is to remain credible, accountability at all levels remains vital. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take this opportunity to add to the comments of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the former Leader of the Opposition on 12 May in congratulating and paying tribute to the former Australian cricket captain, Allan Border. The statistics on Allan Border do not need repeating, apart from the fact that he is the highest test run scorer, with 11,174 runs. He also played the most test matches, 156, and played the most as captain. I think the most remarkable statistic amongst all that is that, despite playing so many test matches, he still had a test batting average of over 50, which is in itself remarkable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the most distinctive and memorable characteristic of Allan Border was his fighting qualities&mdash;his ability to go out under adversity and rescue Australia so many times when the team was in trouble. Basically, his fighting, gutsy qualities really make him the personification of the little Aussie battler. I think it is those qualities and the way that they were shown so many times on the test cricket field that people will most remember about Allan Border.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have an additional memory of Allan Border. I can recall in January 1971 playing a game against him. It was one of his very first matches for the Mosman cricket club in Sydney. I was a youngster playing for the northern district club. I recall opening the bowling and taking the first wicket. Then this very short, little left-hander came in to bat at No. 3 and I thought, `You beauty, I will knock this bloke over. He does not look like too much of a problem.' I nearly did, too. The first ball or two nearly got through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am afraid to say that after that he treated my bowling in much the same way as he has treated most other bowlers around the world. He gave me a bit of a touch up and I was banished to the deep backward square leg boundary. Unfortunately, on this particular ground there was a very short boundary and a leg spinner came on to bowl and kept dropping the ball short. This little left-hander named A. Border kept bashing the ball straight at me. Those who have ever fielded behind square leg in a cricket match will know that if the ball bounces in front of a person it usually spins past into the fence. That is exactly what happened to me. The only saving grace for me that day was that my team won the game, despite Allan Border scoring 50-odd runs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Talking of northern district, my former club, I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the new Australian captain, Mark Taylor. Mark still plays for northern district, the club that he joined in September 1981. At that stage I was probably a lower grade captain and a selector at the club. I can recall at an early season training session being asked to go and bowl to this new player&mdash;also a left-hander, of course&mdash;in the nets. I went over and bowled a few overs to him and he looked pretty good as well. Of course, I would say that is proved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was just talking to the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) a minute ago. I remember that on that day in 1981 I had to leave practice early and go off somewhere else because it was the day of the New South Wales state election. I was handing out cards for the Labor candidate for the North Shore, against whom the current federal member for North Sydney was running. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mark Taylor will be a fine Australian captain. He has scored 4,275 runs at an average not much under 50. I believe that is a fine record, and it well get even better as he goes on. I congratulate Mark Taylor. I believe the change in leadership of the Australian cricket team will be a lot more successful than that other well-publicised leadership change on the opposition benches a few days ago. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to finish off the speech on the family that I was responding to this morning in relation to the motion of the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) in which I was defining the family and how it has changed over the last 30 or 40 years. Technology has changed the whole concept of family, and people are much more mobile than they used to be. Television links us to the rest of the world within minutes of things happening. All this means that new ideas are constantly being fed into society, and this has an effect on the role of the family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our challenge in government is to keep up with those changes and to provide a safety net for those who are not adapting to them easily. We need to look at our education system to ensure that children are being equipped properly for finding meaningful employment and we need to look at the use of leisure time now and in the next century. We need to find adequate ways of ensuring that all the different family groupings can be properly and securely housed with access to transport and employment. We must also understand the new spiritual needs of people in this changing world. Many religions have already started down the track of understanding this change, but society is still dragging its feet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The federal government is pursuing all these directions through specific programs, such as family skills training and family mediation, as well as through broader schemes, such as jobtrain and jobskills, plus the range of programs announced in the white paper. This government is dealing with the whole, not sectioning off parts of artificially created groups that once may have fitted into somebody's model. We have to get away from the conservative view of family, because we are not only denying those outside this view but also ignoring an economic unit that deserves much higher recognition than it is getting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The household sector is the forgotten economy of the Western world. Government cannot make policy on matters such as unemployment relief and taxation if half the family and a third of the total economy are ignored. We need to open our minds a little and broaden our family image. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Family can mean a household, a street, a community or larger. It really means that we should care for our fellows, especially when they are in difficulty, and then rejoice with them in their successes. I believe that the motion the honourablemember for Deakin put forward this morning is not relevant in today's society. I hope that it is buried in the mists of time that it came from. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of regional Australia's leading academic institutions has recently undertaken a quantum leap in regional tertiary education. The University of Central Queensland, now called the Central Queensland University, has taken a new name and corporate identity to reflect its strong and unique partnership with the flourishing Central Queensland region. Covering nearly a third of Queensland, its unique structure allows for five campuses. Two of them are in my electorate of Hinkler and one is in the electorate of my colleague the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The university's new corporate image features a coat of arms emphasising that link in a number of ways. The central focus of this emblem is a pale-headed rosella clutching a Byfield fern. The pale-headed rosella, a native of Central Queensland, carries the CQU's new colours of gold, blue and green. The byfield fern, also unique to Central Queensland, is found around the Shoalwater Bay area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arms also include an open book&mdash;that of learning&mdash;and a gold sun, representing the Tropic of Capricorn. CQU's motto, `Doctrina Perpetua'&mdash;Always Learning&mdash;is apt when we consider the university's progress over the last 27 years. It has grown from the Queensland Institute of Technology (Capricornia) in 1967 to the Capricornia Institute of Advanced Education in 1971 and then to the University College of Central Queensland, during which time I was privileged to be a member of its council. It achieved full university status in September 1991. It is a remarkable achievement and it mirrors the spectacular growth in the agricultural, mining, tourism and manufacturing industries in the region over the same period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Central Queensland University has developed as an integrated regional university with campuses at Rockhampton, Gladstone, Bundaberg, Mackay and Emerald. While to some this structure may seem to weaken the institution, to the contrary, it has strengthened the university and its support within the wider central community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the research field, the CQU has formed a number of important cooperative ventures with the CSIRO, the DPI and others, including the Koala Research Centre, the Tropical Beef Centre and the Mariculture Research and Training Centre. It is worth noting that the CQU's academic links have also extended well beyond Central Queensland to the Middle East and Asia. The university's international experience has also been used to benefit local companies looking to expand offshore through the International Business Exchange of Central Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Briefly, I would like to bring to the attention of the House some exciting developments in relation to CQU's two campuses in the Hinkler electorate, with the opening of facilities at both Bundaberg and Gladstone in the near future. This week, after five years of temporary accommodation, the first classes will be held in Bundaberg's new $2.5 million campus, although the complex will not be opened until 22 July. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New facilities, such as a 200-seat lecture theatre, air-conditioned tutorial rooms, specific teaching laboratories and extensive landscaping add a new dimension to tertiary education in Bundaberg. The Bundaberg campus currently caters for 150 full-time students, with others in part-time and external studies offering first-year degree courses in arts, business and education, and soon information technology. Students may then complete their remaining two years at the main campus in Rockhampton or elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, Gladstone, with a student body of 600&mdash;110 full-time, 70 part-time and 420 external&mdash;is undergoing expansion in both physical and academic senses. The new campus, set spectacularly on the Gladstone Marina, becomes operational this Friday, 3 June, and takes its first undergraduates next month. In line with Gladstone's strong industrial base, the local campus has a focus on engineering, technology and environmental management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government has provided $3 million for a new engineering complex which should commence construction around August or September. As well, the government has agreed to build a second engineering building. Together, they will enable Gladstone campus to offer both maintenance and process engineering experiences. I commend the government on these initiatives and trust the commitments it has given to Gladstone and the university will all be honoured. Currently, Gladstone offers first-year degree courses in engineering and information technology, as well as arts, business and education. It also has a course of associate diploma in electrical engineering, vital to Gladstone's expansion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Community support for both campuses is reflected in a determined fundraising effort to create two libraries. Committees in both centres have set themselves targets of $1 million plus, a reflection both of community empathy and the enhancement of academic opportunity. Finally, I would like to say that just half an hour ago&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak on a few subjects tonight. During the recess, forwarded to my parliamentary office was a document called `From the Privacy Act: Personal Information Digest from the Human Rights Australia Privacy Commissioner'. It is significant that this digest is over 450 pages in length. When we are talking about privacy, it is rather revealing to understand how many people have access to other people's records. The Privacy Commissioner is there to ensure that this information is kept private, within those acts. I was rather surprised today to coincidentally receive a letter from a group of constituents, a firm of chartered accountants, who said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I enclose a copy of a remittance advice and cheque received on behalf of one of our clients from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Unit. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This may not sound strange however our client is neither aboriginal nor a student.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An enquiry of an officer of the department concerned stated that mine was the second telephone call he had received today in relation to cheques which had apparently be forwarded in error.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem apparently occurred when their computer accessed data bases within the government computers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our client is listed with both the Taxation Office and the Department of Primary Industries . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This matter raises serious concerns.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe it does, too. Although in this case the person had no relationship whatsoever with the program, he is to receive a cheque for $168.50. A person of less integrity might just have cashed it. The address for the service of the particular notice was that of the tax agent concerned, so there must have been a link-up between the tax office and the computers of this program of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education unit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of grave concern when we are assured by the Privacy Commissioner in sending out this booklet that this type of thing would not happen. It is not the first time this has happened. I recently had cause for some concern about the Taxation Office when a constituent received somebody else's information. That other person obviously received the first person's information. I believe it requires more than a digest of what can happen and who has access, to make sure that the privacy of every Australian, particularly of our taxation records, is kept in the manner it should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could not let this opportunity pass without mentioning probably the greatest game of football that I have seen in my lifetime in the State of Origin last Monday. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0F4">Mr BRAITHWAITE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Friday night is another matter. I believe Illawarra only won with the great effort by that Queenslander Fritz and his forward play. It was a most exciting episode from that point of view but not from any other.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not in connection with trying to blow the trumpet of the maroons that I want to speak, although as a Queenslander I thought it was a fine spectacle, particularly the last five minutes, when the Queensland team showed its depth and determination and won the game. Probably the most exciting was the last play and the nine passes that took the game from about three-quarters of the field from one side to the other and provided that touchdown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard the comment from many a New South Welshman that if it were not for the two forward passes and the double movement, as they then suggested it was, maybe we would not have got away with it. I take their minds back to last year's episode, when a try similarly scored by Queensland was disallowed. So the fate of the game depends very much on fate itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The game was significant for a couple of reasons. First of all, nobody in the papers has commented on the fact that there were no brawls within that game. That would be the first time I have seen such a State of Origin. People have commented in connection with the refereeing decisions. I saw some bad decisions made. But people forget that the wisdom they get by being able to stop the camera and see a person onside or offside or a phase of play is not available to either the linesman or the referee at that time. It is a split second decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that Queensland's faith in the referee was tested&mdash;and it proved to be right&mdash;in that he was a New South Welshman. I give credit in those areas. I think Mal Meninga and Laurie Daley are two of the finest sportsmen around. We heard about Allan Border earlier tonight, but I give credit to those two fine sportsmen, as well as to the stage of play, the linesman and the referee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue of air safety has been highlighted not only by the crash of the DC3 at Kingsford Smith and the Monarch Air disaster last year but also by the kaleidoscope of policy changes in the management of airports, air safety procedures and the provision of aviation infrastructure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The anticipated growth in air traffic of at least six per cent in Sydney for the next few years and the spectre of privatisation of airports mean that the problems of safety will move to unimagined levels of complexity. The rhetoric of the generally excellent record of Australian air safety ignores the benefits of relatively uncluttered skies and good weather rather than outstanding management or sound government policy. Given the controversial nature of air safety and issues such as Badgerys Creek and the third runway at Sydney, the rhetoric of public and parliamentary debate is often extreme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was unfortunate that in debating the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1994 the contributions of the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) and the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) contained a number of incorrect, superficial and highly damaging personal accusations. In relation to the DC3 crash, the honourable member for Fadden repeated incorrect press statements that `no air safety regulations governed the operation of that particular DC3's flight'. This was quite wrong. There are many regulations applicable. With the Bureau of Air Safety and the Civil Aviation Authority currently investigating, it is irresponsible to prejudge and raise public alarm based on superficial press comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Statements such as `aircraft flying over water should be within a one-hour range of alternative landing' are again superficial and wrong. The suggestions by the honourable member for Fadden that nothing is being done about aviation administration and that the CAA is to blame are highly destructive. Many external and internal reviews have been and are taking place, including those by the Safety Forum, Mr Terrell, Sypher Meuller, Dr Ratner, and Coopers and Lybrand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I can understand the feelings of the honourable member for Hume on this subject, his naming of CAA officers such as the South-East Regional Flying Operations Manager, Mr Baston, and Mary O'Brien was unnecessary and an abuse of parliamentary privilege. Mr Baston, in particular, has a proud and successful 40-year career in the aviation industry, including 18 years in the RAAF. Mary O'Brien has been involved for 30 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should be particularly careful in reflecting on the professional reputations of individuals. Contrary to the allegations of the honourable member for Hume, a great deal of action took place with regard to Monarch Air and prejudging the outcomes of investigations by the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, the Civil Aviation Authority and the Coronial inquiry has no public benefit. Again, allegations that an airworthiness inspector who recommended grounding Western Airlines in Wagga Wagga in 1993 was sidelined for this action are, I am informed, incorrect. These accusations should be referred to the Australian Federation of Airline Pilots and the Regional Airlines Association to establish the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The naming of people in parliament and media trials are no way to address flight safety issues, particularly when the due process of the correct forums is proceeding. I have no brief for the CAA but, while it is responsible for enforcing regulations, these regulations and policies are set by governments. In addition, the CAA does not service or fly planes. If it grounded every aircraft for breach or suspicion of breach of regulations, then every airline in Australia would stop. No doubt dozens of members would be on their feet emoting outrage at the bureaucratic frustration of commercial operations. There is no question that, as the honourable member for Hume stated, the financial status of operators is a major factor in maintenance, manning and safety, but his suggestion that the CAA should take this into consideration is misplaced, when regulations clearly prevent such action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally, it is outrageous that successive governments have refused to take effective actions concerning airline insurance. The anger and frustration of CAA personnel must be understood at the unsubstantiated comments of members implying corruption and incompetence, when the air safety budget has been cut by close to 50 per cent. The safety division has seen a reduction from 700 to 500 staff in the last two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no question that, given safety funding cuts, deregulation, privatisation, the growth of air traffic and the inevitable problems ensured by the intensification of air traffic in Sydney with runways carefully aligned with a major oil refinery and the densest population in Australia, a major review of air safety is required. This needs a royal commission or at least a specific parliamentary inquiry, not just parliamentary rhetoric. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2)(a)-(b) With respect to the 1992/93 income year, a person with an accumulated HECS debt and a taxable income of less than $27 748 would not be required to make a repayment for that year, while a person with an accumulated HECS debt of at least $560 and a taxable income of $28 000 would be required to make a repayment of $560 towards the HECS debt as part of the person's income tax assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2)(b)(i) The deferred option of the Higher Education Contribution Scheme ensures that people with an accumulated HECS debt are not required to repay any part of their HECS Debt until they can afford to do so. Ability to repay is measured by taxable income. While the person whose taxable income is below the threshold does not have to make a repayment, the person's HECS debt remains to be repaid in future years and is indexed to movements in the consumer price index to maintain its real value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2)(b)(ii) The Government does not propose to change the basic structure where accumulated HECS debts are repayable where taxable income exceeds certain thresholds. The minimum taxable income thresholds for HECS repayments for 1993-94 have been adjusted in line with changes to average weekly earnings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) As part of an explanation on when accumulated HECS debts have to be repaid, the information sheet states that a person with a taxable income of $30 000 would have to repay a maximum of $600 towards an accumulated HECS debt as part of the person's income tax assessment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Celebrate Australia Promotion in Japan was an initiative of the Australia Abroad Council implemented by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the question originally directed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts on Celebrate Australia has been passed to me as the Minister responsible for this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) In August 1991 the Australia Abroad Council asked the Embassy in Tokyo to examine the feasibility of conducting a major promotion in Japan and to recommend a strategy for an event best suited to Japan. This was undertaken by the Ambassador and a group of senior officers in the Tokyo Embassy, in consultation with the Embassy's Information Coordination Committee, consisting of representatives of Australian agencies and corporations in Japan and State Government representatives. A detailed strategy for a major promotion in Japan in November 1993 was prepared by the Embassy in December 1991.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) No. The entire Celebrate Australia program was designed by the Celebrate Australia Management Unit  (CAMU), established within the Tokyo Embassy in early 1992 to build and manage a diverse program of component events in accordance with a strategy devised by the Embassy in December 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a), (b) and (c) N/A. See Answer to Question 8 above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) Celebrate Australia, as was widely reported, consisted of 100 major events in 33 centres around Japan. As listed in the official program, component events came under the broad headings of business, visual arts, performing arts, education and technology, entertainment and sport and people-to-people exchanges. In addition, I am advised that the publicity momentum achieved in Japan by the organisers of Celebrate Australia resulted in scores of smaller events organised spontaneously at the local level during November 1993, often by Australian expatriates, such as teachers, and in several cases with financial backing of local government and local business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) The exact amounts expended for Celebrate Australia by the different Commonwealth departments and agencies is set out in the answer to question 5 (a) above. I am advised that additional amounts expended on individual events by other companies and organisations ranged greatly, from just a few thousand dollars to several millions. Many events were organised by the Japanese side with various parties, such as sponsors, promoters and importers, contributing in cash or kind. Those costs are not known.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) No. There was extensive media coverage in Japan of nearly all events in Celebrate Australia, including positive reviews of a number of cultural events. The Embassy in Tokyo holds a publicity log compiled before, during and after Celebrate Australia which records more than 370 separate items of Japanese print and electronic media coverage of Celebrate Australia. The Australian Ballet itself received excellent reviews in all of Japan's major daily newspapers and in a wide range of high-quality specialist magazines. The most noteworthy of these reviews were in Japan's three largest national daily newspapers:</PARA>

The CAMU had overall responsibility for the running of Celebrate Australia, though it did not directly select performers. This was done, in some cases, by Japanese promoters and, in others, by individual event organisers and promoters in consultation with Australian booking agencies.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Australian Government has a long-term commitment to a position of opposition to all whaling and to seeking a ban on all commercial whaling, while recognising that some traditional communities continue to require access to whaling and whale products to meet traditional cultural and subsistence needs. With bipartisan support, the Government has continued to support the International Whaling Commission (IWC) and its scientific committee as the appropriate international organisation through which to pursue conservation of all species of whales, dolphins and porpoises. The Australian representatives to the IWC have been instrumental in achieving support for all of the major conservation decisions taken by the Commission in recent years. We will continue that active pursuit of the Government's objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The recent IWC meeting was not a conference to discuss the resumption of commercial whaling. It was an intersessional technical meeting of an IWC working group to discuss the proposed sanctuary in the Southern Ocean. It was held on Norfolk Island from 20-24 February 1994 at the invitation of this Government, to ensure continued action on the sanctuary initiative. The working group's task was to examine a number of outstanding legal, political, geographic and ecological issues relating to establishment of a sanctuary in the Southern Ocean and to prepare a report and recommendations for consideration at the 46th Annual Meeting of the IWC, which will be held in Mexico in May this year.</PARA>

Delegates of the twenty-six IWC member countries attending were welcomed on behalf of the Government, by the Hon Janice Crosio MP, representing the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, and by the President of the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly on behalf of that body and the Norfolk Island community. In Mrs Crosio's welcome, the Government's continued opposition to the resumption of commercial whaling was made clear, as was its strong support for implementation of a sanctuary in the Southern Ocean.</PARA>

The trial allowed customers taking up the "ReachOut" option to make untimed calls to exchanges within a radius of 75 kilometres from Campbelltown at a cost of 35 cents per call.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Shadow Minister for Finance</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CANBERRA  ACT  2600</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Costello</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 14 February 1994 in which you reaffirmed your request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOI) 1982 to access to all documents held by this Department relating to the Community, Cultural, Recreation and Sporting Facilities Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your initial request of 1 December 1993 was in relation to all documents relating to both the Community Recreation and Sporting Facilities Program and the Community Cultural, Recreational and Sporting Facilities Program and it will be assumed, unless you advise otherwise, that your request relates to both programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the commencement of the investigation of your request it was realised that besides documents in the Defence and Industry Division and Resource Management Improvement Branch, there are also documents in the Expenditure Policy Branch. To locate, examine and make a decision on the documents that exist in the Expenditure Policy Branch of this Department would involve a substantial and unreasonable diversion of resources. In effect it is estimated that some 140 hours of work would be necessary to locate the potentially very few relevant documents on some 160 files covering a period of five years. Because of the demands placed on the Expenditure Policy Branch in particular in the coordination of the Budget, it would be unreasonable to expect their resources to be diverted to the FOI request.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the nature of the work of the Expenditure Policy Branch, the documents would largely be cabinet documents in which there was a reference to this program in the context of a new expenditure or savings proposal. This information would be in documents already on files in the Defence and Industry Division, in respect of which Mr Winder would be making a decision under the Act, and in any event would be highly likely to be exempt under Section 34 of the FOI Act because of Cabinet confidentiality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As indicated in the telephone discussion of 7 March between Mr Winder, First Assistant Secretary, Defence and Industry Division and Mr Davey, your Economic Adviser, because of the abovementioned problems involved in the inclusion of the documents in Expenditure Policy Branch in your request, it is necessary to refuse access under Section 24(1) of the FOI Act. It is therefore requested that you contact Mr Winder (ph. 2633454) with a view to making the request in a form that would remove the grounds for refusal (Section 24(6)(c) of the FOI Act refers). In accordance with Section 24(7) of the Act, the period commencing on the day you are given this notice concerning the intention of refusal and ending on the day you confirm or alter the request following consultation is disregarded in the computation of the 30 day statutory period for notification of a decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In accordance with departmental guidelines and the guidelines set down in the Attorney General's Department revised FOI memorandum No 29 of 4 November 1992, your request for remission of the fees and charges was referred to the Minister for Finance for consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister subsequently determined that, taking into account the provisions of Section 29 of the Act, the matters listed in the aforementioned memorandum, and the contents of your letters of 1 December 1993 and 24 February 1994, remission of the charges was not warranted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision was based on the fact that the documents held in Finance relate almost entirely to administrative arrangements, in particular in respect of the annual appropriation for the program. Other documents relate to this Department's view of the adequacy of the methodology of the evaluation program. There are also documents belonging to the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories which are the subject of your FOI request to that Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was considered that making the content of the documents held by Finance more widely available would not contribute valuable material to the public debate and therefore not be in the public interest. It was also considered that the documents have little or no bearing on the central context of the debate on the administration of the grants process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Attorney General's guidelines indicate that consideration should be given to remission of fees and charges where the information is of a kind that would customarily be provided in an answer to a Parliamentary Question or if the information contained in a document would normally be provided to a Member of Parliament in accordance with the "Government Guidelines for Official Witnesses before Parliamentary Committees and Related Matters". It is not considered that the information falls into either of these categories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You should note that the Minister's decision to refuse to remit the charges is not subject to internal review. In accordance with Section 55 of the Act you may however apply within 60 days to the Administrative Appeal Tribunal for a review of the decision that you are liable to pay a charge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Should you agree to the narrowing of your request as detailed above (ie. excluding the Expenditure Policy Branch documents), my preliminary assessment of the charge, calculated in accordance with Section 29 of the Act is as follows:</PARA>
