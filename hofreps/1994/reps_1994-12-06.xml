<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I want to report to the House on the results of the second informal meeting of the leaders of the APEC economies, which I attended in Bogor, Indonesia, on 15 November. It is not overstating the case to suggest that the Bogor meeting and the Declaration of Common Resolve which leaders issued afterwards have permanently changed the nature of our region and the future of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For nearly 40 years, Australians have spoken loosely about what we have called `our region' of the world. We have regularly talked about our `northern neighbours'. But until now these phrases have been statements of aspiration&mdash;or hollow cliches&mdash;rather than descriptions of reality and real national intent. What our region was, where it extended, who was in it, whether the others we claimed as partners accepted that role, was always uncertain&mdash;indeed unknowable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With Bogor, however, Australians can say for the first time that the region around us is truly our region. We know its shape; we have an agreed institutional structure; we share with its other members a common agenda for change. Historical turning points like this are rare and, like phantoms, they are seen more often than they are found to exist. But I am certain that the Bogor meeting will be seen as such a turning point&mdash;as the beginning of the Pacific century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as the Bretton Woods agreements after the Second World War established structures in the IMF and the World Bank which enabled the world to grow and prosper, so in APEC we have established a model which will serve the interests of the post Cold War world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It brings together in one multilateral framework a grouping which by 2020 will include, according to some estimates, seven of the world's 10 largest economies and which, by the end of the century, will account for 57 per cent of world trade. It gives all the economies of this region&mdash;developed, newly industrialised and developing&mdash;a stake in a cooperative enterprise whose aim is to maintain the dynamism and growth in this part of the world. It offers business people the opportunity to plan with confidence as governments work to remove unnecessary blockages to trade and investment. It engages the United States, China and Japan in a structure which minimises the danger that trade frictions will eventually lead to strategic tension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Between my arrival in Jakarta on 13 November and my departure on 16 November, I held bilateral discussions with Prime Minister Chretien of Canada, Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia, President Jiang Zemin of China, Prime Minister Chuan of Thailand, President Clinton of the United States, President Suharto of Indonesia, President Ramos of the Philippines and Prime Minister Bolger of New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The day before I left, on 12 November, I met President Frei of Chile in Sydney. Of course, President Kim Young Sam of Korea visited Australia immediately after the Bogor meeting. APEC was, of course, a central element in all these discussions. But they also enabled me to cover some important bilateral issues. Dr Mahathir and I were able to agree, for example, on the need to improve exchanges between Malaysia and Australia in the area of science and technology. President Frei and I agreed to encourage Chilean and Australian business people to use each country as a base for expanding business in South America and Asia respectively. I was able to have a very frank and productive discussion with Prime Minister Chuan about Cambodia and Thai-Australian relations. My own experience was replicated by the other leaders. The easy opportunity to hold high-level discussions like these gives APEC leaders' meetings a value additional to APEC's economic agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The informal leaders' meeting was hosted by President Soeharto on 15 November in Bogor. I want to pay tribute, Mr Speaker, to President Soeharto's chairing of APEC during the year and at the Bogor meeting. A consensus of the 18 APEC economies on these very large issues was an extraordinary achievement. It required great leadership and vision, and President Soeharto provided that. We would not have achieved this outcome without him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As was the case in Seattle last year, the Bogor meeting was held without officials present and without a preset agenda. Following consultations between leaders' assistants, President Soeharto had prepared a draft declaration covering our common ambitions for APEC and its economic goals. These subjects formed the focus for much of our discussion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central element in the Bogor Declaration of Common Resolve is a commitment to free trade and investment in the region by 2010 for industrialised economies and 2020 for developing economies. What underpins that commitment is our recognition of the growing interdependence of regional economies and the need to work together if we are to maintain high rates of economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">APEC's commitment to free trade was made in the context of the support of us all for the multilateral trading system and our desire to strengthen it. In other words, Mr Speaker, APEC leaders showed that they were opposed to the establishment of a closed and inward-looking organisation, but wanted whatever we did in APEC to be additional to the GATT agreement; that is, they wanted it to be GATT-plus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We agreed, for example, to accelerate the implementation of our Uruguay Round commitments and to undertake work aimed at deepening and broadening the round's outcome. We called for the successful launching of the World Trade Organisation in January 1995 and for all APEC members to work with non-APEC members to achieve further multilateral trade liberalisation through the WTO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of APEC's major benefits, in fact, is that, by engaging the United States and east Asian economies in a common framework, it helps prevent the spectre of a world divided into three hostile trade blocs in Europe, Asia and the Americas. We agreed to a `standstill' commitment on a best endeavours basis to refrain from increasing measures of protection. We also decided to expand APEC's trade and investment facilitation program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of a proposal I made in Seattle, for example, we have now endorsed non-binding investment principles for the region which we will develop to make investment flows in the region much easier.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trade facilitation program, on which a good deal of progress has already been made, will become even more important to our business people as tariffs in the region come down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ministers have been asked to draw up proposals for APEC arrangements to improve customs procedures, establish common standards and lower administrative barriers to market access. In this area of trade facilitation, APEC economies that are ready to implement a cooperative arrangement may do so, while those that are not yet ready to participate may join at a later date. In Australia's case, for example, we are already discussing with a number of APEC economies, such as Malaysia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand and the United States, the possibility of an agreement under which we would mutually recognise each others' testing and conformance arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bogor declaration also gives further impetus to the dialogue on economic policy, which began with the first meeting of APEC finance ministers earlier this year. In my view, these consultations on economic growth strategies, regional capital flows and other macro-economic issues will become more important for APEC over the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another new approach in the declaration comes in the decision to examine the establishment of a voluntary consultative dispute mediation service, to supplement the World Trade Organisation's dispute settlement mechanism. APEC's informal and non-binding approach offers a useful, non-adversarial way of dealing with regional trade disputes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of APEC's most valuable dimensions is the way it brings together developed economies, newly industrialised economies and developing economies. When APEC talks about trade and economic issues, when it frames its actions, it has to take into account the full complexity of 18 economies all looking for growth and liberalisation, but at different stages of development. As I have said before, this is important because it is the way the global economy is going. Cooperation across different levels of development is the way we will have to address these trade and economic issues in future. That is what made the Bogor agreement remarkable&mdash;it was an agreement reached within the framework for the future. Bogor was not about catching up or rectifying past mistakes. It was visionary in a rare sense and a true sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We agreed at Bogor, for example, that, in addition to our trade liberalisation and trade facilitation agendas, we should expand cooperative activity across the fields of education and training, science and technology, small and medium enterprises, economic infrastructure&mdash;including energy, transportation, telecommunications and tourism&mdash;and sustainable development.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all these areas, in fact, APEC is already building linkages and discovering new areas for cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leaders at Bogor recognised the important contribution made to regional debate by the Eminent Persons Group and the Pacific Business Forum, representing large and small businesses throughout the region. It was decided to ask these two groups to continue in operation to advise us on ways we can step up APEC cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to announce that Australia's participants in these groups&mdash;Mr Neville Wran on the EPG; Mr Philip Brass, Managing Director of Pacific Dunlop; and Mrs Imelda Roche, Managing Director of Nutri-Metics on the Pacific Business Forum&mdash;have accepted my invitation to continue in their positions. All three of them have put enormous effort into the APEC task and I thank them for it. I am confident that their experience and commitment will help us meet the new challenges APEC has set itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the most important new decision to come from the Bogor meeting was on trade liberalisation. The Bogor commitment is precise, wherein the leaders agreed to `complete the achievement of the goal of free and open trade in the Asia Pacific no later than 2020', with industrialised economies achieving the goal no later than 2010. The goal involves a multiple year effort but, as the declaration says, `we will start our concerted liberalisation process from the very date of this statement. We direct our Ministers and officials to immediately begin preparing detailed proposals for implementing our present decisions.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a long way to go before free trade is implemented in APEC. Much detailed work remains to be done before we get an agreed plan of action for our meeting in Osaka next year. No doubt there will be difficult negotiations and hard talk as we chart the way forward. Complex issues will need to be addressed, including modalities, coverage and whether benefits will be extended on a most favoured nation basis. It may be that APEC will need to approach these issues in quite a different way from past trade negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But contrary to the belief of some commentators, I do not think these next steps will be the most difficult part&mdash;perhaps the most complicated, perhaps the most time-consuming, but not the hardest. That part was getting the political commitment to a free trade goal for all APEC economies made by the 18 leaders at Bogor. That was what has given the region the negotiating agenda which will carry us forward, and that, of course, has been done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My views of the Bogor outcome were shared by my colleagues there. As Prime Minister Bolger has said, `The level of commitment from leaders was remarkable . . . it is truly going to change the nature of trade in the world in the next five years.' President Ramos has described the Bogor declaration as `A truly momentous decision . . . a very solid road map that we are all committed to follow'. President Clinton said he was convinced the declaration will be of historic importance. Prime Minister Goh of Singapore said the declaration has `sown the seeds for prosperity in the region'. Like Mr Vincent Siew of Taiwan, Prime Minister Goh has committed his country to the 2010 timetable for free trade for industrialised economies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advantages for Australia and the region of the commitments made in Bogor are very great. Modelling by the Office of National Assessments and the Industry Commission suggests that free trade in APEC would more than triple the national income gains from the Uruguay Round outcome alone to more than $300 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Australia, we estimate that under APEC free trade Australia's real output would rise by 3.8 per cent and real national income by 1.2 per cent. This would include a 27 per cent increase in Australian exports and a 20 per cent projected rise in imports. Once the effects of APEC trade liberalisation have fully flowed through, we can expect a permanent increase in employment of over 200,000 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great advantage for Australia will come from the opening up of the fast-growing APEC markets that already take three-quarters of our exports. It will come, too, from making Australia more attractive to investors from the rest of the world. For Australian business and workers, APEC trade liberalisation is good news because Australia is already so far down the path towards free trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Philip Brass of Pacific Dunlop has said, `For Australia, it is all up-side.' By 2000, a full decade before we are committed to achieve free trade, Australia's average trade-weighted tariff will be just 2.9 per cent. That is, 10 years before we need to be there at free trade, we will already have our average trade weighted tariffs at 2.9 per cent. In 1986-87 they were at 10.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even in industries we have come to think of as highly protected, such as textiles, clothing and footwear and motor vehicles, tariffs will be low by 2000&mdash;only 15 per cent in the case of motor vehicles and between five per cent and 25 per cent for TCF. This is amongst the lowest in the region. Tariffs on passenger motor vehicles range from 100 per cent to 300 per cent in some APEC economies, for example, and non-tariff barriers are common. So a great deal of our adjustment has already happened. Australian industry has already shown it is more than capable of competing in a low tariff environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While average trade weighted tariffs have come down by 44 per cent over the past decade, Australia's exports of manufactures have grown by more than 17 per cent a year in the case of elaborately transformed manufactures. Even in the areas of passenger vehicles and textiles, clothing and footwear, companies like Toyota, which plans to lift exports from Australia from $47 million in 1990 to $600 million by the year 2000, will benefit from lower APEC barriers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said before that APEC gives Australia for the first time a seat at a very large table. But the extent of the benefits we or any of the others will gain, and the extent to which our voice is heard at this table, will depend on each of us: on our recognition of the need for change and improvement; on our ability to use the resources we have effectively and efficiently so far sought to use; on our imagination and creativity. This is a large challenge that lies ahead for all of us in Australia&mdash;for governments, for business, for our unions, for our education and training system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our officials at home and abroad will have to liaise even more closely with industry. Our business people across the board will have to understand the region better. We will have to maintain the pressure for micro-economic reform. To coordinate our response to these challenges, the government has decided to establish an ad hoc APEC committee of cabinet. I will chair the committee, with the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) as deputy chair. Other members will include the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), the Treasurer (Mr Willis), the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins), the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) and the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee). Detailed sectoral consultations will be undertaken by all the relevant industry ministers to make sure we understand industry concerns and industry aspirations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's white paper on employment, Working Nation, provided for TCF and PMV assistance arrangements to be reviewed so decisions can be taken in 1997 on post-2000 arrangements. These reviews will take account of what progress is being made on trade liberalisation in APEC. Through my colleagues Senator Cook and Senator McMullan the industry will be fully involved in these decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">APEC has consistently confounded the sceptics. Just 12 months ago the British journal the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> described suggestions that APEC should aim to form a free trade area as `the stuff as dreams are made on'. In a sense they were right, but not in the way the Eurocentric editorial staff meant. Last year, Australian newspapers were claiming that my ambition for APEC to become an Asia-Pacific community was premature. Yet, this year, without the slightest controversy, the Bogor declaration spoke of our `moving toward a community of Asia-Pacific economies'. Why has APEC continued to go further, faster, than the doubters expected? I think the answer is because it makes sense for all the diverse economies of the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said before that APEC did not have to happen. When the Cold War bindings were removed, the development of a cooperative structure like this was neither predictable nor inevitable. The next generation would probably have forgiven us for failing to see the possibilities&mdash;for letting the opportunity pass because it was `premature' or the `stuff of dreams'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was certainly nothing inevitable about the Bogor declaration. It was an act of will by regional leaders and an act of goodwill. It was the result of imagination and cooperation. Alternative Asia-Pacific futures were possible. We might have seen the growth of a self-confident but inward-looking Asian grouping, building on east Asian trade and investment flows and excluding Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view that would have had the most serious consequences not only for the economic growth of Asia and the Pacific but for the strategic stability of the region. Over time it would inevitably have attenuated the defence and security partnership between the United States and Japan with a broader impact throughout the region. On the other hand, the region might have drifted along as before, buffeted by internal and external frictions, but developing no institutional framework to deal with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that the economic integration of Asia was under way before APEC began and that even in the absence of such a structure it would no doubt have continued. But it would be a very different sort of integration&mdash;more ad hoc, driven by companies working in their narrower interests and less open to Australia and to Australian business. We would have failed to engage the rapidly developing Chinese economy or Indonesia and the other South-East Asian countries in a broader regional framework. A critical opportunity&mdash;and one which is open for only a very short time&mdash;would have been lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Australia, either of these paths would have made for a stultified Australian economy, strategic uncertainty and political isolation. Instead, this government chose the path of shaping the future for ourselves and the region. Australia proposed APEC. We worked with other regional countries like Korea to develop it. And now we have given it new institutional focus and energy by proposing regular meetings of leaders to give it the executive authority that the ministerial level meeting could never have had&mdash;to give it the power to make the sorts of decisions taken at Bogor. I am very proud of what Australia has been able to do. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Simple hard work and earnest intentions will not of themselves deliver these things. The world has changed and we all must change with it.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bogor agreement was a recognition of this fact. It is, of course, no reason to make less of our effort here in Australia. On the contrary, because Bogor has in an unprecedented way taken on the responsibility to provide a better world in the 21st century, the challenges for us are more obvious and immediate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australia in which I grew up was a prosperous and secure place. It was then and it is now an extraordinarily good place to live.

Our success in the world's most dynamic region will also depend on this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bogor does not assure us of prosperity. It does not guarantee the future for the next generation of Australians.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make it clear from the outset that there is much in what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has said today about the potential of the Bogor declaration with which we on this side of the House agree. Through the agenda of regional trade and investment facilitation which it established, the statement of the Asia-Pacific heads of government at Bogor has certainly given renewed momentum in favour of the open system of multilateral trade. It has given the United States, China, Japan and other leading economies of the world a sense of common engagement in the pursuit of a common objective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bogor agreement has set a broad course for trade policy and economic development in the world's most dynamic economic region. The significance of that cannot be underestimated. In 1960 East Asian economies made up four per cent of the world's gross national product. By 1991 that figure had risen to 25 per cent and, by the year 2000, it will probably be 33 per cent. The seven largest East Asian economies hold more than 40 per cent of the world's bank reserves. The average savings rate of East Asian economies is around 30 per cent, compared to around 16 per cent in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a region of such economic dynamism, to come together and agree on long-term goals for trade liberalisation is an achievement of great significance. We, on this side of the House, recognise it as such. It is an achievement which owes much to many people over a long period of time. Proposals and initiatives for greater Asia-Pacific economic cooperation go back 30 years. Malcolm Fraser's government made a series of important breakthroughs, such as the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council and the Fraser-Ohira accord. Bob Hawke conceived the idea of APEC and made it a reality. Of course, at Bogor, the leadership of President Soeharto was a critical ingredient for success, and we congratulate him on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bogor summit had some special regional and international implications. It has led to a greater understanding of the importance of Indonesia in the region. It has consolidated habits of cooperation and consultation between regional leaders. It found important common ground amongst societies with widely varying cultural values and economies at very different levels of development and sophistication. As such, it constituted a vital contribution to ensuring stability, security and economic progress in the region as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Australia, the potential significance of Bogor reaches into many areas. The agreement on a target date for free trade in the region and the trade facilitation objectives which have been identified will help to create jobs and raise living standards in Australia. There are specific benefits for Australia in areas such as infrastructure development cooperation, human resources development, environmental protection and technology growth. Furthermore, the new direction and momentum of APEC gives Australia a clear focal point for its engagement with the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The potential advantages for global trade for the region and for Australia's national interests as a result of the Bogor declaration are very great. We on this side of the House certainly hope that potential will be transformed into realities in all the areas that APEC has now identified&mdash;particularly trade liberalisation, the transparency of administrative systems, standardising and simplifying customs procedures, harmonising standards and easing other non-tariff barriers. What is called for in weighing the significance of Bogor for Australia is a good dose of realism to counteract the hype and overstatement of which the Prime Minister has been guilty more than anyone else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard the Prime Minister quoting the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> magazine in his statement today. In fact, I even heard him quoting the London <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Times</EMPHASIS> yesterday, so he will not mind me, I am sure, quoting the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> back at him. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> quoted one of the more expansive claims which the Prime Minister made after Bogor and it countered it with the response, `Steady on. APEC's goal of free trade is not only distant, it is also short on details.' When all the rhetoric is stripped away, the fact is that the Prime Minister's statements during and after Bogor have left many fundamental questions unanswered. He simply ignored many realities of Australia's current circumstances, which mean that we will not be in a position to maximise our gains as a nation as a result of the Bogor declaration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me refer very briefly to what I see as these key questions and inadequacies. First, the Prime Minister has failed to explain adequately why Australia will benefit in the way he has projected from the opening up of the Asia-Pacific economies. His projections need explanation because Australia's recent record of export trade to those countries is in fact far from impressive. In reality, Australia's exports have been losing market share in almost every APEC country, despite the fact that our total exports are growing significantly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Australian exports to most APEC countries have grown since 1989, virtually all other APEC members have had higher export growth than we have. Between 1991 and 1993 APEC countries increased their total imports in US dollars by 20 per cent, but their imports from Australia rose by only just over 2 1/2 per cent. In US dollars, the trend growth in APEC's imports from Australia is only four per cent a year, and that is the third lowest growth among all APEC countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line of our recent export record in relation to the Asia-Pacific region is this: we have about three per cent of the market; our share is not growing; in some particular markets such as China and Malaysia, we have significantly lost market share; and our export to GDP ratio remains one of the lowest among OECD countries. In an important recent lecture, the emeritus professor in the ANU's research school of Pacific studies, Professor Helen Hughes, pinpointed the reasons for this declining Australian share of regional markets. She identified `weak macro-economic management, labour market inflexibility and high infrastructural charges'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She noted that the extent and pace of micro-economic reform in Australia has been so narrow and so slow that we are less internationally competitive than we were 10 years ago. This modest export performance within our own region and the reasons for it bring me to my second point. Under the policies of the present federal government, Australia will be always held back from reaping the benefits of external changes such as those foreshadowed at Bogor because our internal fundamentals are so inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A freeing up of regional trade calls for policy reforms within Australia, of which Labor has shown itself entirely incapable over the last decade. Under this government there will be no genuine freeing up of the labour market, there will continue to be no genuine national savings strategy, and there will be no genuine attempt to reduce the cost disadvantages of Australian exporters and small businesses in particular. Under Labor the tax burden will rise and our transport and communications infrastructure will continue to be uncompetitive with the world's best, as will our training and education system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The brave new world to which Bogor points demands all these reforms and more, and this government cannot deliver them because its constituent groups and the trade union leadership in particular will not let it. What the Prime Minister should have explained today&mdash;but did not&mdash;is how a country like Australia, with a growing balance of payments problem, with rising taxes, with interest rates among the highest in the world and increasing, with a large foreign debt&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is simply not good enough for the Prime Minister to talk in hyperbole about Bogor. The fact is that Bogor is not a panacea for Australia's underlying economic weaknesses. It is no magic pudding.

Boom and bust is the only style of economic management that this government knows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point I would make is that the Australian government signed the Bogor declaration without any clear idea of whether its trade liberalisation measures would be implemented in a discriminatory or in a non-discriminatory way. We put this question directly to the Prime Minister in the parliament as soon as he returned from Bogor. I asked the Prime Minister a very straightforward question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will all countries, including the European Union, have free access to the Australian market by 2010 or will the free market apply only to APEC countries?</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is one of the matters that will need to be considered in Osaka, Japan in 1995. It has been one of the matters which have already been discussed by the Eminent Persons Group, ministers, APEC ministers and leaders. There are differing opinions about it.</PARA>

But I digress&mdash;and I am enjoying the digression.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an extraordinary state of affairs that the Australian government has no position of principle on this central issue of whether APEC should be a discriminatory or non-discriminatory trading arrangement. For our part, our position is a consistent position and is absolutely clear: we are committed to the principle of non-discrimination, which means that all APEC economies must treat all their partners equally and, conversely, that all APEC's trading partners, both within and outside APEC, must treat us as well as they treat any other trading partner. We are committed to open regionalism and, therefore, maintain that any trade liberalisation benefits stemming from APEC arrangements must also be passed on to non-APEC members on a most favoured nation basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of both regret and concern that the Prime Minister will not give a similar commitment to reducing trade barriers on an MFN basis. This should come as no great surprise. On 26 October, the Prime Minister referred to the debate over whether trade liberalisation benefits stemming from APEC should be administered on an MFN or preferential basis, and he described that debate as naive and immature. It is, in fact, the contrary: it is central to Australia's interests, and it is time the Prime Minister had the courage to state where he stands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, the Prime Minister has failed to clarify other fundamental issues. He has given no concept of how the APEC free trade commitment will be implemented. Does it mean zero tariffs in all Australian industries, including the car industry and textiles, clothing and footwear? Does it provide for sectoral exemptions in particular industries? Does it cover all trade or only trade in goods? Does it mean, for example, that there will be free trade between China, Japan and the United States by 2020? Does it guarantee the end of non-tariff barriers to imports into Japan? Does it mean an end to American agricultural subsidies? How are developed and non-developed countries defined for the purposes of the zero tariff timetable? What happens in the transitional period between 2010 and 2020 when Australia and other developed APEC countries have no tariff or non-tariff barriers and when such barriers are still maintained by the non-developed countries of APEC? Is the timetable binding on all parties? I ask why the Prime Minister said publicly in February 1992:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no concept of a level playing field outside of Australia. Outside of Australia you just cross the low watermark. It's catch as catch can everywhere. They all cheat, they'll muck about, they all play favourites. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be interesting today if the Prime Minister had told us whether he thinks these regional characteristics still prevail. These are all vitally important questions that the Prime Minister has decided to dodge. The generalities of APEC are absolutely fine. Its devil, if there is one, lies in the detail, and on that the Prime Minister has nothing to say. </PARA>

<PARA>What has changed? The government's confusion on these basic issues is plain for all to see. When some of them were put to the Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan, in the aftermath of the Bogor declaration, he said that the APEC deal did not necessarily require zero tariffs in all industries.

Of course it is important for us, but it does not need the Prime Minister to be seeking his place in history by overselling it. The claim, for example, that Bogor will mean $7 billion in extra income each year and about 70,000 jobs is simply a fanciful exaggeration.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In truth, APEC and the Bogor declaration represent a truly historic achievement of which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), this government, the parliament and, indeed, the people of Australia can be truly and fully proud. This is an agreement that, in the broad sweep of history, is perhaps unprecedented. It is very unusual for such a culturally diverse set of nations to agree so quickly to something as significant as this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This agreement has come about because of the Australian Labor Party's leadership, successive governments putting together these arrangements as part of their commitment to the internationalisation of the Australian economy. For the first time in Australian history, through APEC and the Bogor declaration, a government has appreciated that geography has become a very strong asset&mdash;no longer a liability&mdash;for Australia, given our proximity to the tremendous growth region of the Asia-Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his statement, the Prime Minister outlined the potential gains for the Australian economy and the Australian people. I will repeat those benefits. For as long as the agreement stays in place, there is the potential for a real increase in output, 3.8 per cent per annum, and a 1.2 per cent increase in real national income&mdash;a dollar equivalent of $6.8 billion per annum, more than double the projected real income gains for Australia out of the Uruguay Round. Of course, the agreement will provide Australian industry and exporters with unprecedented access to Asian markets where, unfortunately, tariff protection has been a feature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some of the Asian economies, tariffs range between 50 per cent and 60 per cent but, under this APEC agreement and Bogor declaration, they are due for elimination by the year 2020 for developing economies. For instance, Indonesia's and Malaysia's car industries sit behind tariff walls of between 140 per cent and 300 per cent. The tariff reduction policy will also apply to Australia. The government has been committed to a five per cent general tariff and a 15 per cent tariff for the car, textile, clothing and footwear industries, which will come down consistent with the Bogor declaration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefits for Australia come about because our adjustment on industry protection, on the tariff front, is largely complete, especially compared with the other nations of APEC. In terms of output and national income, the benefit for Australia is absolutely substantial. Equated into jobs, the agreement has the potential for 200,000 new jobs in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are just two means by which a small country such as Australia can maintain domestic rivalry without reducing the size and productive capacity of firms. First, it keeps its markets open to international competition. Second, it follows the approach of small export based industrial countries such as Sweden and Switzerland, that is, obtaining economic advantages by developing export strategies in a strong base of industries. Australia, through this agreement and the Bogor declaration, is slotting into the economic powerhouse and growth region of the Asia-Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three of the world's largest 10 economies are part of APEC and the World Bank has estimated that by the year 2020 it will have seven out of the 10 largest economies in the world. By the year 2001 the APEC region is likely to account for about 55 per cent of world trade. Over the next three years 40 per cent of global investment demand is likely to be generated in Asia, and Australia is perfectly placed to take advantage of that growth and those export opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our share of exports going to Asia has increased from 50 per cent five years ago to 60 per cent&mdash;60 per cent of all Australian exports finding their destination in the all important Asian markets, the highest percentage for any OECD nation. Australia is perfectly placed to take advantage of Asian industrialisation by exporting our manufacturing services and high technology industries into Asian markets. Australia is also perfectly placed, using our geography, our proximity, as an asset, to take advantage of the westernisation of Asian consumption habits, particularly in food markets, and I know that will be welcomed right across the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement at Bogor also represents an important transformation of Australia's relations with Asia and indeed confirms a confident place for our nation in the world. Part of the reason for Australia's discovery and settlement was the determination of European nations to establish ports on the Asian trade routes which were generating enormous wealth in the 1700s. Right at the very foundation of European settlement in Australia towards the ends of the 1700s, our proximity to Asia was part of the advantage. Unhappily and gradually thereafter Asia came to be seen more as a threat than an asset for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After Federation the parliament decided to put in place policies for a white Australia to lock out cheap Asian labour, tariff protection to lock out Asian trade and centralised wage fixing arrangements to try to spread the benefits of these policies across the nation. Australia was very much an inward looking nation, frightened of its place in the world and frightened of its proximity to Asia. This government, through its internationalisation of the Australian economy, has turned around those features of Australian heritage and values. Now we have, through Bogor, through APEC, a historic opportunity to turn around our attitudes and relationship with the Asian economies to say they are an asset to Australia's prosperity and our trading future. We are overcoming, for the first time in Australia's history, the tyranny of distance. We are using distance and geography, working in Australia's favour, to take advantage of expanding Asian markets. APEC very much seals the advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to make four points in relation to the agreement. The first of those is that it confirms the internationalisation of the world economy; how nations have taken advantage in the 1980s and 1990s of two liberating forces. The first of those is the end of the barren, ideological Cold War struggle between communism and capitalism. That is now producing a nationalism that is much more enlightened, much more outward looking, breaking down prejudices, and redefining nation states not so much as inward looking and aggressive forces but outward looking, confident and cooperative in the international environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second liberating force has been the development of international capital, communications and travel. Improvements in technology right around the world have liberated nations to overcome the tyranny of distance. Australia, through APEC, finding its proper place in our part of the world, is making best use and taking best advantage of these liberating forces. I am pleased to note that these influences are reflected in the white paper on defence that the government released last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My second point concerns APEC's development as an open regional group. It is important to recognise the challenge for a trade organisation, a trade bloc, that has an open, rather than a closed, focus. Closed groups, such as the European Community and NAFTA, have an in-built disincentive for nations to leave the trade group. They are then discriminated against on exports. However, in an open group such as APEC, no such disincentive exists. It very much relies on goodwill, cooperation and leadership to make sure that the trade group sticks together. The open group can make more substantial progress in trade liberalisation than groups operating under closed trading arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other factors need to be considered, and the government needs to be vigilant about this. These factors include changes of government among our APEC partners and reassessment of their competitive advantages and trade position. Such nations could potentially leave APEC if the group is not able to maintain the sort of goodwill, cooperation and leadership that is required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bogor has made a magnificent start but, because APEC is to be an opening trading group, constraints need to be recognised. We need to be vigilant about making sure that APEC stays together as a trading organisation. The Bogor communique on 15 November reflects this task. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our goal is an ambitious one. But we are determined to demonstrate APEC's leadership in fostering further global trade and investment liberalisation. Our goal entails a multiple year effort. We will start our concerted liberalisation process from the very date of this statement.</PARA>
<PARA>Reflecting on the task of keeping an open trade group together, I agree with the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) who, two days before the Bogor communique, as part of APEC ministerial meeting, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even if we succeed in getting this political commitment (for free trade) . . . we've still got a very long and very difficult negotiating road ahead.</PARA>
<PARA>The commencement of the agreement and the Bogor declaration are most welcome, but the road ahead in terms of negotiation and the cohesion of the trading group is very important. It is crucial for the government to maintain the success and progress that it achieved in Bogor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My third point concerns the economic theory of comparative advantage, which says that nations should specialise in areas of trade where they hold a comparative advantage. In Australia, this narrow interpretation of economic theory and trade development would result in a narrow economic base. Australia would be restricted to some limited manufacturing and services, exports plus agricultural and mining areas. It would not lead to the balanced geographical spread of wealth and regional development that is desirable across a large nation such as ours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not want to send Australia back to being a quarry and farm alone. The APEC declaration requires government policy to set out a very broad development of industry comparative advantage. As a nation, we want to develop our comparative advantages in our natural resources, human skills, management skills, innovation and technology. Australia is ideally placed to become a high wage, high skill economy over the 20-year period of APEC implementation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An ethos of continuous micro-reform is required throughout the Australian economy. This government has achieved more structural and micro-reform of the Australian economy in one decade than in the previous eight decades since Federation. Since 1983 it has shifted policy from a closed and sheltered economy, as left to us by the coalition, to the model of an open and competitive trading nation. This has meant making available the tools by which Australian industry and commerce can compete successfully on world markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, we have removed fixed exchange rates, financial regulation and industry protection as artificial constraints to competitive advantage; we have introduced labour market flexibility through award restructuring, enterprise bargaining and the training wage; we have increased the national commitment to a skilled and competitive work force through education and training; we have established an internationally competitive taxation system; and, most importantly, we have increased economic efficiency across a range of transport, communications and government enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian economy is now 30 per cent more internationally competitive than it was 10 years ago. For the first time in 30 years Australia is enjoying high non-inflationary growth. Just as important has been the growth in manufactured exports. Australia no longer rides the roller-coaster of world commodity prices. Manufactured exports increased by 12.5 per cent per annum between 1982 and 1992&mdash;four times faster than agricultural exports. This government has behind it a substantial set of achievements on the micro-front. The Australian economy is much more internationally competitive than it was 10 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point of APEC and the challenge for the next 20 years, as the Bogor declaration is implemented, is to keep up the pace of change, to keep up our outstanding pace of micro-reform and improvements to Australia's competitiveness that this government has entrenched in public policy over the last 10 years. Reform must proceed not by Australian historical standards but by the standards of our trading partners. If Australia makes a five per cent gain in its competitive advantage, while that may be fine by our historical standards it is not enough if the other APEC nations improve their competitiveness by more than five per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key to this agreement is to tie the opportunities for free trade prosperity to a strategy of continuous micro-reform over the next two decades. This would involve upgrading Australia's educational standards even more than the government has achieved over the last decade; improving our market penetration through better management skills among Australian industry and commercial leaders; improving infrastructure efficiency in transport and communications; and keeping up the reform process in industrial relations by simplifying awards, simplifying processes and entrenching enterprise bargaining in every workplace. Most of all, it means the states around the nation agreeing to competition policy. Surely, if we believe in free trade and competition among the Asia-Pacific economies, we should guarantee free trade and competition in all parts of the Australian economy. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to canvass the issues arising out of the Bogor meetings of APEC and to respond to the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I note in the small print of the Prime Minister's statement that he confirms he had bilateral meetings with both the Prime Minister of New Zealand and the Prime Minister of Thailand&mdash;and well he might. Then I looked for further detail, and of course there was none because at the moment we are involved in a major argument with the Prime Minister of New Zealand. This argument was initiated by the Australian Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) and the Australian Prime Minister when decisions were made against Australia's interest with regard to Air New Zealand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this moment, when we are all saluting at the altar of trade liberalisation&mdash;I support the general direction of the APEC Bogor statement&mdash;we have a situation where our Prime Minister, our emperor, has no clothes. He has taken a decision to push further protection against Air New Zealand&mdash;this has affected Queensland particularly and has been against the interests of Brisbane and the Gold Coast tourist industry&mdash;by preventing Air New Zealand from taking up certain rights which had been in part negotiated which allowed it to either be involved with domestic traffic or have additional freedom rights to Asian traffic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the House that Air New Zealand brings a lot of Asian tourists to this country. Yes, there has to be fairness in the arrangements between Australia and New Zealand and between Qantas and Air New Zealand. Ansett has had the right to fly domestically within New Zealand for some seven years. But when the crunch came our Prime Minister and our Minister for Transport decided to go the protectionist route rather than the trade liberalisation route. So on that particular test, which was only very obliquely referred to in the Prime Minister's statement, the Prime Minister sadly failed this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the Prime Minister of Thailand, after just coming back from the Middle East via some 36 hours in Bangkok, I was interested to learn that our relations certainly took a nosedive as a consequence of comments made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program and then by the Prime Minister in the subsequent sitting week. They placed in jeopardy some very key commercial negotiations, particularly with regard to military equipment. They chose a set of words which did not reflect the reality of the situation on the border between Thailand and Cambodia and which were contrary to some of the briefings that they would presumably have been privy to. Further to that, they gave a gratuitous insult to Thailand&mdash;a key ASEAN country, a key APEC country and a fellow country of Australia which helped commence the Cairns Group, and one with which we now have this degree of problem with our bilateral relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will work through that problem. In Bangkok last week I did all I could to minimise the problem, as did the parliamentary delegation. It does pay in these matters to get down to bilateral contact and the nitty-gritty as often as one can through working visits to Asia because then one learns what people there really think of Australia even in the post-Bogor climate. The Prime Minister has been, to some extent, mesmerised by his own sense of regional importance. I make it clear that he is just one of the many players in these regional events. Rather than elevating his own sense of importance, the Prime Minister would be better off addressing the real issues of APEC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal-National Party coalition is 100 per cent behind APEC. We support APEC as part of a worldwide multilateral trading system and as an opportunity to improve regional linkages. APEC is significant for several reasons: it brings together some of the world's fastest growing economies under one umbrella; it focuses the attention of three of the world's largest economies, Japan, China and the United States, in the Asia-Pacific region; and it is an important building block along the path of opening up further multilateral trade liberalisation upon which Australia can build. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">APEC is an achievement that owes its existence to the foresight of many people, including Sir John Crawford, Dr Saburo Okita, Malcolm Fraser and Bob Hawke. It was Bob Hawke who crystallised the idea in his speech at the Blue House in Seoul, South Korea, some seven years ago. To these must be added President Suharto of Indonesia, whose leadership was important for the success of the Bogor meeting and the previous meetings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The potential of Bogor for Australia extends into many areas, including the transparency of administrative procedures, standardisation of customs processes, harmonisaton of standards and easing of other non-tariff barriers, of which there are still far too many in Asia. To postulate the view espoused by the Prime Minister that at the stroke of a pen Australia's access to regional markets is wide open is indeed misleading and naive. While the Prime Minister fantasises about his place in history, at least the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) has shown some realism, recognising the difficulty of achieving trade liberalisation goals agreed to, and recognising that it would only be accomplished over time and with patience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at exactly what happened in Bogor. Agreement was reached for a timetable for regional trade liberalisation&mdash;a timetable that is not binding. Furthermore, the agreement makes a distinction between `developed' and `underdeveloped' in determining the time by which free and open trade should be in place, but fails to define which countries fit into which category. Where, for instance, will Taiwan and South Korea be allocated?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the meeting did not finalise the exactitude of what is meant by trade liberalisation. Is the objective zero? Has the Prime Minister joined the Captain Zero club, of which he reminded us during the last parliamentary term, or is the figure somewhere between zero and five per cent? I accept his comment that that matter is yet to be finalised and resolved. That is fair enough at this stage in the development of the statement, but we clearly need to clarify exactly what detailed objective in terms of tariff will be laid down. I favour the interpretation&mdash;in my belief the correct interpretation&mdash;as `negligible' in this circumstance, and that would be a tariff that falls between zero and five per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of concern that Malaysia has added an addendum to the declaration stipulating that the date of 2020 is not binding. This creates a dangerous precedent for the forum. Already there are other mutterings about excluding agriculture from APEC's discussions and that too would be a disaster. There was no indication about what form APEC would ultimately take. While `open regionalism' were the buzzwords, the United States has emphasised that any trade concessions would be reciprocal and there would be no free riders. Meanwhile, the Asian APEC constituency has expressed a preference for non-discriminatory free trade and Australia continues to sit on the fence with regard to the follow through of that process within the APEC context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that, rather than telling us all what an unbridled success he was at Bogor, the Prime Minister would have spent some time telling us where, in the aftermath of Bogor, Australia would really be headed. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) pointed out, the Prime Minister, either because he was unwilling or, perhaps more accurately, because he does not know, was unable to answer a question in this House on how the trade liberalisation accord will be implemented by Australia. Instead of answering the question, the Prime Minister delivered one of his defensive diatribes. That certainly did not help the standard of debate or consideration of APEC post-Bogor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are looking for illustrations of uncertainty, a day after the historic Bogor declaration trade minister McMullan acknowledged that the government had not decided how it would implement the APEC accords and then went on to say in the Senate that the APEC deal would necessarily require zero tariffs in the labour intensive textile, clothing and footwear and passenger motor vehicle industries. Nor did he explain how APEC's goal of free trade would be achieved without such reductions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, defensive comments have been made by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), who indicated that the government would not speed up its schedule of tariff cuts by the year 2000. Where does that really leave Australia vis-a-vis the timetable? It can be argued that we are already there, but we are not quite there. There are other adjustments to be made to comply with the 2010 objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should look at the APEC region closely. The cold hard facts are that Australia is losing market share of the Asia APEC market. Since 1985 Australian exports to the Asian APEC countries has declined to a current market share of around 3.2 per cent. Indications are that it will continue to decline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, Asia is growing, yes the economies of those Asian economic tigers present great opportunity but, when we analyse the statistics, Australia is actually losing market share to other competitors. Worse, we are losing market share in countries such as Thailand, Japan, the USA and, whilst it is not part of the APEC region, even the Middle East. This is a deplorable situation. As the late Professor Julius Sumner Miller would have asked, `Why is it so?' This parlous state of affairs is, as Professor Helen Hughes has said, due to weak macro-economic management, labour market inflexibility and high infrastructural charges. In that regard, she is absolutely right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similar views are reflected by the government's own Bureau of Industry Economics. In its recent analysis of Australian industry trends, the BIE makes a point that Australia's medium term trade prospects depend not only on an open multilateral trading system and improved linkages with the rapidly expanding Asia-Pacific region but also continued domestic micro-economic reform. Of course, again last weekend we had another waterfront stoppage. That, along with concerns over Mascot, has meant that Australia's reputation as a reliable supplier has been torn asunder yet again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say those networks which exist to transport trade news and upgradings, advisings and updates with regard to trading circumstance rip around the world every few seconds by virtue of the international fax machine and networks which are now locked in. So every hiccup at Mascot and every hiccup, stoppage and strike on our waterfront is through the Middle East and through the Asian trading countries within minutes, if not hours. If honourable members go there they will meet businessman after businessman who will remind them of their legitimate concerns about Australia's reliability as a trading partner. </PARA>

Indeed, we forced the pace and built on some of the outstanding work done by his coalition colleagues by taking the pain and negotiating the closer economic relations between Australia and New Zealand. We opened up a trading arrangement which the Labor Party did not think of and did not develop but which the National Party, its leader at the time, Doug Anthony, and the coalition drove through against some considerable opposition in the electorate of the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) and others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were bitter meetings about CER with regard to the dairy industry, and yet we had the courage to stay the course and provide a foundation building block with our nearest neighbour to the east, New Zealand. The CER arrangements are now the subject of further discussion, partly in the APEC context, as to how CER might interface with AFTA, the ASEAN Free Trade Area, and that is, I think, very timely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Prime Minister how, in terms of the current economic situation of this country, Australia's real national income will increase by $6.8 billion from APEC when, if we continue to lose market share, the present rate will actually be losing&mdash;not gaining&mdash;from these arrangements. In other words, trade liberalisation is not a guaranteed, one-way cheque for Australia. It will only be so if we are not complacent, if we can compete effectively and if we can gain market share, rather than lose it as is the case at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much more needs to be done to improve our economic fundamentals if business is going to benefit in real terms, not potential terms, from the Bogor declaration of APEC. The government clearly has a long way to go in this regard. I close by quoting Greg Sheridan's reference to the Prime Minister's ludicrous overselling of APEC.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;APEC in 1994 represents a triumph for regional diplomacy and for Australian diplomacy. Australia now has an important place at the table of one of the largest trading blocs on Earth.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very disappointed at the attitude that has just been expressed by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">APEC has implications for Australia's economic future; it has profound implications for our political position in the world; and it has important implications for the long-term security of the nation and, of course, our social and cultural direction beyond the years 2010 and 2020, depending very much on the pieces that we put in place in APEC today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way that Australia will define itself over the next 20 years will be inextricably linked to the developments that are taking place now in the East Asia region under the APEC umbrella. The Bogor declaration represents an agreed timetable for trade liberalisation in the region and, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has indicated, offers unparalleled opportunities for Australia to take advantage of those developments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By any measure, APEC is a remarkable achievement. We see in the East Asia region diverse cultures at different stages in the evolution of their political and legal institutions coming together to form a common bond and a new direction. As the Prime Minister and other speakers have pointed out, it is a remarkable achievement in that it represents a declaration of common goals from nations with differing economic systems and at vastly different stages of development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At one end of the spectrum you have the United States, Japan and Australia&mdash;fairly highly developed nations with high standards of living. At the middle of that spectrum are the ASEAN nations, many of which now have dual economies: a reasonably sophisticated urban economy and a near to subsistence rural economy co-existing within the national boundaries. This presents enormous challenges for improvement in their standards of living over the next 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute in this debate today to former Prime Minister Hawke, who was very much an architect of APEC in its initial stages. Of course, the Bogor declaration represents a personal triumph for the Prime Minister. I listened very intently to the Leader of the National Party of Australia as he tried to denigrate the contribution of the Prime Minister to this particular achievement. The Prime Minister has played a pivotal role in the formation of APEC. He has put the APEC pieces together with consummate political skill in a way that reflects his 2 1/2 decades in this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a toil of patience and endurance, but always with an eye for the breakthrough in the collective attitudes of the nations that we have been dealing with. The task has really been momentous: to forge a collective attitude from the disparate interests, which are now APEC; and to work at the highest level of regional and world leadership&mdash;the intricacies of the personalities that drive the nations in the East Asia region. He has persuaded nations that their long-term interests do, indeed, coincide. </PARA>

He made this comment about the Prime Minister, and I would like to share it with the House today. He said that Keating was the last of the great persuaders.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that the opposition really does not understand the full import of the Bogor declaration. It is a statement of the political will at the highest level of ASEAN governments about the future. It is no use meandering around the playing fields on the outside. You have to get into the main game and you have to get the main players to agree. That is what has occurred with this particular declaration. It is important to understand that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very interested in the comments of the Leader of the National Party about whether the government is adopting a zero tariff proposal. The Labor Party has embarked on a program of tariff reductions that are programmed and compassionate. That is not what the opposition proposed before the last election. Its proposed tariff cuts were not sensible; nor was the opposition's response to our reductions credible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested in the comments that the Leader of the National Party made about Malaysia's supplementary declaration not being binding. Somehow, this meant that APEC was coming apart at the seams already. Goodness knows, he would have to have his head in the sand somewhere in the Middle East&mdash;he tells us he has been there for the last few weeks&mdash;not to understand that the Malaysians are posturing and that they had to do that. It does not mean that the Bogor declaration is coming apart at the seams or that APEC is falling apart already. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In relation to Australia's future trading performance, the Leader of the National Party talked about the weak macro-economic settings. I suppose he was talking about the low inflation rate. I suppose he was talking about high growth, high productivity or low industrial disputation. As we are on the issue of industrial disputation and its effects on Australia's trading performance, he toted out one or two industrial actions in our recent history&mdash;over the last couple of months&mdash;as evidence that Asia is turning its back on Australia yet again. Goodness me, there is not a person in this House or in the Australian community who does not recall the abysmal position and record of the opposition as far as industrial disputation is concerned. If anything over the last 20 years has damaged Australia's trading reputation, it has been the policies of an opposition that could not manage industrial relations. It oversaw the highest industrial disputation this country has ever seen and the greatest damage to Australia's trading performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Above all, the hypocrisy of it all was the Leader of the National Party standing up here in the parliament, talking about the common economic relations in the dairy industry and what a great job the National Party had done to restructure the dairy industry&mdash;to put it on a fine path and get us trading with Asia, New Zealand and wherever else. I first stood for this parliament in 1983-84. I can recall that, at that stage, the National Party was organising dairy farmers in the Western District to oppose the efforts of the Labor government of the day to restructure the dairy industry and position it for the very scenario that we are experiencing today. The National Party stalked the countryside, stirring up opposition to what the government was proposing as far as restructuring this industry was concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I read in the paper the other day that the dairy companies in this nation are, over the next five years, going to invest some $700 million in new plant and equipment to cope with the demands that are expected to be generated, especially from the east Asia region. So let us have no more nonsense from those on the opposite side when they seek to tear down this great achievement and to have a go at the Prime Minister and his role in APEC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be people who will have misgivings about the full implications and importance of APEC and the Bogor declaration. There are always winners and losers in the great economic scheme of things but, importantly, Australia has walked down the road of restructuring its economy and refocusing its attention very much on the East Asia region. We have largely dismantled the tariff wall in a programmed and sensible way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently visited two firms in my electorate, one of which was Hendersons Springs, an automotive components manufacturer. Hendersons Springs was very concerned at the lowering of tariffs and what it might do to the business and what might happen to the automotive components industry, which depends so heavily on the manufacture of automobiles. But this particular company got into the export ring and made a concrete decision to reorient its operations, to pick out a niche in the automotive components manufacturing market and to pursue it. Today, it is a world leader in seating technology. </PARA>

The proprietor, Mr George McKendrick, assures me that that company can take on the world. It is investing heavily in capital equipment and in the skills of the work force. It is confident that it can meet any challenge that the East Asia region might now present. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last speaker, the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor), who I think represents the Geelong area in Victoria, was happy to parrot a speech, presumably half written for him by the Prime Minister's advisers, on how good the Prime Minister is. However, he failed to address one of the significant issues in this matter which concerns the implications of Bogor as it relates to his constituents. He has the Ford Motor Company down his way, and many people work for that company. The implications of the Bogor declaration will be a considerable and further reduction in tariffs as it affects the motor car industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a lot of jobs at stake. With Labor's move to reduce tariffs&mdash;welcome as that may be&mdash;without further reform in the Australian economy to allow these businesses to survive, many Australian jobs will be lost. I think, in fairness to his constituents, it would have been better for the member for Corio to have focused on the implications of Bogor to his constituents rather than trying to sell a propaganda message which, as I say, I suspect basically has been given to him by the Prime Minister's office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The prospect of free trade in the Asia-Pacific region, with its attendant political and cultural implications, is truly a dazzling prospect. But it is the implementation of APEC and the willingness of this government to undertake the kinds of domestic reforms necessary to ensure Australia's full participation that concern the coalition. I am sorry that did not concern the last speaker. These concerns are heightened by the government's inability to deal with more than just one foreign policy issue at a time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bogor meeting was a milestone. It marked the culmination of five years of APEC's development. But it was also the culmination of a 25-year process of discussion and interaction about the shape an economic community in the region could take. The promiscuity with which this government takes credit for developments in the region is fast becoming an international joke. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister's remarks today only affirmed that development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thanks to the recent revelations by the Prime Minister, we are now expected to believe that APEC's birth was parthenogenous. We are now expected to believe that APEC and the concept of APEC leaders' meetings sprang fully formed from the Prime Minister's head whereas, in fact, the notion of an economic community in the region was born in the 1960s. Sir John Crawford, for example, was instrumental in recognising the need for such a regional structure. Over the next quarter century, various models for regional economic cooperation emerged out of this dialogue. They included the Pacific free trade area, the organisation for Pacific trade and development, the Pacific basin cooperation concept and the Pacific economic cooperation conferences, which was a joint initiative by Prime Ministers Ohira and Fraser. The concept was not new to our neighbours either, as the ASEAN countries have entered into a commitment to free trade in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So when former Prime Minister Hawke brought APEC to life in Seoul in January 1989 it was against this background of 20 years of development of the concept by regional statesmen and thinkers and academics. Professor Peter Drysdale was very much influential in this process, and his contribution should be a matter of public record. Dick Woolcott, former secretary to the foreign affairs department, played a critical role in APEC's development as Bob Hawke's special envoy; he ensured that the concept of APEC took root in the region. It would be wise to note that Senator Gareth Evans, foreign minister now and in 1989, was not even aware of the proposal when Bob Hawke announced it in Seoul when looking for a good idea to announce on an overseas trip. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bogor was not only a milestone but also a signpost&mdash;one which pointed the way to free trade in the region. The Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party have already gone over in detail the coalition's reaction to the Bogor declaration. I want to focus on some other ramifications of Bogor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The meeting provided an opportunity for bilateral meetings between regional leaders. The significance for Australia of this opportunity is that this government has systematically neglected important bilateral relationships. It has neglected Australia's relationship with Malaysia. In his statement today, the Prime Minister records proudly that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Mahathir and I were able to agree on the need to improve exchanges between Malaysia and Australia in the area of science and technology.</PARA>
<PARA>The reason why the success of such a meeting was not a foregone conclusion&mdash;as should have been the case&mdash;is that the Prime Minister's personal intervention in this key bilateral relationship has been disastrous. The Prime Minister has rightly given credit to President Suharto's masterful handling of the chairmanship of APEC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's effective handling of the bilateral relationship with Indonesia is in marked contrast with his predecessor's efforts, and I pay the appropriate tribute to him for that. The Prime Minister claims that Bogor marked a new level of maturity in Australia's relations with the region. I therefore ask the government to demonstrate this maturity which implies a dialogue between Australia and its regional partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Foreign minister Alatas has today, for the first time, officially acknowledged that in 1975 five Australian journalists were killed during Indonesia's invasion of East Timor. Mr Alatas is quoted as saying that Indonesia was not `one hundred per cent responsible' for the deaths. The AAP report quotes him as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We admit that the tragedy was very painful, but why should we be held responsible for it?</PARA>
<PARA>Elsewhere in the report, he is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are not trying to shake off our responsibility, but we are not one hundred per cent responsible for what had happened.</PARA>
<PARA>I call on the government to take up this issue with the Indonesian government. I demand that the government ask the Indonesian government at foreign minister level precisely to what degree it was responsible for these murders. The killings took place 19 years ago and the bilateral relationship has prospered and grown since then. The coalition welcomes that development. If the government's rhetoric on the current strength of the bilateral relationship is solidly based, then the relationship should be sufficiently resilient to bear examination of this tragic case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Besides its neglect of bilateral relationships with Malaysia, the Philippines and India, the government's regional rhetoric shows that it fails to understand that developments in APEC, with all their promise, are taking place and must take place in a global context. The Prime Minister's confusion over the significance of trade liberalisation under GATT is, unfortunately, typical of this ignorance. In a speech on 26 October this year the Prime Minister said quite clearly that the government's foreign policy equalled the Asia-Pacific region. The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we do not succeed in the Asia Pacific, then we succeed nowhere.</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition agrees with this proposition, but we add the rider that, if Australia succeeds only in the Asia-Pacific region, it will miss important, even vital, opportunities elsewhere around the world. Last year, the countries of the European Union invested $10 billion in this country&mdash;more than half our overseas capital needs. We do not hear the government talking about that and its implications for foreign policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of other points that are relevant in discussing APEC have not been taken up by previous speakers from the coalition. Firstly, I want to say something about consultation. The success of APEC will be driven by the engine of regional growth. Its success, ultimately, will be built on the efforts of thousands, tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people involved in running the businesses of the region as they take up the opportunities to trade with each other freely and to obtain the mutual benefit from regional economic cooperation and trade. That is why consultation with the business community is important. So I welcome the commitment by the government for consultation, and the recognition by the Prime Minister of the work by Philip Brass and others, and I am pleased it is going to set up a subcommittee of cabinet to maintain the focus on APEC and the work that needs to be done for APEC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But for consultation to be worth while it has to be genuine consultation. I have had some insight now into the way in which the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade operates when it comes to consultation. Sadly, it seems that the department's idea of what consultation means is a completely different idea from that which most of us have. For too many in the department the idea of consultation is that they consult with the business community&mdash;not to hear its concerns and genuinely and constructively respond to its concerns but to hear the business community's worries and then preach to it why it should not be worried. We have had fall off the back of a truck a number of minutes prepared within the department about the nature of consultation, and they are far too dismissive&mdash;in fact, arrogantly dismissive&mdash;of the genuine concerns of Australian business people about the implications of Australia's entering into various treaties and international agreements. This has come to a head already in the Basle convention on hazardous wastes and we will hear more of it when the government sits down in March in Berlin on the climate change convention, which holds out the prospect of another increase in tax, this time under the umbrella&mdash;the excuse, if you like&mdash;of an environmental levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt this government is desperate in its search for a dollar. Labor has been a big spender in the whole time it has been in office. We have seen our economic situation improve in terms of the numbers in the GDP as released recently and the government is now looking at a way in which it can slam the brakes onto the Australian economy. It will do that either by tax increases or spending cuts. It does not have a good record at cutting back on spending because it has been farming out too many dollars to its own special interest groups that keep it in government. So it will be looking for tax increases&mdash;after it promised black and blue in the last election that a vote for Labor would mean lower taxes, not higher taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consultation is very important. I encourage the department to reconsider its general approach to the question of consultation. The business community is going to make APEC work. For that to be effective, rather than arrogantly dismiss the business community's interests and concerns, they ought to be properly factored into account as negotiations continue in the development of APEC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last point I want to make is a more general one. After this government was elected, it proceeded to financial deregulation but never understood that the inevitable consequences of financial deregulation were to build pressures for labour market deregulation. In a sense, so it is with trade liberalisation. As you lower the barriers and allow others to trade more freely with you without barriers and without customs taxes, it puts much greater onus on the government to deliver a more efficient economy so our people can compete rather than just losing their jobs to those able to be more efficient overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia we need to do a lot more if we are to reap the full benefits of APEC in the years ahead. That worries me particularly. In the weeks leading up to APEC and the meeting at Bogor, the Australian government could not even keep a deal it had made with New Zealand to allow New Zealanders to fly their airline in Australia when we had already allowed Ansett to fly around New Zealand. If the government could not even jump that hurdle, how can it claim to be able to jump the hurdles still ahead of it in APEC. I conclude by referring to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS>. The Prime Minister referred to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS>. I thought it put it pretty well. In summing up APEC, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The trend towards more open markets is noticeable in most of the rest of developing Asia. APEC may help to boost the development of trade across the Pacific, but its real role may be to reinforce the process that is already well under way.</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition supports that process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In many ways it is a privilege for members of the parliament to have an opportunity to debate a statement of the kind that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) delivered this afternoon. On 15 November, the day of the Bogor declaration, a statement was cabled back to Australia from the Prime Minister indicating that that declaration had been signed and indicating as well some of the implications of that declaration not only for Australia but for the Asia-Pacific region generally and for the world. Today in the national parliament the Prime Minister has taken the opportunity to make additional observations about the importance of that declaration. The Prime Minister said, in part:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not overstating the case to suggest that the Bogor meeting, and the Declaration of Common Resolve which leaders issued afterwards, has permanently changed the nature of our region and the future of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>That is not overstating the case. I would like to refer to part of an editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper the day after the Bogor declaration. The editorial said, again in part:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bogor Declaration is a historic victory for liberal world trade and regional development in the Asia-Pacific. Its philosophical message to the region&mdash;and to the world&mdash;expresses unequivocal support for even-handed competition and hard work, spurns protectionism, and encourages the leading nations of the fastest-developing region to become more engaged with each other in the interests of lasting peace, stability and economic progress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been agreed, in the outcome of an idea spawned five years ago by Australia, means nothing less than the creation of the world's largest free-trade zone over the first two decades of the 21st century.</PARA>
<PARA>The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper refers to it as `a historic victory'. To a very large extent that reflects many of the comments that were made by other editorials and other leading commentators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason, we realise the importance of this particular statement, this particular debate, this matter, which is now in the process of being considered by the parliament. The remarks that were made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) rather than, I hasten to add, by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), who immediately preceded me in this debate, were petty indeed. At least the member for Flinders had sufficient grace to acknowledge, as he said, that the Bogor meeting was a milestone. Yes, it was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outcome of the Bogor meeting was nothing short of remarkable, by any measure. The Bogor declaration was a remarkable statement of 18 countries, many of which have histories and traditions of pressure, tension and conflict. But, in Jakarta, and in the lead-up to the decision made in Jakarta to sign that declaration, the divisions, tensions and pressures of the past were swept aside. There was a realisation on the part of those people, who together met in Jakarta on that day to give final consideration to the Bogor declaration and to give it their imprimatur, that the Asia-Pacific region is a major region of the world. Its future lies in its role as a region and in the integration, coordination and cooperation between the various countries that make up that region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many respects, I suppose that decision is on a par with many of those other great decisions and great arrangements that have been reached in the past as a result of the world seeking to address particular types of problems and particular future developments with which it has been faced. The Bretton Woods agreement, for example, after the Second World War, with the establishment of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, was a decision of major importance which established institutions of great importance and significance, and of fundamental importance as well to the recovery of the world after the Second World War. More recently, we have had the completion of the Uruguay Round of negotiations under the GATT. We have had a series of decisions there which are of enormous importance to the future integration of world economies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose, to a very large extent, what is taking place throughout the world now is what took place between those six colonies that we now call Australia 94 years ago. At that time, we tore down those barriers between six colonies and established a commonwealth, a new nation. What the world is doing today is tearing down the barriers between countries on a regional basis, and increasingly on a world basis, to ensure that the world community, the world economy, will be able to bring to itself the opportunities for development which the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia did 94 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the National Party referred to the position which the government has adopted as being one of fantasy and unreality. I will refer to a couple of sections of the Bogor declaration, and I will do so because I also heard the comments that were made by the Leader of the Opposition. He attempted to</PARA>
<PARA>belittle the significance of this initiative and the significance of this development. He raised a number of issues which are important and relevant to the development of the process towards the year 2010 and the year 2020. He attempted to denigrate and diminish it. He attempted to suggest that the statement made by the Prime Minister earlier today and the remarks made by the 18 world leaders in Jakarta on the 15th were perhaps of less significance than many had claimed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition has attempted to diminish the extent to which those 18 leaders brought a conscientious and determined position to that consideration. Let us see what they said. In the declaration, they said in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We further agree to announce our commitment to complete the achievement of our goal of free and open trade and investment in Asia Pacific no later than the year 2020.</PARA>
<PARA>They did not refer to some tentative ambition. They chose to express it as their commitment. Does the Leader of the Opposition question the sincerity and the commitment which those 18 leaders brought to their deliberations and to the physical process of signing that declaration? The Bogor declaration continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pace of implementation will take into account the differing levels of economic development among APEC economies, with the industrialised economies achieving the goal of free and open trade and investment no later than the year 2010 and developing economies no later than the year 2020.</PARA>
<PARA>Further in the Bogor declaration, the 18 leaders said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our goal is an ambitious one. But we are determined to demonstrate APEC's leadership in fostering further global trade and investment liberalization. Our goal entails a multiple year effort.</PARA>
<PARA>The next sentence in this part of the statement is particularly significant in relation to some of the petty comments that were made by the Leader of the Opposition. The 18 leaders said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will start our concerted liberalization process from the very date of this statement&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, from 15 November. Following that sentence, they said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We direct our ministers and officials to immediately begin preparing detailed proposals for implementing our present decisions.</PARA>
<PARA>They are not talking about implementing their expressions of intent or making some tentative statement about where the Asia-Pacific region will go but, as they said, `implementing our present decisions'. It is a remarkable achievement. </PARA>

<PARA>Stephen Mills refers to it as an earthquake.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition and his colleague the Leader of the National Party are making these petty, nasty little vindictive comments. We have to depend upon members such as the member for Flinders to at least introduce a little bit of graciousness into the debate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the significant changes that has taken place in Australia relates to a number of those more contemporary issues to which attention has been given.

In 1960-61, 30 per cent of our imports came from the United Kingdom. Today, the figure is about five per cent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last sitting week in this place, I and a number of others participated in a discussion of a matter of public importance dealing with the issue of APEC and the Bogor summit. What did we hear on that occasion? We heard a sermon unto the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) from people like the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan) and others. As I said at the time&mdash;we have heard this from a number of speakers on our side of the House&mdash;the APEC and the Bogor summit are not about Prime Minister Keating; they are not about the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans). Indeed, they are about a lot of people on both sides of the House who have worked for a long period&mdash;this goes back well beyond the life of this Labor government&mdash;both at the diplomatic level and, as the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) pointed out, in academic circles. I wanted to put the attitude of this side of the House into a truer perspective than that portrayed by the honourable member for Charlton. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) said at the outset, we strongly support the outcomes of the Bogor summit. Our concerns lie with the follow-up of those outcomes and how they will be achieved. As the Leader of the Opposition said, we support a lot of those outcomes simply because we hope that those outcomes will generate jobs for Australians, and we should all welcome that. But, at the same time, the Leader of the Opposition made the point, with which I agree entirely, that he hoped&mdash;indeed all of us in this place should hope&mdash;that the potential is translated into some sort of reality. That is where we start to get into arguments about `realism' as against `hype', to use the words of the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) when he said that we should recognise&mdash;and I would assert this&mdash;that the Prime Minister seemingly is still mesmerised by his own importance in this region of the globe. We put that point to the government, but obviously it would not agree. But I think it is seen in the community at large that this is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before talking about Bogor, I will go back and talk a bit about APEC. APEC was established to develop approaches towards the promotion of economic and trade cooperation that will enhance associations amongst its members in ways which do not discriminate against non-APEC members. Its regional cooperation is then to be opened to all other states interested in trade and growth. One major avenue for APEC to achieve these goals is through the pursuit of trade facilitation&mdash;and we have heard a lot about that in the debate today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures are directly relevant to the interests of business in the region, can also deepen the basis for communication and understanding amongst members and are consistent with the concept of open regionalism by developing policies which facilitate trade without discriminating against non-APEC members. Furthermore, the APEC forum gives an opportunity for bilateral and multilateral discussions at both the ministerial and heads of government levels. Quite reasonably, the Prime Minister referred to this in his statement today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's emphasis on APEC therefore reflects directly the growing importance of the Asia-Pacific region in Australia's economic relations. That said, we should not belittle the contribution that other areas of the globe will make in our trade relations. Both the Leader of the National Party and the honourable member for Flinders made that point, particularly in relation to the European Union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Asia-Pacific region is growing at a substantially faster rate than the OECD average. The Asia-Pacific region has a burgeoning middle class. Of a total population of over two million people, it is estimated that the number of people with household incomes of $10,000 will double from 40 million to 80 million from 1988 to the turn of the century. While trade and economic relations in the Asia-Pacific region have been growing rapidly, it is fair to say that a high level of protection is still afforded to trade in the region. This has impeded the progress of regional economic integration and prevented the region from reaching its full economic potential. Furthermore, by encouraging trade liberalisation on a regional basis, APEC can also encourage liberalisation at the global level. For example, the success of the APEC leaders meeting in Seattle last year is considered to have had a positive influence on the outcome of the Uruguay Round at the end of last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has also seen as highly valuable APEC's role in associating the United States in regional economic cooperation. Australia has supported active US involvement in APEC as a way of broadening the context of the relationships between the US and Asia, which continue to be vital for the economic and security interests of both parties. The honourable member for Charlton read some quotes, so I will read him a quote from the other side of the coin in terms of APEC. I refer to an article which was written by Denis Gastin in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> at about the time of the summit and said in part:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But amid the backslapping at Bogor it is not churlish to ask: "Are we getting the most we can out of APEC?"</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One very important question too often ducked by boosters is whether our motivation in putting so many of our cards on this particular table is genuinely strategic or just opportunistic. Is APEC being pursued as an element in a well thought-out global trade strategy, as a surrogate for a trade strategy, as a consolation prize for a quite ordinary Uruguay Round outcome, or merely as a series of events?</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is definitely not the former. A stop-start three-year process to produce a national trade and investment strategy has failed to provide the overall strategic context in which Australia's approach to APEC could be positioned in a balanced way.</PARA>
<PARA>He then said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The much-lauded Uruguay Round agreement, for example, has been substantially devalued expost by the backsliding of parties to the settlement who were only ever marginally committed to the result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if this were not the case, Australia's own ability to benefit is severely curtailed by its failure to complete the micro reforms&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>we have heard a lot about that from this side of the House this afternoon&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">necessary to ensure we are sufficiently competitive to take up the "potential". Trade policy and domestic policy are inextricable, the industry bodies argue, but this point has been skated over in the still incomplete national trade and investment strategy process and has been given scant recognition in the run-up to Bogor.

It proposes that a discriminatory free trade area be rejected, that a non-binding investment code be agreed to, that priority in industries for standards harmonisation be decided, that regular leaders and ministerial meetings be reaffirmed and that a dispute mediation process be planned.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unhappily the recent history of US relations with China and Japan hardly inspires confidence in US policy approaches in Asia, and President Clinton has been seriously weakened by the recent US mid-term election results.</PARA>
<PARA>To be fair, the US Senate has now endorsed the GATT arrangements, and we all should welcome that. At the same time, the opposition, in commenting on the summit's statement and declaration, said that the Bogor meeting will take APEC another step forward but that if Australia is to bind with Asia in trade terms we need to be as competitive as Asia and our infrastructure needs to match best Asian practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We criticised in areas. We have been slow to introduce national trade and investment strategies that will assist our regional competitiveness. There is an increasing trend towards intra-Asia APEC trade, which potentially can render Australia redundant as a regional trading partner, and AFTA, which embraces the six ASEAN states that are also in APEC, is disadvantageous to Australia because of its discriminatory nature. There is no clear consensus on a definition of free trade, with some APEC members talking about trade liberalisation and others talking about aims and so on. The outcomes arrived at in Bogor were hardly founded on widespread unanimity. So, while the coalition is behind free trade, there is still much to be done in fleshing out the concept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We talked a little today about Malaysia. On returning from Bogor, Prime Minister Mahathir, in his usual way, made the point that he feared that the proposed biggest free trade in the world would not be a level playing field.

The honourable member for Charlton was with me in New Zealand last week.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the comment by the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) because it stands in stark contrast to much of the comment that came from the Leader of the Opposition in the debate earlier today. I guess all that demonstrates is what a rabble we have on the other side. Whether they are talking about trade issues or issues of privacy, there is no consistent policy line from them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thankfully, in 20 years time, when this country is deriving the full benefit of the APEC agreement&mdash;which is denied by the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;many of those opposite will be long gone from this House. If we were to believe the Leader of the Opposition today, there will not be very significant long-term economic and social benefits for this country. That was the hidden message in much of what he had to say. The most important thing about the APEC agreement is that it gives us tremendous optimism for the future. It gives this country a long-term economic future which, without the agreement, would certainly be in doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But you cannot get a sensible contribution from the Leader of the Opposition on this question. For Australian business and for Australian growth, this is a very important agreement. It holds the prospects for vastly improved access for Australian business to some of the fastest growing markets in the world. The day-to-day task of doing business and trading into that region will, over time, become far easier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of my own electorate, what this will mean over time for a firm like Golden Circle is vastly improved access for the export of canned fruits into the Asian market. That is repeated right across hundreds of firms in my electorate. In the past few years, we have made very significant gains in our exports into the Asian region. Trade in merchandise exports to APEC grew at more than nine per cent over the last four years, and a large percentage of this is manufactures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">APEC currently takes something like two-thirds of our services exports, and they will all grow. Australia's trade links will grow with the fastest growing region in the world. What this agreement means is wealth creation and jobs, and with that comes a fairer distribution of wealth in our community. What do we get from members of the opposition? We get this constant diet of pessimism. The way they were talking about APEC, I could have sworn that they were talking about their immediate political prospects or were reflecting on the current opinion polls. In such polls, the Leader of the Opposition now has a marvellous satisfaction rating of minus 49! I agree that that constitutes considerable grounds for pessimism, but we cannot find the grounds for that pessimism in any discussion on APEC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with the contribution of many of those opposite today is that they are too pessimistic about our future as a nation. The problem with that pessimism is that they will pass it on to our children. If we listen to the opposition, it is simply too easy to believe that the future holds bleak prospects, that the world is a more violent and polluted place and that there is nothing right about the future of this country, when the contrary is true. If we take all of the political debate out of a discussion about this country's future and look at the underlying fundamentals, we see that the trend in world economics is moving our way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Prime Minister and the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank have said, for the first time in our history we are located in the right position on the globe. APEC means that we can take maximum advantage from that. We are now closer to Asia than Europe and North America. That means we can plug into those opportunities, which is what APEC is all about. We already have a balance of payments surplus&mdash;it will be a growing surplus&mdash;with Asia, the fastest growing region in the world. The lesson from this is that we should reject the pessimism that comes from those opposite. It is a pessimism that flows from the policy and leadership paralysis on the other side. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer. I refer to the September quarter national accounts which showed the economy is growing strongly. How does this growth compare with economic forecasts and with growth in other OECD countries? What implications do these accounts have for future growth of the economy?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4009" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We certainly do have very strong growth, as the questioner mentioned. According to our September quarter national accounts, there has been a growth of 6.4 per cent in GDP over the last year, which is very strong growth indeed. Non-farm growth is 7.3 per cent, which is extremely strong growth for that sector. The reason for the difference between the two is that, because of the drought, the rural sector showed an 18 per cent decline, but that still left us with a stunningly high figure of 6.4 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that, in the last 12 months, the manufacturing sector had growth of 12.2 per cent. So we are seeing very strong growth in the economy overall; and manufacturing, which for decades has been in the doldrums, has now, under this government, become a very strong growth factor in the economy and is growing at 12.2 per cent. We have seen private business investment growing at 22 per cent over the last 12 months and plant and equipment at 29 1/2 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to compare those figures with the sorts of comments that were made by the opposition after the budget. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said in June that `business investment is dead in the water,' `there has been simply no recovery in investment in Australia,' `business investment is being hamstrung' and `clearly business investment is still dragging the chain'. What have we had over the last 12 months? Twenty-nine per cent increase in business investment in plant and equipment and 22 per cent overall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These doomsayers opposite would have the nation believe that we are in diabolical circumstances. They never want to acknowledge that the economy might be doing very well indeed and they never want to look forward to good outcomes. They poured scorn over the 14 1/2 per cent forecast in the budget for business investment&mdash;and at the present time business investment is running at well above that level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also saw four per cent growth of productivity in terms of GDP per hour in the non-farm market sector, which is very strong growth of productivity. That obviously helps our international competitiveness and keeps inflation down. Employment is up by 4.1 per cent over the 12 months to the September quarter. So we have four per cent growth in productivity and 4.1 per cent in employment. Prices are virtually stable according to the implicit price deflator for the gross non-farm product. There was a 0.1 per cent increase in that index in the September quarter and a 1.1 per cent increase for the 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have very strong growth of the economy with very low inflation. Along with that, real household disposable incomes, which is where people's living standards get their boost from, increased by five per cent despite the drought. Allowing for a population increase, that gives us a 3.9 per cent increase in the last 12 months in real household disposable income. So in real terms the people of Australia were substantially better off on average to the tune of about four per cent per household over the last 12 months in disposable income, the cash that they had in their hands to spend. That obviously is a very encouraging factor.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition can eat his heart out over it. Along with that, savings have also improved. The gross savings in the economy increased from 16.7 per cent of GDP a year ago to 18.2 per cent in that quarter&mdash;up by 1.5 per cent of GDP&mdash;whilst investment went up by one per cent. So we reduced the investment saving gap somewhat, and that is certainly moving in the right direction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Altogether, it is clear that the economy is moving in a very encouraging way. There has been strong growth of output, business investment, employment, productivity, real household disposable incomes and saving&mdash;all with low inflation. Is it any wonder that, in the light of that, such a harsh critic of the government as Mr Ian Spicer, Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said this in September 1994 about the national accounts:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Economic statistics just do not get any better than the September quarter national accounts</PARA>
<PARA>They just `do not get any better'. On the basis of all those numbers, one can see what he was talking about with so many fundamentals coming right for us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question also asked me to compare our growth with the growth in other countries and with budget forecasts. Other OECD countries have generally not been growing very strongly&mdash;only Norway has grown faster than us in the last 12 months. Our growth of 6.4 per cent was the second highest growth of all industrialised countries over the last 12 months. That, of course, is something we can be very proud of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is in comparison with the budget forecast&mdash;we said 4 1/2 per cent&mdash;that was lampooned by the opposition as being unachievable. The Leader of the Opposition said that it was absurd to suggest that we could get that kind of growth and that it was based on hope more than real calculation. But the fact is that the economy appears to be growing more than that 4 1/2 per cent, despite the intensification of the drought.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I asked Austel, as the relevant authority, to examine both of the proposals. I intend to table Austel's report to me at the end of this answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austel considered three elements in examining the two proposals. First of all, in telephony, Austel found that both proposals were consistent with the government's policy for interconnection and non-discriminatory access. In the area of broadband services, which covers things such as home shopping, educational applications and business applications, the government is very keen to see a new industry develop in Australia producing these types of interactive services. The government has made it clear for some time that it wants to encourage this industry by having an open access regime on the cable infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, for broadband services, I restated the government's view that there should be open access in the delivery of these broadband services on these cables. This was in accordance with the interim report of the broadband services expert group which reported earlier this year. If we really want to encourage the development of this type of Australian content here at home, we have to make sure that these people can sell their wares to people right across the country. That can happen only if we have an open access regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pay TV is more complex. Austel made it clear to me that there are certain difficulties if there is limited capacity, and you have that limited capacity because there are only approximately 30 to 60 channels available on an analog system delivering pay TV. Even Hilmer, which looks at providing access to essential infrastructure, says that there are difficulties in providing access when all of the capacity is used up. So on pay TV, the government believes that we could encourage a more speedy roll-out if we gave the builders of the cable a chance to earn some revenue from the content as well as the carriage of services on the cable. That is what we did. We allowed a limited period, at least until July 1997, of managed or controlled access to pay TV on these broadband cables. But we emphasise that the Trade Practices Act still applies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since my speech of a couple of weeks ago, there has been some speculation that the Optus Vision proposal first might have been scrapped, and today there has been further speculation that it might have been revived. But one thing is clear; that is, that Optus Vision, in all of its discussions with me, has been seeking two things: first of all, closed access to the cable network indefinitely; and, secondly, monopoly rights or exclusive franchises throughout the country&mdash;neither of which the government or I was prepared to give.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is always interesting to see what views are being put forward by the opposition and what might become policy if it were in charge of making policy decisions on cable. At a time when this government is encouraging more competition in aviation, post and state monopolies, what is the opposition's view in these areas? The opposition's view, expressed by its spokesman on communications, Senator Alston&mdash;this was said the day after I delivered my speech&mdash;is this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regional franchise arrangement has worked well in the United Kingdom and the United States. It could have worked here.</PARA>
<PARA>There we have Senator Alston, the opposition's official spokesman on cable and communications, saying that he would have wanted to sit there with the big map of Australia, drawing the lines on the map and saying, `This part of Australia is to be an exclusive monopoly for Optus. This part of the country is to be an exclusive monopoly for Telecom.' No competitive forces whatsoever. That is the view of the so-called free enterprise party in Australia at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look further, Mr Speaker, other members of the opposition have also put out statements on this issue. The day after the speech we even had a rare statement from the Leader of the Opposition on communications policy. What was his view on the government's policy? He said that it was my decision to allow Telstra News to limit access to its cable TV network for up to five years, despite the fact that Australia is supposed to be moving to a fully deregulated telecommunications environment in July 1997. What is clear is that, in that statement, the Leader of the Opposition was saying that he wanted limited access for a shorter period. So that is the view of the Leader of the Opposition. When I said that it has to remain closed at least until July 1997, he said that was too long; he wanted limited access for a shorter period. But the same day that the Leader of the Opposition was putting out that statement, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of the next day was saying this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opposition spokesman, Senator Alston, said, `The government should have given Optus a longer period of protection from free access.'</PARA>
<PARA>So Senator Alston is arguing for a longer period of limited access on the same day that the Leader of the Opposition is arguing for a shorter period. Is it any wonder that we do not know who really speaks for the opposition on this or other issues?</PARA>

In the light of this embarrassing miscalculation, is the minister aware that to abolish the diesel fuel rebate scheme for mining would do far more economic damage, with the cost of mining increasing by over $600 million a year? Will the minister give an undertaking not to damage our major exporting industry and retain the diesel fuel rebate scheme, or will the government once again tax the mining and farming industries without considering the consequences?</PARA></TALK.START>

In any case, let me assure the House that we have no intention of putting the economy into a slide back to very low growth or recession. The whole of the use of policy in the current circumstances, which are, of course, exceedingly buoyant and beneficial, is to temper that growth to ensure that it is sustainable. The use of policy levers, so far as they are used in the future, will be to that effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure the House that we are not going to go back to anything like what happened in 1989. We have quite different circumstances from those that existed in 1989. We do not have the inflation of 1989 when inflation was running around seven per cent. We have inflation now of around two per cent, so it is a very different situation. We do not have the asset speculation that we had at that time. In fact, there are some signs that the prices of some assets, particularly in the housing sector, are starting to come down. So we are not in circumstances anything like we had in 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those circumstances, I expect that we have very good expectations of being able to temper the growth and being able to pursue a course, aided and abetted by the fact that the world economy is continuing to improve its performance. That will assist us to improve our growth and to do it in a very sustainable way through the improvement of commodity prices and export volumes and so assist us to maintain strong growth without current account problems becoming such as to cause that growth to be severely restricted. That is the kind of outlook that we legitimately have a the present time, and the use of policy will be pursued to that end.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CH4">Mr HOLDING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Human Services and Health. I refer the minister to the massive public concern about the management of the Victorian health system. I note that the Commonwealth provides about $1 billion per year to that system through the Victorian government and directly to the Victorian public. What action has the minister taken to ensure that all Victorians get access to an adequate and appropriate health system? In particular, does she have concern about recent Victorian legislation proposing that those managing nursing homes can operate without employing a single qualified nurse?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4016" SPEAKER="Lawrence The Hon C.M." NAMEID="XS4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="FREMANTLE" MINISTERIAL="HUMAN SERVICES AND HEALTH" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XS4">Dr LAWRENCE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like, I hope, every member of this chamber, I am very well aware of the steady stream of public complaints about the Victorian health system, including from members of this House and the member who asked the question. There has been widespread public concern following significant cuts in the Victorian health system. I think that, when the Victorian government first began the process of improving efficiencies and introducing casemix, there was very much a wait and see attitude by the community and by the health bureaucrats. But what we have seen is increasing concern from the community&mdash;not about the introduction of casemix but about the very significant cuts in funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member is right to draw attention to the fact that this is not the result of reductions of Commonwealth funding. The taxpayers' funds through the Commonwealth have, in fact, been increasing. The Victorian government adopts the extraordinary position of calling on the Commonwealth to increase funding to the Victorian health system at the same time as it is significantly reducing funds from its own sources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to give the member some indication of the extent of that problem, the Medicare agreements required an extra $280 million to be paid into Victorian hospitals. It is correct to say that, in 1994-95, there will be $1.1 billion from the taxpayers through the Commonwealth to the Victorian government. Nationwide, there has been a significant increase but the Victorian government was a particular beneficiary. But at the same time as there have been these significant increases, the Victorian health budget was cut by 15 per cent over the last three years. The Leader of the Opposition appears to find this whole thing amusing. A 15 per cent cut, as the member knows, is starting to produce very significant strains on the system to the extent that, on a daily basis, one of the local newspapers actually carries a column detailing the problems faced by patients in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In Victoria, $200 million has been taken out of the hospital system in two years. Outpatient services, in particular, and accident and emergency services have been placed under enormous pressure. If members opposite are complacent about the fact that there are regular reports of elderly patients, for example, waiting on trolleys in accident and emergency services, then I feel very sorry for them indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Funds for outpatients alone have been cut by $24 million this year and there have been cost shiftings from the state government to the Commonwealth and, ironically, from the state government to the private health sector. The minister concerned is one of the first to cry foul when she believes there is any decline in private health insurance, but is the first to shift costs to the private health insurance industry. It is no wonder the system is fracturing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Commonwealth minister, I feel a deep sense of responsibility to draw this to the attention of the public and to make sure that we can reverse this trend&mdash;if not by directives under the Medicare agreement then certainly by public embarrassment. I think the public deserve to understand that, in Victoria, we have seen a rash of bed closures. It is inevitable that we will have a lower level of services. Over 250 beds have been closed in Victoria: in Monash Medical Centre, 80; in Box Hill Medical Centre, 39; in the Alfred Hospital, 78; in St Vincent's Hospital, 26; and, in the Dandenong hospital, 45.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also seen the rules being changed midstream. We had a bonus pool of funding, which the hospitals all bid for to reduce their waiting lists. What do they find? At the critical moment, it has dried up. The hospitals have already run over budget and they are having to close beds.</PARA>

I am very pleased to indicate to the member that, through the Commonwealth standards, we are able to ensure that nurses will remain part of nursing homes in Victoria, despite the attempt by the Victorian minister responsible apparently to remove that element of care.

At the same time that these funds are being pulled out of the system, Victoria is the most heavily taxed state in the country. Each Victorian is being asked to pay $2,006 for the pleasure of funding a grand prix worth $100 million and $30 million on improving ministers' offices. That $30 million, which could be used in the hospitals, is being spent on upgrading ministers' offices. One hundred million dollars, which could be spent on accidents and emergency, is being used on the Grand Prix. I think it is time that Mr Kennett and his minister returned some of that money where it belongs, to ensuring a decent health system in Victoria. Cut out the circuses; let us have some more of the bread.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QG4">Mr GEAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for his question. I agree with the committee that the child support scheme has changed the attitudes of parents, when they do separate, to the financial support of their children. Currently, 240,000 kids around Australia receive an average of $51 a week. The government set up the child support scheme for the benefit of Australian kids, and it is in that context that we will consider the committee's recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I signal that there are two areas where the government believes the committee is wrong. Firstly, the committee is wrong when it claims that the agency collects only 42 per cent of the debt. This year, the CSA has collected 75 per cent of net liabilities. Since the scheme started in 1988, the CSA has collected 68 per cent of all debt. Despite what the committee says, these figures include all default assessments and they exclude private arrangements. This is clearly the best in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, more than 40 recommendations deal with the child support formula. These will be carefully considered, but the committee's preferred model would leave most custodial parents and their children worse off while giving the greatest benefit to non-custodial parents earning more than $66,000 a year. The government agrees with the committee that a code of conduct for the CSA should be established. In fact, I discussed this matter with the Register of the CSA, Michael Carmody, last week and we have agreed that a charter will be established in consultation with community groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure the committee that the government will give its recommendations thoughtful consideration, although many of the recommendations have been implemented already. These include: 90 per cent of phone calls now answered in three minutes or less and a faster turnaround of correspondence. National guidelines have already been implemented. Over the next six months 150 extra staff will be allocated to tackle arrears, and a national training program has been implemented focusing on client services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I agree with the thrust of the committee's report that the government should keep out of the private lives of separated parents so long as the wellbeing of their children is assured. We agree that the private arrangements should be encouraged, and I am happy to say that this year more than 50 per cent of separated couples are now making private arrangements. We will be making every effort to do what we can to encourage this trend. I must add that at all times it is the children who will be the main focus of our child support arrangements.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can certainly assure you, Mr Speaker, and the honourable member for Capricornia that the government is very pleased with the first forecasts which have been released by the Tourism Forecasting Council. I would have hoped that these forecasts would have been of as much interest to members of the opposition as they are to members of the government, who are very keen to see more jobs and investment created in the Australian tourism industry. In particular, we are very keen to overcome some of the confusion that has been around and about in the tourism industry in the past because of the different forecasts that have been produced for the growth in the numbers of international visitors to Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason, the government is pleased that the Tourism Forecasting Council has today put out its first publication which suggests that it expects 6.3 million international visitors to come to Australia in the year 2000. There are three million today&mdash;that is three times what we had a decade ago&mdash;and the Tourism Forecasting Council is expecting over six million by the year 2000. Most of the growth is expected to continue to come from Asian countries like South Korea, Taiwan and Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are very pleased that the Australian Tourist Commission and the Bureau of Tourism Research have now agreed not to continue issuing their public targets and forecasts, which did produce a bit of confusion in the financial sector in particular. We believe that with the Tourism Forecasting Council taking on the role of producing the one set of figures&mdash;the one reliable set of figures for the whole of the tourism industry&mdash;it will be easier for developers to convince financiers to lend them money to get new projects up and running. We also believe that it will give operators confidence to look at improving and embellishing their particular resorts and projects, knowing that this massive expansion is expected and will be greeted with great confidence by the government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me take this opportunity to inform the honourable member about a number of things he has raised. There was a meeting held on 4 November to plan for what is described, quite accurately by the CAS himself, as the likely loss of controllers to the CAA in the forthcoming years. There is&mdash;I was advised as late as yesterday&mdash;still no manning crisis, despite the best efforts of the member for O'Connor to say that there is. Strategies to accommodate the anticipated resignations have been detailed in a number of various forums.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member has repeated this business about the three-year waiting list. The statement about there being a three-year waiting list before new recruits are fully operational is, I am advised, incorrect. Air traffic control recruits take about 18 months to receive their first effective on-the-job qualification. All controllers, be they CAA or Defence, are supervised in one form or another and steps are being taken to ensure that the proper level of supervision will be available when the number of graduate controllers increases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me also say to the House that, as of the second of this month, the air traffic control specialisation strength is 248 on an establishment of 264&mdash;a manning level of 94 per cent of its normal establishment. The Chief of the Air Staff has personally advised me and Senator Ray that this level is manageable and does not compromise safety. Air traffic control manning, at various and individual bases, can vary in comparison to posted strength for a number of reasons, such as recreation leave, training, job rating and so forth. From time to time, base commanders do adjust the level of air traffic control support to accord with available resources. But I stress, and the air force stresses, that safety is not compromised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the honourable member wants to know further what action is being taken on this matter, the Chief of the Air Staff further advised me yesterday that air traffic controllers are being taken out of general jobs and being put back into their specialisation for the time being. That is, supervisors at the squadron leader rank are being pulled back into the line functions. He is also looking at a number of issues that I have discussed with him, such as lateral recruitment from overseas, bearing in mind that the English, American and Canadian armed forces are downgrading their numbers by far greater percentages and absolute numbers than we are. He is also looking at the increased use and recruitment of reservists in this function and at a number of other options.</PARA>

It indicates very strongly the strong regard with which the government holds the profession. A lot of effort has gone into enhancing the status of nursing and improving nurse education and training, particularly over the last decade. If we look over that time, we see a remarkable change: a transfer from hospital based training and relatively low status for the nursing profession to full tertiary education&mdash;something I am very pleased to see, particularly because it is largely still a female profession and represents a significant advance for a great many women.

It was changed to 2.5 because it was feared that some custodial parents would not be able to get a departure application from the Family Court. With the introduction of the child support review process, that no longer is the case, and the justification for keeping it at 2.5 no longer exists.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no matter of more importance to the people of Australia this Christmas than what is going to happen to interest rates. If they happen to be young home buyers, if they happen to be hanging on to mortgages, if they happen to be in rural parts of Australia where they are paying for equipment, machinery and land or if they happen to be in small business with overdrafts and are worrying about trading conditions, nothing is more important to them or weighs more heavily on their minds than interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interest rates in Australia are already high. They are high by world standards and they are high in real terms. As a result of this government's policy, as a result of the wanton failure of this Treasurer (Mr Willis), those interest rates are going to go spiralling upwards over the course of next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> reports this week, Australia has the highest prime bank interest rates in the industrialised world. It is an incontrovertible fact. It is there in black and white. It has been the case for some time. It is a direct measure of this government's economic policy. Even if you look at the three-month money market, you will find that, again, Australia is right up there at the top, exceeded only by Italy and Sweden in relation to the interest rates that already apply in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes to interest rates, we have seen it all before. We saw the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) do it in 1986. We saw him do it in 1989. We are seeing him do it again in 1994. This is a one-stunt government when it comes to interest rates. Every time there is a little bit of life in the economy, the Prime Minister reaches for the interest rate gun and shoots home buyers, farmers, small business people and those who have to rely on borrowings to run their businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the home variable mortgage rates in 1986 went to 15.5 per cent, the real interest rate was only six per cent. When the Prime Minister took them to 17 per cent in 1989, the real interest rate was between eight and nine per cent. Do you know what the real interest rate in Australia is today? It is already eight per cent. In real terms, it is already higher than it was in 1986. It is almost the same as it was in 1989. In real terms, we are right back where we were during the high interest rate strategy when the current Prime Minister was a failure as Treasurer. It was those interest rates&mdash;the home variable mortgage rates which got to 17 per cent&mdash;that led to the recession we had to have. In real terms, they have already passed the 1986 high point and are approaching the 1989 high point&mdash;the rate which threw Australia into recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Australians wanted some good news for Christmas, they did not get it this morning on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS>. On <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS>, Dr Barry Hughes, one of this government's great economic advisers, made the obvious point that, to see where interest rates are going, you should have a look at the futures market&mdash;people who are making financial decisions by buying and selling on the expectation of what interest rates will be. Dr Barry Hughes said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The futures market has priced in now a rate of about&mdash;a cash rate of about 10 1/2 per cent . . . Four per cent higher than we currently have by about June next year, June 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is four per cent higher by June 1995. What are we up to now? December 1994. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it can be distributed in quite a number of ways, but that's one scenario that could come&mdash;increases in February, increases in March, increases in July, taking us to 10.5 per cent. The tight monetary policy of taking cash to 10 1/2 per cent is pretty well pricing in another recession in 1996-97, if it were to happen.</PARA>
<PARA>It is the same old scenario, the same old failure and the same old abrogation of responsibility that we saw in the 1980s. The government has already predicted a rise of four per cent by June next year&mdash;the same old recession. You only have to listen to the rhetoric. It is the same old rhetoric. I think the poor old Treasurer does it subconsciously. He got up here in question time with beautiful economic numbers, a great conjunction of figures, and used exactly the same language that was used in 1988-89. </PARA>

Every one of those one per cent increases in interest rates means another $80 a month for the struggling home buyer. We have already had rises of three-quarters of a per cent back in August and one per cent in October. How many more are yet to come? We have been warning about this since budget night. We have been saying that, if the government did not attend to its fiscal policy, this is exactly the response it would get. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was no great surprise that this would come out. The Macquarie Bank was warning about it. The OECD has been warning about it. It has been saying that Australia will have the highest interest rates in the industrialised world in 1995. The Governor of the Reserve Bank has been warning about it. Yet this government decided to close its ears and pretend that there was no problem. It was the repeated complacency of this government from the May budget onwards that put Australia in this position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer got up here and ruled out mini-budgets. Don't you recall? When we asked back in September, we were told, `No mini-budget; no need. We've got the tightest fiscal policy in the world. We've got the best deficit reduction strategy in the world.' When the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), Sir Toby Belch over here, came in here one day and was asked about it, he got up and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is not necessarily a direct connection between any particular level of deficit at any point of time and short-term interest rates.</PARA>

When the Prime Minister was asked about this yesterday, he said, `I couldn't preclude a mini-budget. I can't tell you if; I can't tell you when; but I can't tell you I won't.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of a sudden the government is beating up this deficit crisis as from last Wednesday. Do you know why it is beating up a deficit crisis now? Because it needs a justification for its secret tax agenda.

You are slinking around the environmental groups talking about environmental levies, and I am pleased to see that one is ruled out. You are trying to whip up a storm out there and create a climate to attack superannuation. That is what this government is doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as hurting the home buyers and the small business people, this high interest rate strategy has exploded a bomb in the wages system. It was the Prime Minister who stood up when the TWU first announced that it was going to push for a 15 per cent wage claim. He said it was affordable in national economic terms. He fuelled it. If you had been a TWU official, you would have said to yourself, `That's okay. We've got the green light.' No wonder the employees went and stopped the airlines. No wonder they are now threatening the Armaguards. This was the man that fuelled them up to it. It is no good the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) now saying to the employers, `Sue them, stop the strike action and defeat the wage claim.' There is nothing left to sue them with. You have absolutely neutered section 45D. What are the employers supposed to sue them with? What are the legal remedies? How do they exist? Big man Laurie says, `Stand up to them and sue them'&mdash;even though there are no laws and there is no framework&mdash;after they have just been encouraged by the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Reserve Bank Governor made a very interesting statement about these wage claims. On 29 November, he gave a speech to CEDA absolutely indicting government policy. He made this obvious point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Increases in interest rates are intended to restrain the growth in spending, including in particular household spending. To the extent that wage earners try to offset that impact through higher wage claims, this simply means that interest rates would need to rise even further to contain inflation, ultimately undermining the capacity of employers to sustain output and jobs in the process.</PARA>
<PARA>The Governor of the Reserve Bank is saying, `We are putting interest rates up to dampen down inflation. If the ACTU says that it is going to make a wage claim to cope with interest rates, then we are going to put them up further.' This is an interest rate wage claim spiral. The Governor of the Reserve Bank is trying to pour water on the fire and the Prime Minister of the country is trying to pour oil on the fire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The greatest problem that you will have to grapple with is that the Reserve Bank Governor is essentially saying to one of his own board members, Bill Kelty, that you, by encouraging these wage claims, are defeating the board's purpose in lifting interest rates. You have a member of the Reserve Bank board saying, `We're going to make wage claims on the basis of interest rates,' and the governor saying, `We're going to put interest rates up on the back of wage claims.' You have the governor and a member of the board at odds over serious economic policy. One has to go. If you put somebody on a board as an adviser then that person is part of the corporate decision making process. Where does their interest lie? It is something that you have never addressed. You cannot address it, of course, because Kelty has such a hold over this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where do the farmers go to get compensation for interest rate rises? It is alright if you happen to be a member of a trade union because you make a wage claim. Where does the farmer go? Who does the farmer put his wage claim on? Where does the farmer go to make a wage claim to get compensation for these interest rate rises? The farmer is just locked out. Where does the small businessman go?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You say that they can get interest subsidies for interest rate rises under the rural adjustment scheme, but the fact of the matter is that, out of 120,000 farmers in Australia, 117,000 of them cannot get the subsidies. There is no provision for the balance. They just have to wear it, do they? You turn around and give $164 million in a drought relief package and with two increases in official interest rates you have taken $300 million back from the farming sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is more to come. It is not just that you are now running this high interest rate policy and punishing the people that are locked out, like the farmers, small business people and those who cannot make TWU type wage claims, but you are now making them pay more in interest rates and you have a plan to tax them so they have less to pay them with. That is the ultimate upshot. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;`That is the problem,' says someone from the opposition. Those opposite obviously do not want high growth. They think it is a bad thing to get substantial growth, to get jobs going and to increase living standards. They do not stand for any of that. They certainly never produced any of that when they were in government. When those opposite were in government their performance was absolutely appalling. They had growth of about 37,000 per annum in jobs. That is a miserable performance compared with our 150,000 per annum in jobs growth during our period in office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`The failure of the government's economic strategy' is quite obviously an absurd proposal to put to this parliament when the government is producing what are, fundamentally, very good outcomes. As I explained at question time, not only do we have the highest growth in the Western world but we also have had growth in employment of four per cent over the last 12 months and productivity growth of four per cent in the non-farm market sector, which is, of course, very important for improved international competitiveness and increased living standards. All of that is with business investment growing at 22 per cent overall and at 29 1/2 per cent for plant and equipment. Savings also increased in the last quarter by 1 1/2 per cent of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of that is supposed to lead to some kind of condemnation of the government for the failure of its economic strategy, even though all of that has been happening in the context of inflation of 0.1 per cent on the implicit price deflator for gross non-farm product and 1.1 per cent over the last 12 months in that index. How absurd it is to put to this parliament the proposition that there has been a failure of economic strategy when there are those sorts of outcomes. It is an absolutely absurd proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite obviously do not know the first thing about economics and are simply trying forlornly to beat up some kind of great community concern about the fact that there has been some adjustment of the economic levers to reflect the fact that the growth of the economy needs to be tempered as we move away from recession and low growth to a period of much stronger growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposition of the opposition seems to be that in those circumstances all one needs to do as a government is slash government expenditure and freeze everything else&mdash;that there should not be any increases in income tax or any other taxes and that there should not be any increase in interest rates. It states that you reduce interest rates in a recession but that even when you grow interest rates should remain at recession levels, that there should not be any increase in them because monetary policy basically should remain a frozen instrument.

No government in the world, nor any pretending government in the world, would put forward the kind of proposition that monetary policy basically should not have a role to play in controlling the economy. But that is the proposition coming from the opposition: there should not ever be increases in interest rates. Interest rates are far below the level they were when the coalition was in government last time. Recall that when you went out of office the mortgage interest rate was 12 1/2 per cent. What is it today? It is 9 1/2 per cent to 9.75 per cent. It is a mile less. It is three per cent less than it was when you went out of office.

What an incredible bunch!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite can be basically disregarded as having any idea or understanding as to how to run the Australian economy. No-one with any knowledge of economics could take them seriously. Nobody in the markets does. Nobody in business does. They all regard them as being basically economically illiterate and are saying that they are just a joke in terms of having any pretence of being the alternative government of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is pure, plain, populist politics. That is all it is. It is nothing more than sheer populism. They just say, `Isn't this terrible? You have adjusted an interest rate from some very low level to a slightly higher level.' That is a shocking thing, even though they are at much lower levels than when the coalition was in office. It is the same with taxes. The level of taxes as a proportion of GDP is less than it was when the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was the Treasurer. It was 24 per cent of GDP then; in 1993-94 it was 21.8 per cent. Even though this government has been in office for 10 years, taxes as a proportion of GDP were two per cent of GDP less in 1993-94 than they were in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times we have seen a profusion of tax cuts. It has been raining tax cuts over the last few years. Certainly, there have been some increases, but overwhelmingly you have seen tax cuts. Let us look at what has been happening. We have had the income tax cuts of November last year, which were paid 7 1/2 months early and cost about $3 1/2 billion&mdash;certainly no breach of promises there. The company tax rate was cut to 33c from 39c and you had it at 49c when you were in office. That is costing $1.8 billion this year. We have also had accelerated depreciation, which is costing about half a billion dollars a year; the 150 per cent research and development tax concession, costing another half a billion dollars; the general investment allowance, costing $300 million; the development allowance, which is rising to around $400 million in the next couple of years; and various smaller amounts for pooled development funds, infrastructure borrowings, offshore banking units, regional headquarters and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, you should not forget the tariff cuts. These are substantial tax cuts which are occurring year by year. So far they have amounted to, going from 1987 when they first started, a cost of $3.7 billion this year. That is the cost this year in terms of the tariff cuts and the cost is going up. Next year it will be $4.7 billion and the following year it will be $6 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So tariff cuts are substantial tax cuts which are occurring each year. Of course, those tax cuts are important for consumers. They reduce the price of goods. They are there primarily, of course, for structural adjustment reasons, not simply to cut taxes. But they nevertheless have the effect of reducing taxes and they are in effect virtually abolishing a tax base. That is something which has to be borne in mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That $6 billion has to be set against the measures that were in the 1993 budget&mdash;the various indirect taxes which will raise about $3 billion per annum when they are fully implemented, as they will be by the end of 1995. So you are looking at not even anywhere near replacing the loss of the tax base through the tariff cuts. In terms of taxes, in recent times we have seen a profusion of tax cuts. Even though there have been some increases in that $3 billion, they have been swamped by the tax cuts for tariffs and for business and by the income tax cuts. That has been the picture over recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To suggest that we should therefore, having achieved all that, never move taxes again, whatever else is happening in the economy, is an absurdity.

Here is this great opposition prepared to say, `Well, we are the tough ones. We are going to go out there and propose reductions in expenditure to reduce the deficit.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has decided to see rates come down because the economy is slowing and there is no point in having interest rates higher than we need them to be.

That is why the Government sought in the first place to lift interest rates&mdash;to slow down spending, which was running at twice the productive capacity of the economy in the year up to the end of 1989.</PARA>
<PARA>There we have it. We are going to get a re-run of all of that economic jargon and claptrap that the Prime Minister ran in 1989-1990. The words are exactly the same. The attitudes in the House are the same. Why should people not be fearful of what this government might do? Why has there been a retraction of activity in the housing industry? Why is there uncertainty out there in small business? Small business has gone off the boil in the last couple of months. The Treasurer knows that. The early figures confirm that. And why? Because there is now uncertainty where there was confidence. </PARA>

You are pulling levers again, and that frightens those in the Australian community. That is why they are worried about what sort of Christmas they are going to get. I quote from an interview Paul Keating had with Marius Benson on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">World Today</EMPHASIS> on 17 March:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PAUL KEATING: Well, interest rates in Australia will be higher rather than lower while ever we run a large current account or external deficit&mdash;an external imbalance. And until that external imbalance comes under control, that is, back towards the target levels we've set for it, then Australia will experience a higher level of interest rates to fund that deficit and to moderate demand.</PARA>

What they are doing is setting up all the blocks and putting in place all the images to repeat that process, to pull the levers and bring the economy under control. When the Prime Minister was asked whether he had control over the deficit or the moderation of demand, he stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No. We have control of it, but we've exercised this discipline on the economy to bring our external debt and external accounts back within what we think are appropriate levels.</PARA>
<PARA>I have pages and pages of this stuff. Do you know what that has done to Australia? That has created a situation where the wealthy have got more wealthy and the poor have got more poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the OECD figures in its 1994 world competitive report on income distribution, Australians have one of the largest groups on low incomes and one of the largest groups on high incomes. We have the greatest difference between low income and high income anywhere in the world. The countries that are the closest to us for that disparate income are Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Turkey, Brazil and South Africa. Those are the countries we can be compared to. That is what this government has done with its policies of high interest rates and high taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer tried to mount the argument today that he has been giving away money and that taxation has been reduced. What a load of bunkum! Not a single individual believes that. He should come out with me to the pubs of Blacktown or anywhere in western Sydney and explain to the people around the bar that he is bringing down taxes. They would love to explain to him what has happened to their weekly budget. They would love to explain how they have lost their jobs. They want to know why unemployment is so high. They want to know how they are going to battle to pay off their houses. They want to know why you are demanding more taxation and giving them uncertainty about whether their homes will be subject to capital gains tax, whether there will be more tax on superannuation or whether there will be a change in foreign imputation. You have a grab bag of stuff that you can look at, and you have refused to allay any fears whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer is giving Australians a happy Christmas. You are giving them uncertainty and insecurity. Your government has a record for doing that. You collapsed the Australian economy with a recession that you said we had to have. You sent thousands upon thousands of businesses bankrupt. You put over a million people out of work and made probably 1 1/2 million people underemployed, most of whom are your own constituents. You come in here and parade yourself as the epitome of a caring person, pulling the levers, adjusting the Australian economy gently to meet the needs of Australians. Yet what you are really saying is, `We will commit those people that have just committed themselves to a new home, and those farmers in the middle of a drought and those small businesses seeking to employ others and create wealth, to more expense, more pain and more uncertainty.' That is what you are saying to those people paying taxes&mdash;whether it be personal income tax, superannuation, or a goods and services or consumer tax that you may consider in one form or another. You are committing average Australians to cost rises, reduced income and the prospect that they will be pinched on the one hand by money being taken away in the form of higher interest rates and be incapacitated on the other hand in the form of increased taxation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was interested to hear the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) concentrating his remarks on Christmas. On this side of the House, we certainly know who will be having the unhappiest Christmas in Australia. It is the parliamentary Liberal Party. What a rotten, miserable existence it must be to sit over there, like the backbenchers opposite, conspiring about the leadership, working out how they can drag down the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) yet minimise the embarrassment for their own party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every now and then, when they are not conspiring or trying to rip their leader down, they glance at the financial pages and see the numbers&mdash;6.4 per cent growth, low inflation and increased international competitiveness. Then they try to work out what they have to do. They trump up the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Higgins (Mr Costello), to talk about economic failure, showing that his bark is a lot worse than his bite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that the government's economic strategy is a raging, roaring success. The only failure in this place is the opposition and its leadership. The dream team of the leader and the deputy leader has become a nightmare for the parliamentary Liberal Party. The fresh start has become the oldest joke in the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say one thing about the contribution of the member for Higgins in economic debate: he must have been a great lawyer. He should have stayed there because as an economist he has absolutely no idea, as he reveals in forecast after forecast, interview after interview. This is the fellow who put out a media release on 30 June to say that the government could not possibly sustain its forecast in the budget of a 14.5 per cent increase in business investment. He said that it could not be done and the government's economic strategy was in tatters. He said we had to go back and redraft the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened in the national accounts after the lawyer's forecast about business investment? Business investment is up there growing at 22 per cent. There is no way the government needed to go back to recast the budget on his advice because his advice was totally wrong&mdash;as it is time after time. The Australian people work out the value and capacity of people in these debates. The truth is that this government is fortunate to have a Prime Minister and a Treasurer with 24 years of experience between them in the cabinet, able to make a collective judgment about the economy and the sorts of adjustments and finetuning that need to be made from time to time. Compare that with the inexperience and incompetence of the Leader of the Opposition and his deputy leader. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Higgins has to be absolutely kidding to come into this parliament with this matter of public importance to say that the government's economic strategy is a failure when, for the first time in 30 years, Australia has high non-inflationary growth. This is the first government in 20 years, in the formulation of national economic policy, that has broken the back of stagflation. The curse that rested over Australia and its citizens for 20 years&mdash;stagflation&mdash;has been broken. It is an excellent set of numbers. It is beautiful to see growth at 6.4 per cent and inflation so low. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has to be absolutely kidding to come into this parliament and say that the strategy is wrong when just today we heard the Prime Minister's statement about APEC. Are the deputy leader or the Liberal Party suggesting that the APEC agreement, with its potential for 200,000 new jobs in Australia, a 3.8 per cent increase in output and a 1.2 per cent increase in national income, is a sign of something gone wrong or a sign of failure in government economic strategy? I repeat: the only failure is the opposition and its failed, abysmal, economically illiterate leadership team. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment is falling rapidly in Australia not only according to the gross numbers. The efficiency of the labour market has been dramatically improved by the white paper. The government is doing well on both sides of the labour market. Demand is picking up through those high growth numbers. On the supply side of the labour market the government is getting the adjustments right, it is retraining and reskilling a new generation of Australians to give them their chance to participate in the work force. That is an achievement of historic proportions. It is the first time in 30 years that a government not only has high growth and low inflation but also has got the demand and supply sides of the labour market right. That is a substantial achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also moving forward with the biggest micro-reform agenda in Australia's history. The Hilmer report and national competition policies have put up for grabs, for competition, for benefits of business and consumers, the $8.2 billion in dividends that flow back into government enterprises around the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we are talking about competition policies, and as this matter of public importance makes reference to tax, my friend and colleague  the  member  for McEwen  (Mr Cleeland) has reminded me of the Kennett government. Victoria, courtesy of the Kennett government, is the highest taxed state in Australia. Victorians are paying $2,000 a head&mdash;40 per cent more than other Australians&mdash;under a Liberal Party government. The Liberal Party has always stood for higher taxation. The ALP has stood for getting it down, doing the bullocking work on the outlays to make sure that tax cuts can be sustained time after time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian economy is now 30 per cent more internationally competitive than it was 10 years ago. There is a record amount of manufactured exports, yet the member for Higgins suggests that something has gone wrong. Nothing has gone wrong. The economy is roaring and raging with success, employment and the benefits flowing out of the white paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the member for Higgins is willing to come into the House and say that these economic achievements are failures, what must he think of the Liberal Party and its own predicament at the moment? If he thinks the government has got it wrong on the economy, what must he think about the Liberal Party and its five consecutive election losses and what must he think of his colleague whom he is propping up until Christmas&mdash;the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition was born with a silver foot in his mouth and is yet to take it out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition gives the government the best Christmas present and best New Year's Eve party any political organisation in this country could ever hope for. If those on the other side, with their backbench conspiracies&mdash;including the member for Mitchell, who is a known Howard supporter&mdash;have not got the courage to tap him on the shoulder, then someone has to say to the Leader of the Opposition, `You just haven't got it.' It is probably time for his mother or his wife to sit him down and say, `Look, Alexander, we think the world of you and you have tried hard, but you are just not going to make it. You have got a 14 per cent approval rating.' He is Captain 14 per cent. One in three Liberal Party voters in this country say that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) makes a better leader than the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a fortnight's time, there will be the 50 year celebration&mdash;commemoration, more likely&mdash;of the Australian Liberal Party. Poor old Bob Menzies must be rolling in his grave thinking about what has happened to the Liberal Party in the 1990s, with the leader having a 14 per cent approval rating. Every speech made by those in the opposition's leadership team reflects the opposition's problem. Every speech reflects the opposition members' lack of interest in micro-reform, their lack of genuine interest in competition policy, their lack of interest and knowledge on fiscal policy, and their absolute personal, poisonous obsession with the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned earlier how the member for Higgins gets it wrong in saying that the government's economic strategy is at fault. Six months ago he said we could not get business investment of 14 1/2 per cent and it is now up to 22 per cent. What of his deficit reduction plan? In an interview with Laurence Oakes, when asked about cutting expenditure, the member for Higgins responded, `Plainly, we have identified many areas over the years where government funds are being wasted&mdash;you know&mdash;extravagance down at the Lodge.' Is this a serious political party when, in talking about deficit reduction in the 1990s, it says that its answer is petty cash down at the Lodge? That is the focus of the parliamentary Liberal Party 50 years into its history&mdash;the sad case of focusing on petty cash receipts down at the Lodge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party even suggested taking away the dog house of the Prime Minister's dog Reuben which I think, coming from the member for Higgins, proves that the Liberal Party has always been about dog-eat-dog policies. That is evident today in this matter of public importance. No wonder the Liberal Party is talking about bringing back the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson). No wonder it is talking about going back to its shadow Treasurer from five years ago and its leader from five years ago. The Liberal Party is always back to the future; it is always having a look at the next century from way back in the 1950s when it snuggled up around Menzies. The Liberal Party is never in any position&mdash;not in Victoria, not in this parliament, not with the 15 per cent GST that, in its heart of hearts, it still believes is the right thing for Australia&mdash;and never has any right to be talking about taxation policies or deficit reduction. The Things that Matter exposes the things the Liberal Party knows nothing about in uncosted spending commitments. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>The government has announced that the sale of the Commonwealth's remaining 75 per cent equity in Qantas Airways Ltd will take place in the first half of 1995. The Qantas Sale Act 1992, which established the legislative and administrative framework for the sale, received royal assent on 21 December 1992 and was subsequently amended in 1993 to extend the date of automatic repeal of any unproclaimed portions of the act until 30 June 1995.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then, there has been a number of developments which require the government's attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Stock Exchange's new electronic share transfer system, the Clearing House Electronic Subregister System, known as CHESS, became operational in September 1994. As a condition of listing on the Stock Exchange, Qantas will be required to be eligible to participate in CHESS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sale act imposes a limit of 35 per cent on the level of foreign ownership and currently provides that Qantas's articles of association must contain certain provisions enforcing that requirement. In particular, the act confers on directors the power to refuse to register a transfer of shares which could result in the foreign ownership limit being breached. Because these powers are inconsistent with the CHESS rules which facilitate unrestricted electronic transfer and settlement in shares, it is proposed that the act no longer require the articles to impose restrictions on the transfer of shares to give effect to the foreign ownership limit. There are currently share disenfranchisement and divestment provisions in Qantas's articles which will continue to fulfil the legislative requirement that Qantas monitor and enforce the foreign ownership restrictions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sale act contains a number of provisions dealing with employee entitlements. Minor amendments will be made to the long service leave provisions to bring them into line with those in other asset sale legislation. The sale act effectively imposes a deadline of 30 June 1995 for completion of the public share offer, as any provisions of the act which have not commenced by this date would lapse. The government has not yet settled on a date for the public share offer, but wishes to leave open the option of conducting it after the conclusion of the May budget. In that event, the sale timetable will be very tight and it may prove difficult to complete all necessary administrative arrangements by 30 June. To ensure that the government has sufficient flexibility with regard to all its options, the bill provides that the legislative sunset clause be extended by two months to 31 August 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Air Navigation Act 1920 imposes controls over foreign shareholdings in Australian international airlines. Because Qantas is subject to its own controls under the sale act, it was not intended that the Air Navigation Act measures should also apply to Qantas. However, as the wording of the Air Navigation Act is ambiguous, it will be amended to confirm that this measure does not apply to Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important piece of legislation to enable this provision to give effect to the sale of Qantas to proceed and, as such, completes the process that needs to be undertaken to ensure that those technical provisions are in place forthwith.

The date has already slipped by two months and that has resulted in this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth recalling the history of the privatisation of Qantas&mdash;quite some saga. It goes back to 1990 when the government decided it would sell 49 per cent of Qantas&mdash;it was not too sure about Australian Airlines. This decision was taken up in the shifts of policy of the Labor Party. The Labor Party is never consistent. It flip-flops all the time: boom-bust, sell Qantas or not sell Qantas, ANL is up for sale or it is not worth two bob&mdash;or now we will sell ANL to the unions and bring in Lindsay Fox and Kelty to help it along. It is a flip-flop game. With Qantas it is exactly the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government did not know what to do, so 49 per cent was up for sale. Then all of a sudden One Nation was produced in 1992 for the benefit of the coming election. In that the government said it was going to open up competition around the place. It said Air New Zealand would come into Australia, we would go over there, we would have this new concept and we would merge Australian Airlines with Qantas. We would have Australian Airlines and Qantas as one airline, both domestic and international, we would allow Ansett to go international and Air New Zealand would be part of the process. That was all fine. There was much cheering for competition policy and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened then? We thought, having put Qantas and Australian Airlines together, that the best idea was to get some money into the deal. After all, Qantas is capital starved; it has high gearing compared with most of the commercial airlines around the world. We sold 25 per cent to British Airways&mdash;at quite a good price, about $600-odd million. To do that, the government in the One Nation paper also reduced the percentage that could be owned by foreigners from 35 per cent to 25 per cent. It sold the lot at that stage to British Airways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time goes by in this magical world of the Labor Party. It is like a magic pudding. The election was won and we addressed the question of the Qantas sale again. What were we going to do about it? We let the procedure go on and called in the task force to see what we could do about selling it, whether management structures were correct and whether the merger with Australian Airlines had really gone well or whether it was one of those things it was still working on. The answer was to find a new chief executive&mdash;James Strong came back to the job&mdash;and to push on with the sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task force called for expressions of interest from financial markets for the underwriting and that was duly set. McIntosh won the underwriting deal. But then came a meeting down here in October this year in which the wise men of Qantas came to town. They let the government know that having Air New Zealand operating in the Australian domestic market from 1 November would have a substantial impact on the profitability of Qantas. Meanwhile the Treasury department was saying, `We need $2 billion out of this to help the budget deficit along.' All of a sudden the cry went up, `What are we going to do?' So what do we do? We welsh on the deal with New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the member for New England (Mr Sinclair) would well recall, a great amount of goodwill was required on a personal basis to make the CER negotiations&mdash;which were started by Doug Anthony more than by anybody else&mdash;work. There was a sweep of the pen in which the transport minister just whipped off a fax. There was no communication; it was just whacked on the machine and sent over. There was no deal on 1 November. The government was mightily upset by this. It was done and justified on the basis that if it did not cancel the deal it would not get $2 billion for Qantas airlines in Australia's stock market environment, which is remarkably poor. Interest rates are rising&mdash;the government's  problem again. The share market is down as a consequence. The $2 billion is looking pretty shaky. So we extend the time for sale by two months in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having done that, the institutions of Australia are now asking the underwriters what the price is on this issue because they want to know what sort of PE ratios and dividend yields are coming out in view of the fact that the government is pushing interest rates up and airline stocks around the world are not the great thing they were a year ago, are not in great demand as they were. There are only two or three really financially sound airlines, and they are Asian airlines. The American airlines and most of the European airlines, except for British Airways, are really carrying a substantial debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next question the institutions ask the underwriters is: what is going to be the capital commitment of the vendor in this particular corporation? That is something yet to be answered. Then they go about saying, `Remember that deal with New Zealand, you know, the one the government sent the fax about and knocked off for the benefit of this float. Can you be sure that after the float is finished it will send another fax and say it is on again now, boys, on the basis that you bought our mate Murdoch's shares out of Ansett. We will fax you back into it again.' It is quite a simple deal. The New South Wales Right do that every day. It is no problem to them. It is right down their alley. In a year's time, Qantas is floated to the public, Murdoch is out of Ansett, Air New Zealand comes into Ansett and the Australian-New Zealand aviation market is once again open&mdash;magic pudding stuff: the flip-flop, where are we going to be tomorrow in government policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the scenario I see coming out of the Qantas game. Anybody who has witnessed it would marvel at the way in which it was on, certain underwriters seemed to have a commitment to have the float, then it was off, then we merged with Australian Airlines, then we opened up all the airline markets around Australia to competition from New Zealand, then we put Qantas back on the float market as a single unit, then we knocked out competition in the Australian market from Air New Zealand, then we found that interest rates, which the government is responsible for, went up and the share market went down. Today we have before us a bill which requires us to extend by two months the time in which the government can effect the sale of Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition will not be opposing the bill, because we support privatisation. But the way in which it has been handled is certainly a lot less than professional and very much in keeping with the general tenor of government management. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to participate in the debate on the Qantas Sale Amendment Bill. The bill makes several amendments to the Qantas Sale Act 1992. Firstly, it enables the sunset clause to be extended by two months to 31 August 1995, thus providing sufficient time to complete the public sale process and all associated activities. Secondly, it gives Qantas access to CHESS, the Australian Stock Exchange's new electronic system for registering share transfers. Thirdly, it allows consistency with other acts relating to asset sales to be achieved in respect of employee long service entitlements. Some minor technical provisions are covered in the remainder of the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Qantas as we know it now, with 25 per cent British Airways investment and a float where up to 35 per cent of the company can be held by foreign shareholders and the remainder of it spread within Australia, does open up the organisation to dominance by a single major shareholder. I have made the point before that you do not need 51 per cent to be the dominant decision maker in the business. British Airways, with 25 per cent, is expected to be the tail, not the dog. I have strong fears that, given the composition of Qantas, given where we are going and given the tough and long established attitude of dirty tricks that has been practised by British Airways in the past, we will have to be extremely careful to ensure that Qantas does not become a British Airways managed operation in this part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not exaggerating when I say that. One only has to look at decisions taken in the United Kingdom over recent years by British Airways in relation to Virgin Airlines. The dirty tricks that were played are not unlike some of the past practices of British Airways in this country. It had a practice of selling tickets on routes on which it was not entitled to carry passengers and, when the time neared for travel, it then claimed that it was the bloody-mindedness of the Australian government that prevented it from being able to carry people on a route on which it did not have a right to carry passengers under the air service agreement between Australia and the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not without some substance that I sound that warning. The Qantas that we know, the Qantas that is now the major domestic and international operator of this nation, must and should remain under the control of Australians and Australian decision makers and not be subject to decision making processes and management decisions of British Airways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last matter the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) raised was in respect of New Zealand air services and the relationship between Australia and New Zealand. We do not want to go through that debate again, but I will respond with just a few words. What happened with New Zealand was a case of take, take, take. There was very little give on the part of New Zealand. In my view, one must always give credit to New Zealanders and New Zealand business people. They try hard. They are sharp, they are alert, and they are initiators. If we give them the opportunity, they will not take an inch; they will take the proverbial mile. That is business. They are clever at doing that. So New Zealand took out those parts of the agreement between Australia and New Zealand that most benefited New Zealand and did little else about the other parts that were involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The additional beyond rights that gave New Zealand some 3,600 extra seats per week out of the Australia were an enormous benefit to New Zealand. There was no corresponding benefit coming to Australia. Without going over that debate again, Australia acted because it had to act. A joint statement was then issued by the New Zealand Minister for Transport and the Australian Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), following their meeting on 10 November. That settled that issue and provided for further progress to be made in respect of Australia and New Zealand air rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will turn now to the international airline industry itself. That is what this is really all about&mdash;where the industry is going; what the prospects are in the industry; who the major players are; what kind of market Qantas is going to be working in in its new and expanded role as a publicly owned business with up to a 35 per cent foreign holding. It is an extremely competitive market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst we think of Qantas in the international field as being a major player, the reality is that when we look at Asia, with a dimension of billions of seat miles, Cathay Pacific provides some 10.5 billion seat miles per annum. Singapore Airlines provides 10.4 billion seat miles, so they are about par. JAL is not far behind, with 10.3 billion seat miles. Then Thai Airways has 9.6 billion seat miles. We come across to trade between US and Asia. That was headed up by United Airlines with 21.5 billion seat miles; Northwest Airlines with 21.1 billion; JAL with 16.7 billion; Korean Air with 8.3 billion; Qantas with 7.1 billion; and Singapore Airlines with 5.7 billion seat miles. So Qantas ranks well down in terms of size and the provision of passenger capacity within that market. We tend to think that, because Qantas is Australian, we are the biggest and the best. We are operating in an extremely tough business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one thing I see flowing out of the amalgamation between Australian Airlines and Qantas is a greater propensity for both Ansett and the new Qantas, operating domestically, to participate in market competition. There was an expectation in some quarters that, once the two major airlines had dispensed with Compass Airlines, they would drift back into the old habits; into that comfortable, cosier position of sharing out the market. I think it is very good that that has not happened. The heavy discounting of air fares during January-February 1995 is an excellent example of how, by freeing up the system and having dispensed with the two airlines agreement, the domestic market can take on an extra 500 million people who will be more likely to be able to afford to travel at those heavily discounted fares in January-February 1995 than under the old system, when they would not have had access because they would not have been able to afford to travel by air. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning back to the international scene&mdash;to Asia, again&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> of 21 May 1994 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While their rivals in America and Europe have been losing billions of dollars, Asia's airlines have so far cruised through the biggest-ever global downturn in their industry. However, behind the well-practised smiles of their famously charming cabin crew, cracks have begun to appear.</PARA>
<PARA>The article then refers to Singapore Airlines, which has long been regarded as a flying money machine. It announced a 5.8 per cent drop in net profits, which is equivalent to 801 million Singaporean dollars in the year to 31 March. That happened despite a 10 per cent increase in sales to 6.2 billion Singaporean dollars. On the one hand, passenger traffic is up, revenue is up by 10 per cent, but the net profit is down by some 5.8 per cent. That is indicative of what has been happening with the Asian airlines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Asia is the great growth market. Everybody who can fly an aeroplane is heading to Asia, like bees to the honey pot. But the competition and the intensity of marketing in that area is making it more and more difficult. It reflects, in a way, what we have had to do with Qantas. As time passes, and as the world market grows, there is a need for fewer but larger international airline businesses. Long established airlines are having to consolidate into larger groupings&mdash;hence the linkage between British Airways and Qantas. Asia's leading carrier, Cathay Pacific, saw its net profit go down by 24 per cent in the year to 31 December 1993. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> also states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Elsewhere in the region the gloom is even more evident. Malaysia Airlines might stay out of the red this year by selling aircraft; Philippine Airlines estimates that its losses last year reached . . . ($10.4m); and Japan Airlines (JAL) desperately hopes it might break even this year after two years of losses.</PARA>
<PARA>The question arises: what has gone wrong, given that air travel is soaring in Asia? The reality is that the Asian airlines are feeling the turbulence from other markets. We have had a heavy overcapacity, and a heavy downturn that occurred when the Gulf War began. International air travel dropped. That was then followed by the international recession and now we are probably just starting to see some sort of change from that. What the Asian airlines have been facing is the result of the impact on other international carriers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing is happening within those Asian airlines that is internal. First, the fleets operated by the international airlines are changing. They are going to larger aircraft, more and more 747s, and the nature of the market is changing. Where airlines could once rest easy on getting their passenger yield from first class travel and filling up the back of the aircraft with excursion-type fares, concessional fares or promotional fares, the income composition of those airlines is now changing. So there is a greater reliance on economy class passengers. That means a rejigging of how they go about their marketing process and the strategy that they follow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other decision is of interest here to Australia. At least a dozen of the Asia-Pacific's top 20 airlines have recently changed hands&mdash;and when I say recently I am talking about just back in August of this year. Everybody assumes that being in the airline business is lucrative. That is not always the case. Some make money; some do not. There is a great deal of speculation that Cathay Pacific might be sold off to Chinese interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, a change has now occurred in the airline business. Whereas in the past we had so many international airlines operating as flag bearers for nations, each nation having to have its own airline to show its flag around the world, finally an economic and commercial realisation has come about that airlines are a transport business, that they should be earning a return and making a profit, and that they are not just there to show their nations' flags around the world. As that realisation has developed, things have become tougher for the airlines themselves; they are having to produce results they have never had to produce in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having looked at that, we then come to the draft decision by the Trade Practices Commission in respect of the agreement between Qantas and British Airways to fix prices, schedules and capacities on the kangaroo route&mdash;that is, on the Australia to Europe route. That has certainly involved changes for Qantas and the expectations it had at that time. Looking at what can happen there, those two airlines can still have other discussions and go through other processes together to try to get some of the economies and joint benefits that come from that. But the draft determination, issued by the Trade Practices Commission on 17 November 1994, denied the authorisation of that agreement. The basis of that draft determination was that there would be a probable lessening of competition for passenger travel, and that the claimed public benefits were limited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That draft determination is a stage in the public process of arriving at a final decision. Qantas and British Airways were to have had a conference on 1 December this year about that. The Trade Practices Commission must hold a conference within 30 days of the expiry of the 14-day period after the draft determination. The Trade Practices Commission has indicated that it will hold that conference a week from today, on 13 December, and issue its decision before Christmas. There are other processes which could be followed through in respect of that decision. But I think there are other means by which the airlines themselves can try to utilise some of the savings and some of the benefits that can come from a closer working relationship, without reducing the public benefits that are available, as was seen by the Trade Practices Commission and which formed the basis of its decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, having spoken of those matters, I want to turn briefly to the Qantas results themselves. Qantas has been through an extremely difficult time. The process of amalgamating a major domestic carrier and a major international carrier, in Australian terms, is an extremely complex and difficult task. There have been industrial relations problems with different unions involved; different unions had coverage of the pilots belonging to each airline. Just this year there was change in administrative and marketing tasks. It certainly has had a substantial effect on the business. But that seems now to have been overcome. The result, announced on 21 September, was an after tax profit of $156.1 million compared with a loss of $376.8 million in 1992-93. However, in that figure there was a loss on abnormal items of $446 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the result in the year concluded, 1993-94, was a good result. It has been a very difficult period to get through. There are other indications, such as a range of key financial operating results that improved strongly in 1993-94. That range includes operating revenue up 13.2 per cent to a record $6.6 billion and earnings before depreciation, rentals, interest and tax up 35.8 per cent to a figure of $865.3 million. I think those financial results are good pointers for the future of the expanded business that will be floated as a result of the legislation that we are amending today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look also at the airline's operating measures for 1993-94, there has been an increase in total revenue from passenger kilometres on international routes of 10 per cent, with those major growth areas being on routes to Asia, New Zealand, Japan and North America. Overall, considerable progress is being made now with the business and the forces behind it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In debating the Qantas Sale Amendment Bill it is interesting to look at the history&mdash;the changes and decisions that have been made along the way&mdash;since the original decision was made in 1990 to sell 100 per cent of Australian Airlines and 49 per cent of Qantas. I will just refer to what this bill actually does.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the bill addresses four issues: firstly, consequential amendments to allow Qantas to participate in the Australian Stock Exchange's new electronic system for registering share transfers; secondly, variation of provisions protecting employees' accrued long service leave entitlement to ensure consistency with other acts relating to asset sales; thirdly, extension of the sale act's sunset clause by two months to 31 August 1995 to provide for the contingency that, because the sale timetable may be very tight, particularly if the sale is conducted after the May 1995 budget, it may not be possible to complete all necessary arrangements by 30 June 1995&mdash;and that particular aspect of the amendment bill raises some interesting questions in itself; and, fourthly, the amendment of the Air Navigation Act 1920 to conform with the controls on foreign shareholdings in Australian international airlines so as not to apply to Qantas, which is subject to its own controls in the Qantas Sale Act. It is interesting to note the reason for the extension of that sunset clause&mdash;and I made a note of this in reading the briefing notes. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major amendment proposed by this Bill is to extend from 30 June 1995 to 31 August the repeal date for provisions of the Principal Act which have not commenced operation.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), in his second reading speech, provided the following rationale:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has not yet settled on a date for the public share offer but wishes to leave open the option of conducting it after the conclusion of the May Budget. In that event, the sale timetable will be very tight and it may prove difficult to complete all necessary administrative arrangements by 30 June. To ensure that the Government has sufficient flexibility with regard to all its options, the Bill provides that the legislative sunset clause be extended by two months to 31 August 1995.</PARA>
<PARA>Since 1990, we have been hearing about the sale of Qantas, the benefits that are going to accrue to the Commonwealth and how those financial benefits are going to be used in all sorts of different measures, but it certainly will not be enough with a deficit reduction campaign. It is now very near the end of 1994, and no doubt we will hear about the benefits again in the May 1995 budget&mdash;certainly in any financial statement that takes place before then. The government is getting pretty good mileage out of the sale of this single asset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the history of Qantas since the decision was made to sell this asset. If we look at the list of major asset sales that have been dealt with by the task force within the Department of Finance, which deals with the disposal of Commonwealth assets, we find that a lot of them have had to go through the process of corporatisation and commercialisation in readiness for sale to the private sector, a part sale of these assets. But Qantas is one that seems to have got stuck along the way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of the sale of Qantas and Australian Airlines goes back to September 1990 when it was announced that 100 per cent of Australian Airlines and 49 per cent of Qantas would be sold. The reason given for the sale was the need for both operators to raise substantial additional capital because of competing fiscal priorities. Details of the arrangements were announced in April 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February 1992, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) delivered the infamous One Nation statement, which contained modifications to aviation policy and the proposed sale. Major changes included allowing all Australian and New Zealand airlines to compete on the trans-Tasman routes and allowing Qantas to operate on domestic flights in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next major change was announced by the Prime Minister on 2 June 1992. The major elements of the announcement were that Qantas would acquire Australian Airlines for $400 million and that 100 per cent of Qantas, and its subsidiary Australian Airlines, would be sold. The sale of Qantas and Australian Airlines was to involve two stages: a trade sale and a public float. It was initially expected that the trade sale would be largely completed by the end of 1992 with the public float occurring in the first half of 1993. That was 18 months ago. We are talking about billions of dollars that could be used to reduce our foreign debt as part of the deficit reduction campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question must be asked not only by members of this parliament but also by the taxpayers of Australia who, in the end, own Qantas. We sit in this place and debate the pros and cons of asset disposal, privatisation, commercialisation and, to a large extent, the assets of the Commonwealth. It cannot be put on the public record too often that the assets of the Commonwealth belong to the people of Australia. They deserve to know what is going on and why the government is changing its mind along the way, why it is doing this and why it is doing that. I do not doubt that the asset sales task force probably has all the best financial interests of the Commonwealth and taxpayers at heart, but there is an element of doubt over the government of the day as to how it uses its policies in this regard as political tools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, Minister Brereton made a decision with Air New Zealand to try to protect Qantas's patch to prop up the sale. As I indicated, it is not going to plan. The public float was supposed to occur in the first half of 1993. We are at the end of 1994 and still waiting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another change in policy occurred in November 1992 when the amount of equity in Qantas that could be held by a single foreigner was reduced from the previously announced 35 per cent to 25 per cent. Subsequently, the date for the trade sale was moved from 30 November 1992 to December 1992. On 4 November 1992, the government introduced the Qantas Sale Bill, which received royal assent in December 1992. Basically, the Qantas Sale Act 1992 provided for the sale of Qantas in three stages. Sections 4 to 6 provided for the minister to declare certain sale days. They are: the substantial minority sale day, the day on which a substantial minority of voting shares in Qantas are acquired by a person or persons other than the Commonwealth; the 50 per cent sale day, the day on which 50 per cent or more of such shares are likewise acquired; and the 100 per cent day, the day on which 100 per cent of such shares are again likewise acquired. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next interesting date in the whole saga of the sale of Qantas is 17 December 1992. The then Minister for Finance announced that cabinet had approved the sale of a 25 per cent stake in Qantas to British Airways for $655 million. In addition to announcing that sale, the minister announced that `the government and British Airways have agreed to a recapitalisation for Qantas of $1.35 billion at the time of settlement' and that `arrangements are proceeding for the float of the remaining 75 per cent of Qantas, which is scheduled to be undertaken before the end of the financial year'. That was in 1992. The end of that financial year has come and gone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 2 July 1993, the then Minister for Finance announced that the government had decided that the float of the remaining 75 per cent of Qantas would be rescheduled from 1993-94 to 1994-95 as it was expected that, with the recovery out of recession gathering pace, a better sale price could be obtained if the sale process was delayed. Thus, the minister said `the government had decided to reschedule the Qantas float on the basis of strong advice from its financial consultants and the chairman of the board of Qantas' and that `advice demonstrated that the government would obtain substantially better value from the float if it were postponed to 1994-95'. That remains to be seen. When we get to August 1995, we will find out what better sale price the Commonwealth gets for the taxpayers of Australia with one of their major assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 2 September 1993, the government introduced the Qantas Sale Amendment Bill. This bill gave legislative effect to the government's 2 July 1993 announcement that the float of the remaining 75 per cent of Qantas would be rescheduled from 1993-94 to 1994-95. The principal amendment extended the repeal date from 31 December 1993 to 30 June 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 4 July 1994, the government announced that the public float of the government's remaining 75 per cent equity in Qantas would take place in the first half of 1995. The rationale given by the minister for the government's decision included that the 1995 timing is likely to maximise proceeds to the Commonwealth and that Qantas is expected to be well positioned to benefit most from a sale at that time. How many times are we going to hear this announcement?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Qantas and government aviation policy affecting Qantas have been the subject of considerable media attention and debate in recent months. The principal areas of attention and debate concerned the government's decision on 8 November 1994 to not proceed further with initiatives directed towards the establishment of a common aviation border around Australia and New Zealand and the granting of additional beyond rights for Air New Zealand international flights operating via Australian ports in particular, and the granting of Australian domestic air service licences to New Zealand airlines. Is this in the spirit of the Hilmer report, the national competition policy? We have two airlines in Australia running domestic services. What the Minister for Transport has done here is just code for protecting those services that are owned by Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second important point relates to the Trade Practices Commission's denial of authorisation to an agreement between Qantas and British Airways to fix prices, schedules and capacities on routes between Australia, Asia and Europe. The third point relates to the establishment of a share ownership scheme for Qantas employees. The point needs to be reiterated that we are forcing a lot of Australian industry and Australian businesses to compete on the world market. Here was an opportunity to generate a bit of competition within that border around Australia and New Zealand as far as air services were concerned, but moi, old Pontius Pilate, decided that there was no way he was going to allow that because it might affect the credibility of Qantas in that sale process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are hearing&mdash;although nothing official&mdash;that all sorts of measures are being implemented in order to eliminate some of the regional services provided by Qantas's subsidiaries in the process. The reason given by some of the regional managers of these air services, after being pressed, is that they are trying to get it streamlined for the public float. So there are some conflicting philosophies that must generate a little bit of concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major amendment proposed by this bill seeks to extend from 30 June 1995 to 31 August 1995 the repeal date for provisions in the principal act which will not have commenced operation. As I said before, the rationale provided by the minister was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government had not yet settled on a date for the public share offer but wishes to leave open the option of conducting it after the conclusion of the May budget. In that event, the sale timetable will be very tight and it may prove difficult to complete all necessary administrative arrangements by 30 June. To ensure that the government has sufficient flexibility with regard to all its options, the bill provides that the legislative sunset clause be extended . . .</PARA>
<PARA>As I have said, we have heard all sorts of nicknames being levelled at the government, but this is just one tactic with a little bit of spin that the government is using for this asset sale. The people of Australia have been hearing about this asset sale involving billions of dollars since 1990. That is four years. For four years we have been hearing the Minister for Finance, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister factor it into all their economic equations. They have said, `We're going to do this and we're going to do that; we're going to sell this and we're going to sell that. That's what we're going to pay for this with.' However, behind the scenes, the government borrowings have been growing. The government is borrowing money to fund a lot of the programs. It is dragging its feet on this asset sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is not opposing this asset sale but, from a personal point of view, the government should be far more genuine in what it is doing. It should get on with the sale of this asset. It should do what a lot of taxpayers of Australia are doing. They are selling a lot of their capital assets in difficult times, as this government is in now, and are using that money to retire debt. Do not use it on a holiday; do not use it to buy a new car. Use it to get rid of some debt; use it to pay off some of the mortgage that our children will have to deal with in the future and pay interest on. We will leave our children a legacy as a result of the actions of this government which this country has been putting up with for the last 10 years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join this debate because, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Elliott) advised us in his second reading speech, the Qantas Sale Amendment Bill deals with a further extension of the time the government now believes it needs to sell Qantas. The parliamentary secretary detailed the number of extensions that have occurred in this program. One cannot help but wonder, in light of the budget that this government brought to the parliament, how we can be asked at a time when the government is well into its financial year to approve a measure in which the government openly admits that it will be $2,000 million short in its revenue estimates. It is not $200; it is not $2,000; it is not even $20,000. It is just a lousy $2 billion&mdash;$2,000 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the forward estimates, this amount is shown as a negative to outlays&mdash;in other words, income&mdash;under the heading `Outlays by functions', which is quite an interesting place to find it. The total of asset sales for 1994-95, as listed in table 6 headed `Outlays by function', is $2,450 million, not all of which was applicable to Qantas. The budget speech made it very clear to us that the government's anticipation of the proceeds of Qantas was about $2 billion&mdash;maybe a bit more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is just an amazing situation. It is further evidence of how badly this economy is being managed.

This is not a game of chess. The reason we are given for the government seeking to further extend this proposal is so that the revenue at best might&mdash;I underline the word `might'&mdash;arrive in the next financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whom the government seeks to blame for this. I was interested to hear how often the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Punch) used the word `advised' in an answer to me today. He did not seem to show much confidence in the advice he was receiving. You, Mr Deputy Speaker Rocher, and I know that when ministers start to use the word `advised' they are not very confident about it. They do not want to come into this House and be told that they have misled it. They hide behind that word. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know where the government stands on this. We know all about the confidence of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the then Treasurer, and the present Treasurer (Mr Willis). We have heard every phrase in the book&mdash;`champagne bubbles coming up', `bringing home the bacon' and all these sorts of references. But the government and the Treasurer should literally be in here apologising to the people of Australia for having so grossly misled them in their budget calculations to the tune of $2 billion. That is the first point I want to make about this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has already been said by our spokesman, the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore), that we are not opposing this bill, for the reason that we think Qantas would eventually be better off in the hands of the private sector. But we really should be opposing this bill on the ground that we demand that the government meet its budget commitments to the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The documents that the government brings in here are the greatest lottery in the world. It gives us all sorts of forward estimates, but it cannot even get the current year right. There is some fairly frightening evidence in its so-called forward estimates, from which I have just cited that figure relating to asset sales. It may be of some interest to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in its 1997-98 estimates the government proposes to spend $10 billion on defence, nearly $11 billion on education and $10 billion on public debt interest. That will rise somewhat if the government does not sell Qantas because it will have to borrow, using your children and my grandchildren as security, another $2 billion. This is an outrageous situation. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SJ4">Mr TUCKEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reality consequently is that a government that wants to make jokes about things like $2 billion is one that seldom gets things right. I cannot remember a budget being brought into this place by the government which has met its predictions. Sometimes they are substantially over, which is a bit of a help, and sometimes they are substantially under. But it never seems to get it right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental issue is that, during the years of which it boasts, the debt of Australians, as accumulated by the government on its behalf, has grown from about $15 billion to $100 billion. That has nothing to do with the international debt; that is straight-out debt. It appears, for the time being at least, that that debt will grow by a further $2 billion because the government admits in this legislation that it has not got around to selling Qantas yet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the speech of the member for Ryan in which he raised grave doubts that the government will get $2 billion in the present share market. The prediction coming from the government's advisers of recent times is that, by the time we get this new date, interest rates could be up another four per cent. The investing public, of course, is not that silly. The member for Ryan warned that we could have a situation where, once the government has put the property on the market, floated it, sold it and declared a substantial profit because of the near monopoly of domestic air transport that still exists in Australia&mdash;which, of course, it has guaranteed by frightening out the only viable competitor, Air New Zealand&mdash;it might then go back and say, `We have to make friends with Air New Zealand.' The spin doctors will again go to work, we will be given reasons why all this has to happen and the poor old mums and dads that have bought Qantas shares will be waiting a long time for a dividend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is outrageous. We are told that the sale has to comply with all the requirements of the Stock Exchange. There is one requirement about honesty down there at the Stock Exchange. The member for Ryan, an expert in this field, could tell you that when you go down to the Stock Exchange with your prospectus you are supposed to make some predictions that are reasonably correct. When one looks at the way these people who are going to put out the prospectus run their budget, if I were a mum and dad investor, I would have to say I would have my doubts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the first point we are dealing with. Then we have the Air New Zealand fiasco which is inextricably linked with this legislation today. What an amazing situation we have! The Prime Minister went off to a meeting with the Premiers and then came back here and castigated them for not being able to get on with the Hilmer report recommendations relating to competition policy. I had a bit of advice about that meeting from someone else who was there. Apparently, the Premiers told the Prime Minister that they wanted to deal with him without officials. From that point on, the Prime Minister was mute. He did not know what he was talking about. The Premiers knew what they were talking about without officials, but the Prime Minister could not handle it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the Prime Minister came back here and castigated the Premiers. He told us how the states and local government have to get on with competition policy. That is an admirable objective. But there is a third party in the federation. It is called the federal government. When is the federal government going to get on with its competition policy? The states have to do something about competition in electricity generation. The poor old local government people are running around wondering how they are going to comply; they are all writing us letters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But when it comes to competition for Qantas the government says, `No, we don't want to do that,' and it kicks Air New Zealand out. When it comes to competition for ANL, `No, we are not allowed to get rid of cabotage.' We could not possibly let the farmers of Western Australia get some grain around to the drought affected farmers of the east coast at anything like a reasonable price. We are stuck with the fact that it is cheaper to freight the grain all the way from North America. In fact, I am told it is half the price. We will probably ship some of the wheat from Western Australia to America because it will be cheaper to send it there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely, if this government were in any way dinkum about competition policy, it would practice a bit of it itself. The government would have the confidence in Qantas to take on the competition of Air New Zealand&mdash;after all, it owns some of Air New Zealand because it is a part shareholder; it should be able to handle that. This raises suspicions about what the government is really up to. I think it was the member for Ryan who said that it seemed to have more to do with putting pressure on Air New Zealand to buy a certain media proprietor out than it had to do with anything else, even protecting Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If competition policy is a plank of this government&mdash;that is the sort thing the public wants to know, what the government is up to and what it really believes in; I think they thought it believed in the l-a-w tax cuts&mdash;it should be leading the way. Consequently, the government should have allowed the competition to proceed with Qantas and then gone to the market for two reasons. Firstly, the public would have had a clear indication of what the Qantas shares would be worth and, secondly, it would have been good government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is good government because of the downstream effect. I have already raised the first downstream effect. We have people suffering in drought affected areas, denied the most economical way of getting help, without any government payout. I commend the government for going out and dealing out a pittance in these drought affected area&mdash;it was something. But for no cost at all to the taxpayer, just by allowing a bit of competition with ANL, the government could have substantially improved the financial affairs of many people trying to keep their breeding stocks alive by allowing them to buy Australian wheat, barley or lupins without the worry of exotic weeds being introduced from other parts of the world. The government could have solved the problem by saying, `We will wipe out cabotage. We will give an example to the states of how to conduct competition policy.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we get to Qantas, there happens to be a little thing in Australia called the tourist industry. The Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) lectures us on how the tourism industry is growing. The tourism industry is totally dependent on the cost of air travel. The government props up Qantas and it starves the tourist industry. That is silly. That is the best way to describe it. The government is propping up Qantas and denying competition by people who sell rooms&mdash;which, by the way, I think it is wanting to tax&mdash;and the people who sell meals and charter trips to the Great Barrier Reef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard it said&mdash;I cannot prove it&mdash;that there is so much ill-feeling in New Zealand that there has been a drop in New Zealand tourism to Australia. If someone produces statistics to prove me wrong, I will accept them. I am not surprised. I think the New Zealanders were treated abominably by that decision at that time. There may have been some aspects of the arrangements or negotiations that had been concluded, but the government could gee them up and give them notice or give them another month. It is back in the parliament saying, `We need a few more months to sell Qantas.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the parliament, on both sides, had any courage at all, it would be saying to this lax administration, `Sorry, you cannot have it.' But that is not the way this place runs. If you get two faction leaders, you have a vote. It is an outrage that this parliament was demeaned to its lowest possible point by the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) today. He is still trying to be Mick Young, and he is not funny. Parliament was demeaned to the lowest level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the Minister for Finance has to put on a tough image because he wants to be the leader when the current leader retires. I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that he looked a lot better when he played his own role. I will bet his father is devastated by the performance he saw today. The minister's father, as honourable members might remember, was the person who said when he joined the Labor Party that it was the cream of the working class and when he left it that it was the dregs of the middle class.

Mick was genuinely funny and could do it without a script, but this fellow cannot. I will concede Mick's skills; he was great. Of course, if I need a reason for mentioning him, he is at Qantas, too. I think he has a pretty good job there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts of life are that this downstream effect on Qantas and the removal of this competition, which has been achieved and is associated with this sale&mdash;the sale is the reason they have had to hunt Air New Zealand out of this place&mdash;simply means that competition in air travel is not at the heights it should be. As a consequence of that, we get a situation where certain people will not take tourist holidays and certain people will not come to Australia. That is a major loss because the tourist industry is a highly profitable industry for Australia. It delivers that overseas income that we so desperately need to overcome the current account deficit, which is another part of the budget prediction that has blown out. Nobody seems to care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all of that, I am reminded of the words of an economist speaking on behalf of CRA on the ABC today. He said something that I have repeated time and time again. It is in the context of the $2 billion not coming to hand in this budget. The simple fact is that children are going to have to carry the debt for the extravagance of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This economist made the other point I frequently make that overseas debt is frequently the problem of the private sector. It is only because of this government's consistent borrowing in the domestic markets that there is nothing left for the private sector to borrow. It therefore carries the responsibility. Anyway, if our net debt is now $170 billion, this government owes $100 billion of it. That is going to be aggravated by another $2 billion in this legislation; by the government's own admission, it cannot meet this income target on time. The government is blaming the Stock Exchange for changing some computer program, but that has probably been on the drawing board for four years. You do not put in a computer program of this nature with a click of your fingers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an outrage, and it is wrong. In fact, notwithstanding that we are supporting the legislation, this parliament should be saying to the government that it is totally unacceptable that it can rewrite its budget to the tune of $2 billion by coming in here with a couple of pages of legislation. I believe the government ought to be criticised for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is really a serious matter. I would have liked to have had a bit more time to talk about the debt effects. I think it is laughable that a government can lecture people in state governments about competition policy when it refuses to accept it in terms of its own operations in Qantas and ANL. The downstream effect that is having on other viable sectors of our economy is just unbelievable and it makes a joke of people who stand up and want to talk about competition when the government itself is not being competitive. Just think of the effects of the carbon tax on competition. It drives people out of Australia to countries that have low energy consumption per capita. It is just silly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to explain why the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues is wrong when it claims that the Child Support Agency's collection rate is only 42 per cent. According to a personal explanation from the committee chairman, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), the misunderstanding is based on confusion about how the CSA reports its collection rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that the CSA told the Auditor-General, as reported in the ANAO report, that there were problems in using default measures at 2 1/2 times average weekly earnings as a measure of debt. The figure assumes that everyone who does not pay child support owes child support based on 2 1/2 times average weekly earnings. This is quite clearly not true. Some payers, for example, are unemployed; they owe nothing. Others earn less than average weekly earnings and their debt will, in fact, be less than this measure estimates. However, the CSA has not yet refined a new method of measuring outstanding debt, and in the meantime the figures I referred to earlier in the House include default assessments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, the CSA informs me that it does not include, and never has included, private payment cases in its collection rates. It informs me that at no time was the committee told that private payment cases were included. That leaves me with my original answer given in the House today: that in the last year the CSA collection rate was 75 per cent of net liabilities and, since 1988, 68 per cent of all debt&mdash;as I said at the time, the best in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the formula changes proposed by the committee, I stand by my claim that those who would benefit the most would be non-custodial parents on the highest incomes&mdash;those earning over $66,000 a year. Nevertheless, I want to reassure the House that the government will give careful and calm consideration to the detailed recommendations of the report.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;In the spirit of  the last remarks of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), which were that the government is looking forward to a calm and detailed consideration of the report, I hope to respond in kind; that is, I welcome that news. If there is some confusion about the collection rate, I can only say that it has been well-intentioned confusion and I believe it has been based on advice that the committee has received, either from the Department of Social Security or from the CSA. Page 15 of the ANAO report, under the heading `ATO response', states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CSA does not accept the 2.5 times AWE default assessments (or a `realistic estimate') should be reported as outstanding debts. These assessments are only created when no income information is available for the liable parent for the previous five years. Deriving a `realistic estimate' in the absence of this information is not considered practical at this stage. As discussed in the ATO's response to recommendation 11, CSA will review the findings of projects which have examined default assessments, to determine if such an assessment can be found. All default assessments which are created on the basis of some historic income information are treated as `realistic estimates'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the ones where they have information&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and already included in the figures for outstanding debts.</PARA>
<PARA>So one would assume that, where it says 2 1/2 times average weekly earnings, they are not included. I thank the minister for clearing that up. I say to him that I, along with members of my committee, would welcome the opportunity to revisit that matter with the Child Support Agency and lay the possible confusion to rest once and for all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make a comment about reducing the cap benefiting the best off. The reason the Department of Social Security gave for the CSEAG's recommendation that it be set at the same level recommended by my committee&mdash;it was not because of the ministerial committee&mdash;that is, at 2 1/2 times average weekly earnings, was that those custodial parents who felt they were entitled to more income would be forced to go to the Family Court for a departure application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said many times, one of the big improvements was the introduction of the CSRO process. That has obviated the necessity for people to go, and the worry that they might not be able to afford to go, to the Family Court. Therefore, the reason for increasing that cap from two to 2 1/2 times no longer exists. We recommend that it go back to the original amount. Very few non-custodial parents are earning above twice the average weekly income, so very few people are going to be affected by that particular change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Mr Deputy Speaker, the other thing that I draw to your attention and the attention of the House is that we have introduced a minimum payment of $260 per annum. Many custodial parents and their children will, under our recommendations, for the first time receive child support payments. I admit that the payments will be very small, but many people will receive them for the first time. I think it was perhaps something that was done in haste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to emphasise again that I thank the minister for assuring the House that it will receive a calm and detailed response. I am happy to discuss&mdash;as I am sure members of my committee are&mdash;any of the issues that may be raised from such an examination. In the spirit of not wishing to prolong this disagreement about the collection rate, I accept what the minister says. I hope he accepts that our conclusions were based on information we believed we had got from either the Child Support Agency or the DSS. It would be most helpful if we could organise a meeting to lay some things to rest once and for all. I thank the House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this bill is to make a number of technical amendments to the Moomba-Sydney Pipeline System Sale Act 1994 and the Pipeline Authority Act 1973. The first of these amendments will ensure that the Moomba-Sydney pipeline can be licensed under state laws. The second category of amendments will facilitate the transfer of certain easements from the Pipeline Authority to ICI. The Pipeline Authority is currently obtaining easements for ICI to support the construction and operation by ICI of a new pipeline to transport ethane from Moomba in South Australia through Queensland and to Botany in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time when the Moomba-Sydney pipeline was sold in June of this year, it was generally agreed that this was the most complex privatisation project undertaken by the government to date.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only were the parties involved required to meet a very tight time frame, but the sale itself involved the transfer of all pipeline assets to the new owners, but with the Commonwealth retaining a joint ownership interest in the easements in which the pipeline runs. Further, the sale legislation had to take account of the Moomba to Botany ethane pipeline project, which at that stage was still being developed between the Pipeline Authority and ICI. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task was not an easy one. The fact that the pipeline sale was completed on target and was able to also accommodate the future requirements of the ethane project attests to the determination and professionalism of all parties involved. The fact that the need for some technical amendments to the sale act has become necessary is, in the circumstances, not surprising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments I am introducing today are essentially in two categories. The first addresses some concerns which were raised by the New South Wales government after the passage of the sale act with regard to its impact on the operation of state pipeline licensing laws. It was put to the Commonwealth that the legislation, as it stood, may have prevented state licensing laws applying to private sector pipelines running in easements in which the Commonwealth had an ownership interest. It was never the government's intention that state licensing laws should not apply to the Moomba-Sydney pipeline after its sale to East Australia Pipeline Ltd or, indeed, to any other private sector pipelines operating in these easements. Advice received from the Commonwealth Solicitor-General indicated that the problem as perceived by New South Wales did not, in his view, arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as the New South Wales Solicitor-General took a somewhat different view on this issue, the government agreed to introduce an amendment in this session to put this matter beyond doubt. Accordingly, I am now proposing the required amendments that will clarify and acknowledge the application of state pipeline licensing laws in the relevant circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that these changes will not affect the conditions under which the Moomba to Botany ethane pipeline is being constructed by the Pipeline Authority for ICI. The authority is undertaking the construction process, utilising immunities from state laws available to it under its own act. Once the authority withdraws from this project, however, these immunities will cease and ICI will become subject to those state licensing laws which these amendments are designed to uphold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second group of amendments relates specifically to this Moomba to Botany pipeline project that will bring ethane for use as a feed stock to ICI's plastics manufacturing plant. In September, after considerable negotiation, ICI was able to finally secure sufficient quantities of ethane from the Cooper Basin producers for this important project to proceed. At the same time, the South Australian government approved the sale of these ethane reserves by the Cooper Basin gas producers to ICI. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This in turn cleared the way for pipeline construction contracts to be let. The Pipeline Authority will initially be responsible for building this pipeline, and it is also obtaining those additional easements that will be required specifically for the ethane pipeline. As part of the agreed basis for this project, ownership of those easements being specifically obtained for the ethane pipeline by the Pipeline Authority are to be transferred to ICI once they have been secured. It is appropriate that the responsibilities and obligations of owning these ethane-specific easements should ultimately rest with the organisation that will own the pipeline itself. This is particularly so in this instance, where ICI is meeting all the costs associated with obtaining these new easements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inclusion of specific provisions in the bill by which to effect the transfer of ethane pipeline easements has a particular purpose. It reflects the Commonwealth's undertaking to facilitate, to the extent possible, the subsequent registration by ICI of its ownership of these easements with state titles offices. Whether or not this will ultimately occur is a matter for the states to determine. The Commonwealth cannot give any undertaking to ICI on this matter of registration but has sought to enhance the prospect of this occurring by including specific transfer provisions in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst these amendments are technical in nature, they are nonetheless small but important steps in the overall context of the government's gas reform agenda. They will enable the Commonwealth to continue the process of disengagement from its involvement in the construction and operation of gas pipelines, allowing it to focus its attention on the creation of a pro-competitive market environment in the gas industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sale of the Moomba-Sydney natural gas pipeline to the private sector and the private ownership of the ethane pipeline project illustrate the confidence that business has in the future of Australia's gas industry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Pipeline Legislation Amendment Bill follows the passage of the Moomba-Sydney Pipeline System Sale Act 1994 earlier this year and the subsequent sale of the Moomba-Sydney pipeline. In the sale, the Australian Gas Light Co., AGL, in New South Wales acquired 51 per cent of the pipeline from the Commonwealth, with the other 49 per cent sold to a consortium, including Novacorp International, based in Canada, and Petronas, owned by the Malaysian government. This pipeline transports natural gas 1,300 kilometres from the Cooper Basin in South Australia to the metropolitan centres of Sydney and Canberra, and a number of regional centres in New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Construction of the pipeline was originally proposed by AGL, but it was eventually built some 20 years ago by the Commonwealth government. Since then, the pipeline has been operated by the government through the auspices of the National Pipeline Authority. At the time of construction, AGL sought first refusal should the pipeline ever be sold, and the gas producers in Moomba also obtained rights in the event that the pipeline was sold. The New South Wales government also maintained an interest in the pipeline as the principal source of natural gas for New South Wales. Thus the sale of the pipeline as part of the government's asset sales program was an intricate process requiring accommodation of all interested parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it took five years to sell the pipeline, much of that time was wasted in a lengthy and expensive battle with AGL as to the legality of its right to first refusal. Having fought off the government's legal challenges, AGL finally realised its option of obtaining commercial control of the pipeline, while the gas producers in Moomba agreed to compensation of $20 million to waive their rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Moomba-Sydney Pipeline System Sale Act 1994, which gave effect to the sale, was of considerable complexity as all the various rights, options and issues were unravelled and resolved. Given the determination of the government to complete the sale by 30 June this year, the original bill was hurriedly considered by this parliament. For instance, the government provided 42 pages of amendments to its own bill for the opposition to consider, just one day before the amendments were debated. In view of its complexity and the speed with which the original bill was considered, it is not surprising that there are issues which now need to be tidied up with amending legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before the House will amend the Pipeline Authority Act 1973 and the Moomba-Sydney Pipeline System Sale Act 1994 in minor and non-controversial ways. The first group of amendments will ensure that the Moomba-Sydney pipeline can be licensed under state laws. After the passage of the Moomba-Sydney Pipeline System Sale Act, the New South Wales government raised the issue of its impact on the operation of state pipeline licensing laws. The New South Wales Solicitor-General was of the view that the legislation may have prevented state licensing laws applying to private sector pipelines running in easements in which the Commonwealth had an ownership interest. This set of amendments has been introduced by the government to put that matter beyond doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second group of amendments contained in this bill relates to a pipeline project which will bring ethane for use as a feedstock to a plastics manufacturing plant owned by ICI in Botany, Sydney. On behalf of ICI, the National Pipeline Authority is currently obtaining easements to support the construction and operation by ICI of a new pipeline to transport ethane from Moomba in South Australia through Queensland to Botany. As a result of this legislation, the transfer of easements from the Pipeline Authority to ICI will be finalised. There will be no financial impact as the cost of obtaining the easements for the ethane pipeline is being met by ICI. In the interests of concluding these matters rapidly, the coalition supports the passage of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a couple of more general comments regarding the gas industry. The gas industry in Australia today is still relatively immature. To put it another way, the potential for it is enormous. By saying that it is immature, I do not mean that it is not competitive, lean or efficient. It is all of those things. The players in the industry are as astute and committed as those in any other dynamic industry. But it has grown up in the shadow of the oil industry and has long been dominated by oil because of the higher expected financial returns, ease of storage and use for transport, and the higher calorific value of oil. Even now, the price of oil is a fundamental factor in assessing the financial return for large gas projects such as the North West Shelf. However, there have been developments in this regard in recent days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very encouraging to honourable members to see negotiations under way between the North West Shelf operators and the Japanese buyers of liquefied natural gas from the North West Shelf. I understand that there has been a spirit of goodwill in the talks on future pricing, which augurs well for a fair outcome for all concerned. This is especially important, given the enormous significance of the project for Australia's economy and international reputation. It is no secret that Japan is facing difficult decisions as to the quantity and mix of energy it employs, particularly in the light of addressing the greenhouse effect. Further, there are indications of an imminent shortage of LNG around the turn of the century. Thus, Australian LNG stands as an environmentally friendly, competitively priced energy source which will be in great demand however Japan addresses these future issues. As a result, there should be increasing returns for Australia which no doubt will be reflected in the final outcome of the pricing negotiations now under way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Oil itself has not always provided the financial return expected, but that is another story. That gas is shaking off this domination is without doubt. The enduring icon of the oil industry used to be a rig in the ocean, photographed at dusk, with a huge gas flare rising from a chimney, symbolising the enormous amounts of suppressed energy ready to work for consumers and an industry that never slept, with the gas extracted clearly secondary to the liquid gold. That is not so today. Today you would be hard pressed to find an oil platform flaring gas. A platform operator pursuing such a policy would have to have some strong justification&mdash;and not just because of heightened environmental awareness in the community. Accountants would be wondering why the gas was not being reinjected to boost the extraction of condensates or being collected for sale elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This change in the perception of gas has had a marked effect in many areas. Only 20 years ago Rex Connor, Whitlam's Minister for Minerals and Energy, was nationalising the Moomba-Sydney pipeline, taking it out of the private sector, which he thought could not be trusted to handle it properly, and putting into the hands of the federal government as a national asset. Rex Connor's vision was of a gas pipeline network which would stretch from one side of Australia to another, providing easy access to gas for every consumer. But it did not happen then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a start, Jim Cairns, the then Treasurer, could not find the money, and gas as a commodity did not justify such an investment by the private sector. The financial sums did not add up, and there was the problem of demarcations along state borders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the Moomba-Sydney pipeline has now been sold back to the private sector indicates that the benefits of a vibrant gas industry are being realised by governments and that the importance of gas as a commodity is being increasingly appreciated. Why else would BHP Petroleum have recently altered its focus towards significant investments in gas and be proposing a network of gas pipelines in the eastern states? Why else would gas have reached a massive 17 per cent of the primary energy market in Australia in the last 25 years?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To my mind, the Australian Gas Association mission statement has exactly the right focus in striving for 20 per cent of primary energy demand by the year 2000. Nothing else will be as beneficial to the industry as the achievement of greater market share. The availability of gas to the consumer market is continually increasing, and as this coverage increases so does the associated innovation and technology advance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The perception of gas as a non-renewable fossil fuel is being replaced with an appreciation of the environmental benefits of gas in the community. In fact, these benefits are so strong that recently the government itself was caught by surprise. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be interested to know that a few weeks ago the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) launched the energy card, which gives a discount to consumers buying greenhouse friendly domestic water heaters. However, he claimed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the increased use of solar water heaters is the single largest technical opportunity to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from the energy sector in the short to medium term.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately for him, the minister had not completed his homework assignment. The Energy Research and Development Corporation&mdash;which comes under the minister's own portfolio&mdash;concluded in a report dated June this year that gas heating offered the best domestic greenhouse result. The report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . an informed electric water heater owner seeking to pursue a cost effective personal greenhouse gas reduction strategy&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and do we not all&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">would not adopt solar where conventional natural gas water heating is available.</PARA>
<PARA>Even the federal government is yet to properly appreciate just how good gas technology is when it comes to environmental matters. Compared with other resource industries, the gas industry is characterised by long lead times for development of a resource; dispersed markets concentrated in capital cities; high capital costs; and high transportation costs. Critical to the future of the gas industry is the encouragement of exploration. If the incentive for investment in exploration is missing, there must inevitably be restraints on the development of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I, like most if not all honourable members, believe exploration is the key to the future of the industry in the long term, there are even more immediate issues which require attention. In this regard, the gas industry in Australia is beginning to reach critical mass in terms of overcoming the vast distances between supplies and the demand centres in the capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the next decade many new pipelines will be laid and&mdash;at least in the eastern states&mdash;we will see an interstate gas grid emerge. The small number of existing operations will start to link up and begin to interact in a fundamentally competitive way. The introduction of competition to monopoly markets will cause some headaches with issues of third party access to pipelines, adjudication on anti-competitive practices and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At least we on my side of politics expend a great amount of time thinking about how to disentangle industries from governmental ties of one sort or another. Largely, I am very happy to continue with that goal. That is not because I come to these issues with an especially vigorous ideological perspective, but because I simply suspect that commonsense dictates that there are such things as commercial imperatives and natural developments in markets which governments should not overlook. That is, if you want to run a business, you have to be fairly businesslike in the way you go about it. The next 10 years will be very different for the gas industry than the past decade has been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The times ahead will be about planning and consolidating the industry's infrastructure and reserves base and getting its commercial relationships right between producers, suppliers, distributors and consumers so it can have a straight run at emerging market opportunities. There are highly prospective markets in the electricity generation sector&mdash;which, hopefully, the national grid will facilitate still further&mdash;and in co-generation; manufacturing; end-use appliances, such as whole house ducting; and in the transport sector. I would have to say, however, that the markets and the likely rates of demand still lack definition and, because of this, all are facing a future growth pattern which will require some flexibility on the part of all the players in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In such an environment, the last thing the industry needs is a complex regulatory presence by governments at either the state or federal levels. Volatile industries which are still modelling their demand for the future are very vulnerable to interventionist policies. They are very vulnerable to investment distortions, to bad risk management processes, to confused price signals and to uneven market developments. I think this is true for gas producers as well as for the end-use of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the upstream industry, the AGA's own supply and demand scenarios foresee pipeline infrastructure investments ranging from between $2 and $3 billion to $11 billion over the next 10 to 15 years. Even at the more modest end of the spectrum, these investments are of such a magnitude relative to the size of the national economy that we cannot afford to skew the decision making in any way. To this, I would add a few other points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian natural gas industry faces competition on price from across the whole energy market and, in particular, from alternative fuels. That is a point which policy makers often overlook. The industry faces growing costs, increasing demand and, hopefully, a growing number of sources of supply as well. So there are a lot of pressures at work in the industry as it is. It is a big ask for the public policy process, but I would like to think that, on the lessons of the past, we might be able to get it right with the natural gas industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gas is a product which is marketable; that is, it is a clean energy source which should be able to capitalise on enormous goodwill if marketed deftly. It is a primary energy source with surrounding technologies which can yield very high rates of efficiencies, especially in electricity generation and co-generation. Moreover, it has a production and distribution process which does not require a team of public relations experts to defend it. The industry is ecologically inoffensive. It beats being in asbestos or the like. If the industry can settle its intra-industry relationships on an open and commercial basis and if governments can control the temptation to dabble and devise sectoral plans for the industry, then gas has got a better show than most of being able to be an industry that contributes to the economy over the long haul. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pretty sure the industry can look after itself. Nothing illustrates this better than the development of the code of practice for access to interstate gas transmission pipelines. I am not naive enough to think that governments can in all circumstances vacate the field, but I do not think they should be the first option in regulatory matters. The pipeline access code, devised by the major industry groupings within the natural gas sector&mdash;the AGA, APEA and APIA&mdash;and settled with the advice of the Trade Practices Commission, demonstrates the ability of the industry to cut its own path and settle contentious issues without government intervention. The code deserves a decent chance&mdash;a proper test run. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It deeply concerns me that the drift in government policy is back to a public sector generated regulatory regime for the industry under the guise of improving competition. A regime which meddles in the industry rather than guiding it would be a chronic irritant to the commercial processes which the industry must be exposed to if it is to evolve sensibly and efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Hilmer reforms, the TPC and the Prices Surveillance Authority will be subsumed by the new competition commission. Establishment of the new commission provides a firm opportunity to develop a fresh approach, unencumbered by the mistakes and excesses of the past. The new body also provides an opportunity to jettison the mind-set that has become entrenched within the TPC and PSA in regard to the gas industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A transparent competition framework based on the Hilmer reforms could reduce the uncertainty, costs and delays associated with these intrusions. However, I must admit to fearing that any government regulatory regime will inexorably lead to bureaucratic and expensive intervention in the marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Personally, I simply wish governments would spend more of their time attempting to create the across economy conditions which lead to sustainable growth for industries and restrict their role in regulatory matters affecting the resources and energy sector to facilitating commercial arrangements between relevant parties, smoothing out taxation regimes and ensuring  permits and licences are granted and land access concerns are minimised. These are sufficiently complex and responsible tasks in their own right for governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia we do not have many opportunities to watch new industries grow and develop. For this reason, the natural gas industry is an exciting industry to watch. It has got the shape and character of the next generation of Australia written all over it. I can only hope and trust that governments do right by it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was speaking on Appropriation Bill (No. 3), Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) just prior to question time in the last sittings. I had focused my attention at the time on the areas of local government that I have a particular interest in with my portfolio responsibility. I had focused on the failure of the government to adequately address the general purpose grants, the contributions it makes annually to local government from the revenue it receives from the taxpayers of this nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I touched on the importance of considering the impact that fly-in fly-out arrangements of mining operations have on the communities affected by those decisions, particularly on local government. I think the federal government has also failed to look adequately at the transient population, particularly in tourist areas, and the impact it has on the responsibilities of local governments. It is failing to respond to those needs through the general purpose grants. In fact, it is not even a consideration of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general, local government's new responsibilities have been willingly accepted and dealt with as efficiently and productively as possible. Australian local government has confidence in it own abilities as a sphere of government to accept new challenges and responsibilities. However, what concerns local authorities is the federal government's reluctance to adequately resource local government so that it may properly execute its new and additional responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One example is the manner in which many councils today have responsibility for their local airports. In fairness to the government, there was a local airports plan under which most of these councils were handed over airports in an improved fashion, or the tarmac had been improved. But the fact is that today many of these councils now have a resource, the local airport, that is vital infrastructure for the community and they have the responsibility for the ongoing maintenance of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of these local airports in rural Australia do not get sufficient landing fees from aircraft to match the maintenance demands of the airports. So many of these communities are disadvantaged because of that additional responsibility. The federal government continues to rip money out of the system in the form of taxes on avgas, mogas and jet fuel, but we see very little of this going back to those local governments to assist with the maintenance of those airports. Notwithstanding that there was an agreement to have these airports taken over by local governments&mdash;and in many instances it was against their wishes&mdash;consideration still needs to be given to some of those airports in rural and remote Australia where the landing fees are not sufficient to fund the necessary maintenance of those airports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is just one example where the additional responsibilities of local government are a drain on its resources and in turn they have to be funded from somewhere. In these cases they are being funded by local taxpayers in the form of their local rates. In the absence of specific payments, it is obviously the expectation of the federal government that these matters would be funded from general purpose grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, despite the addition of new duties and responsibilities on local government, general purpose grants have remained static. In real dollar terms there has been no significant increase&mdash;in fact, a very slight decrease&mdash;in the value of general purpose grants provided to local government authorities since 1983, since the Labor Party came to the treasury bench of this nation. However, during the same period, the federal government's total taxation revenue has continued to skyrocket. In 1983 general purpose grants to local government in this nation accounted for 1.03 per cent of total tax revenue and in 1994 they amounted to just 0.79 per cent&mdash;a proportional reduction of around 25 per cent in terms of those general purpose grants since 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These figures completely belie the rhetoric of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who ramble ad nauseam about their apparent partnership with local government. During the Prime Minister's address to the recent national general assembly of local government held here in Canberra, he said, `I want us to continue to work together&mdash;in partnership&mdash;for the good of the nation.' We have all heard this sort of rhetoric from the Prime Minister before, but it is never a genuine commitment. The rhetoric is never matched by commitment to support, in this case, local authorities with financial assistance. The reality for most local authorities is that this so-called partnership is very lopsided and unbalanced. The Commonwealth continues to expect more and more of local authorities and, ultimately, the ratepayers are left to pick up the tab. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, in my own electorate of Maranoa&mdash;one of the worst drought affected areas of this nation&mdash;we are seeing more and more national parks being gazetted. In the Diamantina shire, in the west of my electorate, Diamantina Lakes, a large cattle station, has recently been converted to a national park. Turning that property into a national park does have an effect on local government. When it becomes a national park, it is not rateable land, so 17 per cent of the revenue that the Diamantina Shire Council receives annually will be tied up in that national park. The council will effectively lose 17 per cent of its rate revenue because that property has been gazetted as a national park. Sure, we agree with the need for national parks. No-one disputes that, but we have to compensate these local authorities for those sorts of decisions where their revenue base is eroded by other needs and expectations of society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time this government met its rhetoric with some cold hard cash. It is simply not possible for many local authorities to drain their ratepayers any more than they currently do. In many drought stricken areas, councils' rating revenue has been severely restricted. There has been no growth in their revenue. They have tried to play their part in assisting the ratepayers of their communities, because the impact of the drought goes far beyond the farm gate. It extends into the small business sector and the local authorities are affected as well. The councils are not seeing any growth in revenue and they are playing their part in assisting those communities to contain their costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, as local government authorities are unable to independently access Loan Council approved borrowings, the revenue provided through general purpose grants assumes an even greater importance to them. There is no doubt about the significance of the general purpose grants to local authorities, particularly those that are small, regional or in rural or remote Australia. Their only alternative source of income is contracting work and even that is under a heavy cloud as a result of federal and state governments' indecision on the specifics and a timetable for a national competition policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effects of the increasing responsibility and the static level of funding is revealed by considering the vertical fiscal imbalance; in other words, the imbalance in this case between all three public sector levels. The vertical fiscal imbalance ratio measures the relationship between own source revenue and own purpose outlays for each level of government. A ratio of one indicates an equal balance between revenue and outlays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth government's ratio for the year 1992-93 stands at 1.23, indicating its revenue vastly exceeds its outlays. The ratio for state and territory governments is 0.5 and for local government, 0.72. This ratio reveals a situation where state, territory and local governments are handling an increasing and disproportionate amount of service and program delivery. However, the federal government's ever tightening grip on public finance is quite clearly failing to accommodate these responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the Commonwealth continues to lecture local government about the virtues of efficiency, value for money and accountability, this comparison clearly reveals the government could learn a thing or two from local government about stretching public sector dollars. At the same time as the federal government has been pandering to the lobby group of the month, funding extravagant and pointless make work schemes and meekly marching to the beat of its union masters, local government has been quietly going about the task of meeting community needs and demands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local authorities have accepted the need to improve their efficiency, not because the Commonwealth demanded they do so but because they have a genuine interest in providing ratepayers with value for money and because they know only too well the federal government's fiscal commitment to local government is dwindling yearly. Many had embraced competitive tendering, resource sharing and enterprise bargaining long before the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister became born-again reformists. Others found different ways to drive the rates dollar further. Some looked for corporate solutions. Some embraced good old-fashioned frugality&mdash;something this government would not understand. Many of these local authorities not only have met these challenges but also have some cash reserves&mdash;something that this government knows nothing of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not to say that all local governments are beyond improvement. Many have a long way to go. Some will dispute the way in which reform progresses, but most governments understand the importance of local government efficiency&mdash;most, that is, except the federal government. There have been no rewards forthcoming from the government, just a continual downgrading of financial support and resources and ongoing ignorance of the important work of local government in bringing community leaders together and identifying and meeting their needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure the government that such failure to recognise the value of local government, with the appropriate resourcing and support, does not go unnoticed by local government authorities of this nation, their 160,000 strong work force or the millions of Australian ratepayers. It is time the federal government shared more adequately the tax revenue that it receives from the taxpayers of this nation with local government right around this nation. We truly saw a commitment to local government in this nation. We, on this side of the House, acknowledge that there are three tiers of government in this nation. We are prepared to share the tax revenue with the third tier of government, local government.

The purpose of these schemes is for a number of apprentices to be employed by the groups and, therefore, effectively be made available to a number of smaller employers who might not have otherwise been able to provide training to apprentices or participate in their training. On the other hand, these schemes have the thoroughly worthwhile aim of enabling apprentices to have quite wide ranging and broad based training with a number of employers over the period of their apprenticeship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These schemes work by a subsidy, under appropriation, from the Commonwealth government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I want to deal with a group apprenticeship scheme known as the MBA (ACT) group apprenticeship scheme. It has been brought to my attention&mdash;I have been given a number of documents which seem to indicate this quite clearly&mdash;that there are grave concerns about the way this scheme is being run by this organisation. In the public interest, I think these documents ought to be made available to the public. I intend to read a number of them to the parliament tonight. The first is a statutory declaration. It states:</PARA>

<PARA>Another matter is dealt with, after which the statutory declaration's recital is signed Craig James Murphy. The fourth and final document states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I, Karen Sheedy</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">do solemnly and sincerely declare</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was employed by the MBA in the position of Assistant Manager of the MBA Group Apprenticeship Scheme on the 16th of November 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During my employment, it became my responsibility to place apprentices with Host Employers for the apprentice to obtain their on-the-job training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From time-to-time it became extremely hard to meet the needs of the industry in its quest to train young people, because my work force (apprentices) would disappear to places unknown to me. This was due to Mr Allan Wright, who is the Manager of the Scheme, contacting out of work apprentices out of hours and demanding that they work on private jobs for him.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Quite often when I asked Allan Wright if he knew where an apprentice was when I was unable to contact him, I was told to mind my own business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This incident would happen regularly when Matthew Pike, an apprentice Plumber with the Group Scheme, was out of work. It was an MBA requirement that when an apprentice was out of work that they were contactable. When I asked Matthew where he was and what he was doing on one occasion he told me that he had received a phone call from Allan Wright the night before and was told that he was to go to Bernie Bryant's (Executive Director of the MBA) unit at Emu Ridge to work. I protested as I had work for Matthew with a Host Employer. To the best of my knowledge Matthew was paid by the MBA Group Apprenticeship Scheme under the classification of down-time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another incident was when Bernie Bryant asked me if I had any Apprentice Painters out of work. I advised him that I didn't and that an apprentice was on leave. He became very annoyed. I felt very pressured and called Jason Perrin (Apprentice Painter) who was on leave at home, to ask him whether he would be interested in doing some work at Bernie's place. I told him that he was to call Bernie and talk to him about the job.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A short time later Simon Borwell (Apprentice Painter) was out of work. When he did not ring in at 8.30am which was an MBA requirement when out of work, I called his house. I spoke to his wife and she advised me that Simon was working. Upon asking Allan Wright where Simon was he told me that he was at Bernie's helping Jason Perrin finish the job.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not aware of whether Jason Perrin was paid any monies for the work completed at Bernie Bryant's house. To the best of my knowledge Simon Borwell was paid by the MBA Group Apprenticeship Scheme down-time included in his normal pay.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other apprentices who Allan Wright arranged work for without my notification, to work on residences belonging to Bernie Bryant were Craig Murphy-Apprentice Carpenter and Joiner, Lindsay Newman-Apprentice Carpenter, Andrew Hill-Apprentice Bricklayer, Simon Oates-Apprentice Electrician, Jason Perrin-Apprentice Painter, Simon Borwell-Apprentice Painter and Derrick Hehir-Apprentice Carpenter and Joiner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Discussions with some of these apprentices has revealed, I believe, payment for such work was part of their normal pay from the MBA Group Apprenticeship Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have discussed the work completed by Lindsay Newman and he told me that even though he worked on weekends at Bernie Bryant's residence that he did not receive any form of payment. Upon discussing this further with Lindsay in relation to complaining about this, he stated that he had grave fears for his job at the MBA if he did forward any form of complaint.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I had no control over the allocation of work for apprentices and when I asked Allan Wright, I was told very aggressively to mind my own business. On a number of occasions when I attempted to contact apprentices who were out of work, I found that these apprentices would be off working at Allan Wright's direction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite my objection to apprentices doing work other than for Host Employers, this practise continued.</PARA>
<PARA>Then there is a recital and the document is signed. The allegations contained in those statutory declarations are of considerable concern and are serious. There are other allegations which have been made to me concerning the ACT MBA group scheme, which I do not intend to deal with tonight. Now that it has been raised, the appropriate thing now is for the minister to order a full investigation of this scheme to explore fully all of the allegations of impropriety. If the cooperation of the MBA and its scheme are not forthcoming, and if the department does not have appropriate powers to deal with the matter, the matters ought to be referred to the Federal Police, who would have the powers to investigate the affairs of the MBA as well as the group scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea that people working on group schemes should be required to undertake work for essentially the administrative officers who are employing them is a repugnant suggestion. This is particularly serious because of the fact that this is not simply a private organisation. In fact, these are organisations which are fully or in part funded by the Australian government&mdash;and in this case I think also the ACT government. Because of that funding, it takes on an added seriousness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have just had the example in Melbourne of a senior executive of the Coles Myer corporation doing similar things to those alleged here, although I must say on a somewhat more grand scale in the case of Brian Quinn who, as I recall, has now been dealt with by the courts. Nonetheless, the principle is the same here with the exception, to some extent, that this matter is even more serious because of the fact that in this case, if these allegations are correct, we are seeing the misuse, the misappropriation, of public moneys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, this matter is a serious one. It needs to be referred to the minister. It needs to be dealt with expeditiously. If there is misuse of public funds going on, obviously this particular group scheme should have its funding suspended at an early time and its books ought to be thoroughly examined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other allegations which I do not intend to deal with tonight. The matters I have dealt with are of sufficient seriousness, and quite clearly we should have a wide ranging investigation. If the investigation shows that there has been criminal conduct in this matter, apart from simple behaviour which administratively is not acceptable, then the appropriate action ought to be taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be the case that the public can be reassured that, when public funds are being spent, every last dollar, every last cent, is accounted for properly and that no money whatsoever is misappropriated for private use. Anybody who does so ought to undergo the full rigour of the law and ought to be dealt with appropriately. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we reside in A Riding Dubbo, PP Board we are not in an exceptional circumstance area.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After approximately 2 weeks, this application was rejected on the grounds that I could not be available for full time work. On the advice of our accountant I filled my form in very honestly and stated that due to my husband's ill health I could not travel 60 kms to work in Dubbo not only because of the mechanical condition of our car, but because my husband has spent a month in Sydney in a private hospital being treated for depression and is still on medication for this condition. This I feel is a legitimate reason why he cannot be left alone while I go away to work. I was also informed when I was asked about a sickness benefit, that I could not prove that my husband's illness had caused us loss of income.</PARA>

The nonsense of this has put an added strain onto all staff connected with the airport. It has put an unnecessarily unbearable strain on the people of Kurnell. I want to make the point tonight that the decision to open the runway was not a decision by the Federal Airports Corporation or the CAA. It was a political decision. We have to bear in mind the fact that the opening of the third runway by the Prime Minister on 4 November was purely political. No-one in their right mind would have thought of opening a runway before the control tower was finished. It is obvious to all who pass by that airport that the control tower is nowhere near finished. Having been the member since 1966, I can assure you that until now Kurnell has never had planes flying directly overhead. This means that they are also flying directly over an oil refinery. </PARA>

I believe it will have a radical effect on the result of the next federal election in New South Wales in a way that members opposite will not like to see but, I hope, in a way that members on our side will be happy to see.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It gives me great pleasure because ethanol as an additive has proved once again to be an outstanding fuel. For those people unaware of the energy challenge, I would like to say that this challenge not only compares distance travelled by vehicles against fuel consumption but, more importantly, measures greenhouse gas emissions. Many Australians will be interested to know the results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales Transit Authority, for example, entered two buses: one was a brand new high-tech gas powered vehicle and the other was an old Mercedes with a tank full of diesohol, a revolutionary new fuel based on ethanol and developed by an Australian company, APACE Research. The result? The diesohol powered bus romped it in with a 15 per cent lower greenhouse gas index. The heavy transport section was won by diesohol powered vehicles. They finished first and second and also emitted the lowest readings by far of greenhouse gas. This is the third year in a row that the overall winner of the event was an unmodified heavy-duty truck powered by diesohol and entered by Boral Transport and APACE Research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These results have vital implications for all Australians. Not only can diesohol contribute to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions; it can create jobs and it can reduce our dependence on imported fuels. Dr Russell Reeves of APACE Research, who developed this revolutionary technology, is a world leader. He is one of those scientists in whom Australia can take the greatest of pride. APACE holds the world patent for blending ethanol with diesel, and the company is now seeking a partner to develop a new process of producing ethanol from woody tissue and forest waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have supported this new industry. Our government has provided a grant to construct a trial ethanol from woodchip plant. In the budget this year, we subsidised the production of new ethanol to encourage investment in this exciting industry. A company such as Boral, one of the largest woodchip exporters in Australia, had the opportunity to invest $2 million in the construction of this trial plant. If it had done so, it would have got back in excess of $1 million in tax concessions in the first year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This same company is the major user of forestry resources in New South Wales. It had a golden opportunity to participate in an industry that could revolutionise the use of forest products, an industry that can create jobs where we need them most, an industry that can save our environment in a multitude of ways. But, unfortunately, Boral has elected not to participate. I have no doubt that the quick quid has won again. However, I am confident that APACE Research will find a partner. The 1994 energy challenge has shown what ethanol can do. The challenge now is for industry, with a genuine commitment to Australia's future, to grasp the opportunity to help Australia's future and that of the world, as well as its own. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight, I would like to say a few words about the Tunarama Festival which is held in Port Lincoln every year on the Australia Day holiday. Port Lincoln overlooks Boston Bay, one of the great harbours of Australia. Port Lincoln is noted for its tourist attractions. It is a beautiful city on the edge of this magnificent harbour. Port Lincoln is the home of the largest fishing fleet in the Southern Hemisphere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A highlight is the Tunarama Festival. There are a number of events on that weekend. The one that I will particularly focus on is the festival queen or king competition. This a charity event similar to the Miss Australia Quest. Entrants secure a sponsor and take part in a series of personal development sessions which enhance these young people in a very positive way. They select various charities, some of which are local and some of which are spread throughout the state and country, and raise money for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Entrants participate in three sessions on speech writing, structure and presentation with the Penguin Club and a mock session of the sashing night. Having been to the last two sashing nights at Port Lincoln, it is quite an event. It is a credit to these young people who have only ever spoken once or twice before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The entrants take part in two media training sessions with the local media. One involves an unprepared interview and the other is a taped interview. They review the tape and do it again. The progress they make in their presentations and relaxation is very evident. They have three half-hour deportment lessons and one radio media training night. They have a session on dining etiquette with presentation, serving and waiting by TAFE trainees. They are given advice on stress management and taught how to relate in a new role to family, friends and work mates. They are given advice by a dietitian from the Port Lincoln Hospital and they are given a lesson on skin care and make-up, hair grooming and styling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Their knowledge of the region is expanded with a mystery tour of historical and tourist attractions accompanied by the local TV crew. Background taping is done for a women's world interview and they visit tourist spots such as First Landing, Stenross Maritime Museum, the Marilyn Maine Gallery, tuna farms and tuna processors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Entrants come from all walks of life. The event has recently been opened to both sexes. They almost had a male entrant this year, but I understand that that is yet to occur. Currently the winner is called the Festival Queen. The biggest fundraiser is the Charity Queen and, as I mentioned, a  significant amount of money is raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Entrants need and get a great deal of family support. The organisers would like to broaden the area entrants come from. They currently come from the Eyre Peninsula towns, but in the future they could come from other areas throughout South Australia. The entrants this year are Christine Ayers, Anita White, Kylie Smith, Angela Rose, Simone Pieterman and Teresa Webb. They are a credit to themselves, to their trainers, to their parents and to their communities. This event will culminate on Australia Day 1995. I am sure this House would wish them all well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to acknowledge the presence of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the Illawarra region on 2 December. The Prime Minister was in the Illawarra region for the opening and launch of the Illawarra REDA, the regional economic development area. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would know that part of the government's policy in Working Nation was to address regional Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the recent launch of an Ulmer committee report on the strategies for the Shoalhaven, I noted that the government's policy on regionalism stretched back a long way. Perhaps the strongest push in that direction was during Gough Whitlam's days with the Department of Urban and Regional Development which had at its helm a man for whom I have great admiration&mdash;Tom Uren. In those days Tom Uren had the foresight to see that regional Australia is the engine house of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Honourable members would note from some of the recent reports that the highlights of economic development and the future of Australia, such as the provision of jobs, increased marketing and increased manufacture, have been in two areas: firstly, regional Australia and, secondly, small and medium business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been my great pleasure to fight and fight hard for representation for my electorate, which has 80,000 people. It is one-third of the Illawarra regional economic development area. I have pushed for the inclusion of representatives from the major industry in that region, which is tourism. Something like $315 million per year comes to the Illawarra region from tourism, with $265 million coming to the Shoalhaven area in the electorate of Gilmore. There are approximately six million visitation nights per annum. I have had great pleasure in nominating one Roger Summerill, a noted businessman and chairman of the Shoalhaven Tourist Board and the South-East Tourist Board, as a representative of that industry. I hope that will soon come to fruition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also noted the second powerhouse as a potential great growth area for employment, which is a significant factor in my electorate. Achieving employment is something that I have committed myself to assisting; that is, jobs for the children, the young folk, and jobs for those people in middle age, the family folk. Also, let us not forget those people aged 40-plus requiring jobs. It is often very difficult for those people to find employment having had long periods of employment. Their skills may have become redundant. The opportunities afforded to those in regional Australia are not as plentiful as those afforded in big cities. The Illawarra regional economic development area is a vital plank in the government's approach to bringing this nation to its full potential. The nation has achieved a great deal. My electorate particularly has realised great potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to note when I was launching the Ulmer study on strategies for the Shoalhaven that all is not what it seems. Many of the speakers who spoke before me talked about the worst recession for 60 years. I draw the attention of those speakers to one part of the report, to statistics that came directly from employers. Sixty-one per cent of employers interviewed had experienced employment growth over the last three years. That is something I do not believe those people understood or really took into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the Prime Minister for coming down to our region, and congratulate the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) for his foresight. I pledge myself to seeing that the whole of the Illawarra region progresses through this program&mdash;a magnificent program which shows the foresight of this government. I will fight hard particularly for those areas of my electorate to see that they are adequately represented, that all facets of business in those areas, particularly tourism and small business, are adequately addressed and that the strategies which come forward, which will basically be around transport, education and the provision of services to my area, are afforded great detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I finish by suggesting that the future lies in the regions. The future lies with small and medium sized business and their ability to get out there and market. We have a great number of exporters from our area. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Aboriginal people have lived in and roamed this great continent for 40,000 years, yet in the last 200 years, since the arrival of European settlers, much of that indigenous history, culture and tradition has either been destroyed or lost. Various efforts have been made to revive or restore that history and culture, but none is more important than the survival of the Aboriginal language.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indigenous history is a living thing, handed down and carried on by that language&mdash;the spoken word, the story telling. All too often this living link of language has disappeared. Tonight I commend the efforts of a dedicated group of people who have helped restore one such language, that of the Gooreng Gooreng tribe of central Queensland, which has just released a comprehensive dictionary containing 700 words and meanings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Gooreng Gooreng are a proud people. Their tribe, together with the Kabi and Wakka tribes, make up the Kabi nation, which dominates the central and south-eastern corner of Queensland. The Gooreng Gooreng consisted of eight clans and stretched from Bundaberg in the south to the Calliope River near Gladstone in the north and west to the Cania Gorge, near Monto. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, a point that white history books fail to record is that the Gooreng were probably the very first Aboriginal people to make contact with Captain Cook when he landed in 1770 to take fresh water at a spring in what is now known as the Town of 1770-Agnes Water, in the north-west of my electorate of Hinkler. Unfortunately, the Gooreng Gooreng, like many other tribes during the early part of this century, were murdered, starved or sent off to settlements like Woorabinda, Cherbourg and Palm Island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite this more recent turbulent history, the language of the Gooreng Gooreng has managed to survive through a handful of people. Gooreng elder Nyulang Johnson is just one of two people alive today who can speak the language fluently. In a foreword to his dictionary, Nyulang vividly recounts the slaughter of his people at Mount Colloseum and how his father and his language were saved. He states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am honoured at this opportunity to pass down my knowledge to the younger generations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I once had a dream that all our people would one day be able to speak our language as it was spoken in the past: that our culture would be rekindled and that we would grow together in unity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The publishing of the `English-Gooreng/Gooreng-English Dictionary' is like a realisation of that dream.</PARA>
<PARA>The disappearance of Aboriginal languages is quite frightening. According to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia</EMPHASIS>, it is estimated that 10 per cent of Aboriginal people still speak their indigenous tongue. Of the original 250 or so distinct languages, over two-thirds are either extinct or have only a handful of elderly speakers remaining. Of the surviving 90 languages, only 20 are actively transmitted to children and are spoken fluently by those children and adults in a wide range of activities. The other 70 remaining languages are progressively weakening and are not  being passed on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was against this difficult background that a deep and genuine concern for the future of their people that the Gurang Land Council has over the last five years actively sought to rediscover its origins through mapping significant sites, collecting artefacts and now reviving the language through this dictionary. Early next year they hope to release a history book telling in the printed word the story of the Gooreng people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I publicly acknowledge those associated with the dictionary. They include Nyulang Johnson, Konni Walker, Mervyn and Colin Johnson, and the principal author, George Helon, who is in fact an Australian genealogist of Polish descent. Those behind this unique publication see it as only the start, a beginning, to help their people to identify who they are and where they have come from. This dictionary provides a vital link between the past and the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the last sitting fortnight I was honoured to have been able to present copies of this book first to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), who received the book most graciously, and then to the Parliamentary Library for the benefit of all members and senators who serve in this place. I end with the words of the Gooreng elder Mervyn Johnson, nephew of Nyulang Johnson. He states:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">under the Scheme customers in extended zones have access to all other customers in their own zone at Pastoral rate (currently 25 cents for 4 1/2 minutes) as well as to their Community Service Town, both irrespective of the actual distances involved;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Film and Literature Board of Review, on appeal on 13 January 1993, directed that Salo be registered for importation under the Customs (Cinematograph Films) Regulations and that it be classified as `R'&mdash;for restricted exhibition subject to the condition that advertising matter prepared for the film by Premium Films, the applicant, be submitted to the Review Board for approval.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The FIRB is an advisory body only. It provides advice to the Government on the consistency of individual foreign investment applications with Government policy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Government monitors and regulates foreign investment. The Government's foreign investment policy encompasses both the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 and other requirements set down by Ministerial statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally, the Australian Government's policy is to welcome foreign investment. The Government recognises the substantial contribution foreign investment has made and can continue to make to the development of Australia's industries and resources. That said, the policy does not treat foreign investment in all sectors uniformly. There are a number of sectors in which foreign investment generates community concern about the level of foreign ownership and control. The sensitive sectors are media, real estate and civil aviation. Generally, the following restrictions apply:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Media: All proposals by foreign interests to invest in the media are subject to prior foreign investment approval. Foreign interests in broadcasting services are restricted to 15 per cent in the case of commercial television broadcasting services and 20 per cent for all subscription television broadcasting services licences. The maximum permitted foreign interest involvement in mass circulation newspapers by a single shareholder is 25 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Real Estate: All proposals by foreign interests to acquire residential real estate, irrespective of size, require prior foreign investment approval (unless exempt under the regulations). Proposals by foreign interest to acquire developed residential real estate are not normally approved except in the case of foreign companies buying for their senior executives resident in Australia, and foreign nationals temporarily resident in Australia for more than 12 months buying for their own use as a principal place of residence (subject to the sale of the property when they cease to reside in Australia). However, acquisitions of vacant land are approved subject to the land being developed within 12 months and up to 50 per cent of a new development may be sold `off the plan' or under construction to foreign interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Civil Aviation: Foreign airlines flying to Australia can generally expect approval to acquire up to 25 per cent of the equity in a domestic carrier individually or up to 40 per cent in aggregate. In the case of Australia's international flag carrier, Qantas, total foreign ownership is restricted to a maximum of 35 per cent in aggregate, with individual holdings limited to 25 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overriding criterion for assessing individual proposals is a contrary to the national interest test. If a proposal is found to be not contrary to the national interest it is considered to be consistent with the Government's foreign investment policy and therefore approved. In the case of a takeover bid for an Australian owned company, for example, while foreign investment approval may have been given by the Government, the ultimate decision to accept or reject any foreign takeover offer rests with the Australian shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Generally, those countries dependent on foreign capital, have foreign investment restrictions, to differing degrees, on certain types of foreign investment. Within Asia, the degree to which foreign investment is restricted varies greatly from one country to the next. For example, in Hong Kong, there is no limitation on the purchase of land by foreigners and, apart from restrictions on foreign investment in the banking and broadcasting sectors, there is no legislation regulating foreign investment. Indonesia, on the other hand, does not recognise the concept of freehold land rights. Instead various rights are attached to land and are subject to separate titles. The right of ownership is an inheritable right that can only be held by Indonesian citizens. Indonesia also restricts or totally prohibits foreign investment in many industry sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately each country has the prerogative to determine, according to its circumstances, the degree to which foreign investment should be restricted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, in recognition of benefits that would flow from the easing of restrictions on direct foreign investments, member countries have reached agreement on a non-binding set of investment principles, the aim of which is to encourage and facilitate investment flows within the region.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) From 1 December 1994 it will be necessary to obtain prior approval from the Health Insurance Commission (HIC) before prescribing a Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) "Authority required" item. This change was announced in the May 1994 Federal Budget and was the principal recommendation of a review of the PBS Authority system. This review was undertaken in collaboration with the major professional bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arrangements apply to drugs that are listed with an authority required restriction. The great majority of drugs are restricted due to medical reasons and there are some that have a cost-based authority. Except for existing cost based authority drugs, the new arrangements do not apply to drugs that cost in excess of $30.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remaining purely cost based authorities will be removed when the prior approval arrangements are working satisfactorily.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) Cost based authorities apply where the average cost of treatment with the drug is $30 or more and there is a cheaper treatment in the Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Under arrangements introduced in 1988 prescribers were able to supply authority prescriptions in urgent cases and notify HIC afterwards. This system was abused in that, in a significant proportion of cases, the prescriber did not subsequently notify HIC. It is estimated that up to 74% of authority prescriptions went through the urgent route and 30% were issued outside the authority requirement. Savings will be achieved through medication being supplied in accordance with the authority. These savings (net of additional administrative costs) are estimated to be in excess of $12 million per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Health Insurance Commission has upgraded its telephone facilities and introduced a new national free-call service for fast approval of the authority required items. The new free-call number is 1800 888 333 and is operational seven days a week, 24 hours a day. In addition to this, the Commission's existing free-mail service for the approval of authority required prescriptions will continue to operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To enable it to implement the new arrangements, the HIC has been provided with additional resources to upgrade and improve its telephone services. The cost of these additional  resources have been taken into account in determining the net savings referred to in 1(b) above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Advice of the change in arrangements commenced to pharmacists and prescribers in September 1994 with an article appearing in trade magazines and journals. Individual letters have been sent to all high prescribers of Authority drugs advising of the change and the HIC facilities available to gain approval. A letter to all prescribers is being mailed in November advising of the changes. This letter also encloses a brochure outlining the steps required to seek approval. The December PBS Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits together with MIMS (a widely used reference listing PBS and non-PBS drugs) will contain specific advertising of the Authority changes.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5T4">Mr Brereton</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) While the majority of issues concerning ballast water have to date been carried by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS), I have been provided with the following information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The results of the report to the Fishing Industry Research Committee were inconclusive and no measures to control ballast water discharge were introduced at that time. However, between October 1979 and March 1983, the ballast water issue was a regular agenda item considered by the former Marine and Ports Council of Australia (MPCA) (the functions of this Committee were absorbed by the Australian Transport Advisory Council in 1984.)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NSW State Fisheries Service continued its ballast water investigations and in 1982 submitted a report to MPCA. This report also indicated that there was no definite evidence that any imported parasitic marine organisms had any effect on indigenous marine organisms. It was forwarded to the Departments of Health and Business and Consumer Affairs to acknowledge the matter as a quarantine issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">MPCA subsequently asked the Australian Fisheries Council in March 1983 to advise it of any future action that may be taken on the management of ballast water discharge as the likely costs involved with any treatment measures would be of concern to the shipping industry and therefore the MPCA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no further involvement by the Department of Transport in this issue until the late 1980s when serious problems emerged concerning the introduction of foreign organisms in some areas of Tasmania. The issue was also raised at the 26th session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) in September 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Since 1989 the Federal government, through the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) has been particularly active in this matter carrying out a wide range of research on the issue, implementing Guidelines for international shipping for ballast water management, having these adopted by the International Maritime Organisation for international applications and devising a comprehensive ballast water monitoring and testing program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To bring together the many Commonwealth, State and industry sectors concerned with this issue AQIS organised a National Symposium in May 1994. As a direct result of this, there was unanimous agreement that Australia required a national strategy. In conjunction with industry and other groups, AQIS has completed a draft Australian Ballast Water Management Strategy which it is expected will shortly be released for widespread consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Strategy seeks to, inter alia, put in place a set of arrangements which will as far as practicable minimise the transfer of unwanted aquatic organisms to Australia from overseas ports, from Australian ports to overseas ports and the translocation between Australian ports with the minimum disruption and cost to international and domestic shipping and other industries such as seafood production.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes. The current method of authenticating Aboriginality is effective and believed to be non-discriminatory as it does not require clients to align themselves with incorporated bodies, only to obtain from them confirmation of their Aboriginality. In most circumstances there may be a number of organisations for individuals to chose to contact to obtain confirmation of Aboriginality. Where difficulties arise cases can be referred through ATSIC's Regional Offices to the appropriate elected ATSIC Regional Council for advice.</PARA>
