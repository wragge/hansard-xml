<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Asylum, border control and detention</EMPHASIS>, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8T4">Mr FERGUSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The document titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Asylum, border control and detention</EMPHASIS> endorses the overall thrust of Australia's existing immigration detention policy. In an inquiry which certainly demonstrated the value of our committee system, the report entails a sensible balance, for this investigation report welded varying nuances and involved significant compromise. For those reasons I would especially hope that it is acted upon, given the serious issue at stake and the work involved in this sometimes controversial policy area. The balance mentioned is between the needs of genuine refugee claimants, the conditions of applicants whilst detained and the need to ensure that Australia's migration scheme and border protection policies retain their integrity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee received numerous submissions after extending the closing date because of an earlier lack of response. These submissions overwhelmingly subscribed to a view that our current policies were too harsh, although the vast majority conceded the requirement for some detention. There were diverse attitudes on the length of permissible detention. Some actually believed that after preliminary identification, and somehow swiftly assessing criminal background and health risk from distant provinces, the people should be immediately released. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many referred to international conventions in what were often misinformed or, in some cases, contrived endeavours to portray Australia as breaching these undertakings. The documents generally referred to were the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The submissions were singularly unconvincing, being characterised by selective interpretation and legalism. They appeared unable to grasp that, whatever the technical difficulties with Australia's regime, refugees would be better served if other nations in our part of the world signed, ratified and adhered to these conventions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recourse to overclever readings of international requirements undermines the Australian electorate's belief in the value of international cooperation. It is a dangerous game to manipulate the bare essentials of international agreements. These are usually reached by compromise with less pluralist societies than our own. They attempt to enforce unprecedented requirements on these nations. It can only hurt our adherence to these conventions if polemicists sensationalise interpretations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were simultaneously a diverse range of church, community and other support groups with a deep concern for the fate of the detainees. These contributions, with the committee visits to Westbridge, Port Hedland and Perth, were persuasive in reaching the central recommendation that there should be a capacity to entertain release if detention exceeds six months and certain stipulations are met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has determined that, if continued detention arises from departmental inaction and administrative error, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs personally, and not by delegation, could consider release. The committee emphasises its opposition to any judicial review of the exercise of that discretion and stresses that we are dealing with discretion, the use of which cannot be compelled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other recommendations of the committee demonstrate concerns about the upturn of litigation in migration matters. As indicated earlier, the committee received evidence on international practices. It was convinced that the existing procedures and suggested alterations were not out of line with international standards. Few nations lack detention policies and the interest groups would be unimpressed by sterner European and US practices for turning around claimants at sea. The same people who cited very limited, rare US parole practices diverted their attention from the almost universal trend in Europe. Whether it be Sweden, the UK, France or Germany, the action is towards more trenchant measures to counter perceived manipulation of their previously liberal refugee admission policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has rejected the widespread view in middle Australia that boats should be turned around at sea, but has also countered the contention that those who undertake what is sometimes a dangerous sea voyage&mdash;risking pirate attack, drowning or starvation&mdash;are per se refugees and thus entitled to remain in Australia without examination. I am pleased to say that the submissions of some groups active in aiding refugee applicants persuaded the committee of the need for some changes in detention practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My own experience as the former representative for the Villawood area provided knowledge of Westbridge. Amongst the suggestions that I hope the minister will adopt are: consideration to allowing detainee children to attend local schools, in the appropriate circumstances; consideration to teaching detainee children in their native language; and, where a large group of unauthorised border arrivals from the one nationality are held in a detention centre, every effort should be made to engage the services of medical personnel who can provide regular consultations in their native language. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a noteworthy lack of appreciation amongst many making submissions as to the extent of abscondment. Most witnesses were surprised to learn, for instance, of the high proportion of PRC applicants who had treated our legal processes with disdain after an initial negative response. For those in constant contact with refugee applications and other aspects of the migration intake, there is a firm understanding that Australia is confronted by a proliferation of bogus claims. These are often engineered by advisers who have scant regard to the legislation's intent or to the integrity of the system. An expectation that people will persistently make themselves available to administrative and judicial review if they feel things are going badly is quixotic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many groups advocated release and promised assistance to these people. I believe they are generally trustworthy in these offers. Nevertheless, they showed minimal interest in providing enforceable guarantees to ensure compliance with any given undertakings. The committee was actually confronted with witnesses who expressed horror at the idea that they should act in what they perceived to be a `policeman' role. In the absence of more pro-active suggestions to counter threatened abscondment, the committee unfortunately had very restricted options on voluntary release. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unrealistic to suggest that people desperate to remain in Australia for whatever reason&mdash;without permanent housing and employment ties and often lacking immediate family&mdash;can be compared in bail and parole expectations with permanent residents. The more responsible media would do a service by indicating to the public the tendency to abscond rather than blithely ignoring it to orchestrate irresponsible changes to the policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some have argued that the 833 unauthorised border arrivals detained and held in custody during the period since 1 January 1990 have led to an overreaction. The reality is that the development of advanced transportation, continued connivance of some neighbouring countries and any sign of an easy admission policy would cause an explosion of numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, our island status represents a partial protection against, for instance, the Californian experience which was detailed in this week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS>. In California, State Governor Wilson has reliably claimed that there are two million undocumented immigrants in his state alone and that their numbers are growing by 100,000 per annum. Similarly in Europe, the continent is confronted by an unprecedented movement of people, whether they swim or sail from North Africa, walk from eastern Europe or arrive as unescorted children at airports. Even if Australia could theoretically handle the current numbers, there are no grounds for introducing a free for all, possibly encouraging a massive growth of aspirants. The suggestions of this committee report represent a sensible, compassionate outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I take the opportunity to thank the chairman for arranging a fairly strenuous timetable and engineering a final document which represents a sensible compromise in this matter, managing to weld together a number of differing views. I also thank the staff and advisers throughout this inquiry, which has provided Australia with worthwhile information on international practices. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Berowra)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Firstly, let me take this opportunity of endorsing the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations on detention practices, which the House has before it, and the comments of the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson), who spoke before me. I do so as one who has taken a personal interest in refugee and human rights issues over a long period. I do not intend to qualify myself save to say that I have seen refugee situations around the world and have spent quite long periods in Cambodia, unlike, I think, most members of this House. I will return to Cambodia in the next few weeks to try to play a positive role in the reconciliation of some of the disparate political groups in that country to working together.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make those comments because I believe that we have very important obligations in relation to refugees internationally; we have obligations to fellow human beings. We ought to understand that refugees are not just those people who arrive on our shores seeking sanctuary. Refugees exist in a multiplicity of situations around the world, and our obligations are universal. In the earlier report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's refugee and humanitarian system: achieving a balance between control and entry</EMPHASIS> one will find a full outline of our humanitarian responses and the need to ensure that Australia's ability to help those in real need is not compromised by allowing those people who want to exploit our compassion mischievously to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that we do accept obligations. We have signed a number of treaties. When people arrive at our shores and say that they are refugees, they are asylum seekers; they are not refugees. They are not refugees until somebody has actually sat down with them, heard their claims, assessed them and made a decision as to whether or not they are entitled to our protection. At that point in time a person may or may not be a refugee. We have quite developed systems for assessing those claims. This is not to say that there have not been shortcomings in the past, particularly in relation to the processing of some of the claims regarding the Khmer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to create a discordant note regarding the consideration of this report by saying that if it were a broader debate today I would be still very critical of the government's handling of these matters over time. I would be very critical of the fact that people have been held in detention for as long as they have, without their claims finally determined. That is a sorry part of our record. I would be critical of the application of resources to the task and, I think, the unwillingness of people to grapple with the situation of the Khmer, for sometimes the best of reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think many people did not want to see Khmer cases assessed quickly in the beginning because they did not want to develop to a point where they knew their cases would be rejected because they were not going to satisfy the internationally accepted definitions that would enable them to have refugee status. They thought that if they were sent back at the time the Khmer Rouge were very active that could create political difficulties. People in government went slowly in relation to the assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there were others, who also had other agendas, advising and counselling those who were held. A part of that agenda&mdash;and I do not criticise people for doing it, but as a lawyer I know that my profession is wont to do that when acting for clients&mdash;is that they take advantage of every legal opportunity that exists for their clients and, if that means pursuing further appeals even though the case might be fairly light, they will take those opportunities. So we saw a situation in which every one of us was concerned that people had been held in detention for as long as they had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report separates those issues and looks at the question dispassionately. It is a report that is unanimous, save and except for the comments of Senator Cooney in relation to some particular questions relating to judicial review and the dissenting report of the person who asked for this matter to be investigated by a parliamentary committee. When the committee looked at the matter it came to a unanimous view, save and except for her. She opposed it, she did not accept that judgment and added her dissenting report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rationale for detention is clear and is set out on page 11 of the report, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fundamental legal principle, accepted in Australian law and in international law, that, as a natural incidence of Australia's national sovereignty, the State determines which non-citizens can gain entry to Australia, the conditions under which such non-citizens are admitted or permitted to remain, and the conditions under which they may be deported or removed.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the courts have looked at the very question of detention. It is proper within the context of our law. We looked at the questions of our international obligations. I encourage honourable members to look at page 53 onwards. The principal convention is the convention dealing with refugees and the protocols relating to that. Specifically, the refugee convention authorises detention to carry out certain tasks to determine whether or not people have valid claims. It sets out the basis upon which they ought to be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People have tried to introduce questions relating to other treaties and, in fact, the committee looked at this but the Attorney-General's advice in relation to all of those matters quite clearly stated that administrative detention of itself is not prohibited under international law and that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . detention of individuals who enter Australia without authorisation, including asylum seekers, is permissible both under international law and those non-binding international authorities and instruments which are morally and politically persuasive.</PARA>
<PARA>I think they are very important points to be made. My colleague who spoke before me, the honourable member for Reid, mentioned the situation in relation to overseas experience. I do not want to go into any detail in relation to those matters, save to introduce two elements. We were encouraged to look at the United States experience in particular. But those people who encouraged us to look at it had not themselves examined what was happening in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, they were not aware of the comprehensive requirements needed to satisfy the US before release was undertaken. We ascertained that most of the people who were released in the United States were the same people as we release in Australia under surety, those illegal entrants who are detained, have further claims to be made, have some support in Australia and are released under our law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of people&mdash;particularly the Chinese students, about which one could say a great deal but which is not for this debate&mdash;who came into Australia with a valid entry permit but who sought later to make a claim for refugee status and that claim was rejected go on and appeal, as they are entitled to do. A number of them leave Australia. But what alarms me in particular is that in the information contained in the report, of the very large number of people&mdash;about 8,000&mdash;who were surveyed, more than 27 per cent, that is 2,171 persons, did not appeal, did not depart, did not make any further application but remained in Australia unlawfully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of those people who have arrived by boat and whom we now detain under our existing system of assessing claims, which is not being criticised, are unlikely to succeed and have been shown to be unlikely to succeed. If we simply process their claims and release them into the community, judging by the experience of those who were in less pressing circumstances, a large proportion of them would have elected to remain unlawfully in Australia. I suspect that would be our experience in relation to boat people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very disappointed by Senator Chamarette's dissenting report&mdash;I do not wish to give it greater moment than I think it deserves&mdash;because she asked for this reference and then did not accept the judgment of her peers. She persists in using characterisation of detention, which I think is quite unjustified, that we are treating those people who arrive on our shores `in a harsher way than most major criminals, and without court supervision'. I think statements like that do her no justice. They were certainly not sustained by our inquiry. It serves to show how superficial her examination of this issue has been and how those who have sought to rely on it as a basis for criticising this report do themselves and their own independent and impartial abilities to make judgments a great deal of harm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to conclude by saying, as the honourable member for Reid did, how much I appreciate the support of my colleagues on the committee and, in particular, the support of the staff&mdash;Andres Lomp and his colleagues, particularly Kathryn Cronin, who gives up so much of her time from academia to assist us in our work. I thank the House for the courtesy of allowing me to speak on this matter. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CH4">Mr HOLDING</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Melbourne Ports)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I support the recommendations made in the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Asylum, border control and detention</EMPHASIS>. Those groups that are now vocally criticising aspects of this report should look to the history of Australia and our attitude towards refugees. I believe that that is a record, irrespective of who is in power and in government, of which all Australians can be proud. A large number of people are seeking to enter Australia as refugees. The committee had to deal with the difficulty that confronted the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) and his department in dealing with that justly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It always has to be remembered that those who choose to come to Australia without any attempt to have their claims for refugee status processed through embassies and our overseas missions take that position themselves. When they arrive on our shores the pressure on the department and upon the Australian taxpayer is quite immense, because they have to be properly examined to see whether or not their case is bona fide. To the extent to which Australia has both a moral and an international duty to provide proper support to the genuine refugee, every applicant who takes up the time of our structures at the cost of the taxpayer by making claims which will not stand proper investigation is doing a grave injustice to bona fide refugees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The claim that those seeking refugee status are housed in circumstances less than those which exist in our prisons simply indicates that, unlike perhaps some members of the committee, Senator Chamarette has never visited some of our prisons and never seen the conditions that operate there. I do not believe these applicants for assessment should be treated at the same level as a convicted criminal, but they are not. When we visited the detention centres we saw that they had three reasonable meals a day, there was health and medical supervision and there were educational facilities for children. All of those, if we apply a high enough standard, could be regarded as less than adequate, but to what extent is the Australian government under a duty to provide maximum facilities?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, on the basis of the evidence that was before the committee, if we simply release people who come here seeking refugee status&mdash;a large number of them are not bone fide refugees in terms of the international convention&mdash;we are doing a grave disservice, not only to our own immigration standards and policies but also to the bone fide refugees who in various parts of the world are seeking admission to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand the arguments put relating to humanitarianism, but the reality is that we know&mdash;it cannot be denied&mdash;that the refugee claims of many people, either boat people or others, having arrived here and overstayed or with a tourist visa, will not stand examination. Therefore we have to balance the need to preserve and protect the standards set down by the government and by this parliament in terms of our immigration processes with trying to deal justly and humanely with those who arrive on our shores. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Simply turning them loose into the community means that a very significant proportion is going to disappear. Again, it is a problem for immigration officers, when we already have a large number of illegal immigrants. I believe the recommendations in the report are balanced. The report comes from a very proper examination of the evidence and I do not have any difficulty in supporting the recommendations and commending them to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I support the three colleagues of this House from the Joint Standing Committee on Migration who have spoken on the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Asylum, border control and detention</EMPHASIS>. In relation to our refugee program and this detention aspect, which is the subject of the report, it is important to put the whole of the migration program into a context where we look at the various elements. I refer those who have an interest to the initial table, 2.1, on page 9 of the printed report. From that we get some understanding of the extent to which, while the number of persons entering Australia under normal migration outcomes&mdash;that is, family migration, skill migration and special eligibility&mdash;is declining, the number of those entering under the humanitarian program is increasing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the general perspective of the balance of the program, if we provide&mdash;as the two who made minority recommendations; one with respect to the rights of appeal and the other, on a more general basis&mdash;a right of release, we would be, in my view, further adding to the distortions which concern me greatly for a country which remains a net migrant taker. It is of great concern that we do not just look at detention as a humanitarian program which is there in some way to penalise people who, as one of the minority reports suggests, have not committed a crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To start with, detention of a migrant is different from detention of a person within a gaol. While some claimant refugees have been detained in Roebourne gaol for a brief period, the circumstances are quite different. There is no doubt that, although the conditions in the detention centres are not as good as some would like, they are still not gaols. The significant difference is, I guess, that there is no restriction on visitors; there is no restriction on the use of a telephone; there is no restriction on the receipt of goods from outside&mdash;other than, I guess, in terms of ordinary security; and, the people who are detained are able to leave that detention centre at any time, should they be prepared to return to their own country. The first thing I wanted to say in my few brief remarks is that I am of a mind that, unless a nation like Australia maintains, in a humane way, a detention program, there is no real equity between the several categories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But against that, there are two elements. It is essential that applications for refugee status are processed as expeditiously as possible&mdash;and there is reference to that within this report. There have been problems in the past in a number of instances. There is little doubt that people have been detained for unnecessarily long periods. This was due, in part, firstly, to the number of people who arrived and, consequently, the difficulties in processing those applications; secondly, the first boat people arrived more or less at the same time and there was difficulty in ensuring equitable dealing with each of the applications; thirdly, in some instances, which is what occurred with one particular boat load which the committee saw in Darwin, they try to put all the applications in at once; and, fourthly, there were obvious difficulties in ensuring adequate translation facilities. I think that those matters have been addressed. In any event, they are matters to which I believe the government must give attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also recognise within the committee the obvious problems if people are detained for an excess period. A recommendation in the report relates to that. Essentially, the report is designed to try to blend what we would see as a proper and humane treatment of people who are detained with the proper maintenance of a migration policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one real general comment that I want to make is that, when we are looking at the detention report, we must not ignore the circumstances existing in our region at this time. Given the fairly tight procedures being applied in other countries, I would be very apprehensive if we were to relax our detention practices in Australia so that there could be a wave of refugees coming to Australia in a way which would further distort the balance within our overall migration program outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am one of those who see significant advantage in our migration program. I believe that there is certainly an advantage in our increasing the intake of migrants with skills and those in the special eligibility category. I am worried that there would be a flood of refugees if refugees are immediately released into the community, quite apart from the question of whether we would be able to recall them and whether they would be prepared to leave when they were expelled. I think that would be regrettable. In my view, it is important that the elements of the economic and social conditions in our region are taken into account. It is on that basis that I see the recommendations in this report as being the only ones which could be sustained in any reasonable assessment of where Australia should go in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like my colleagues, I would like to extend particular thanks to the secretary and staff of the Standing Committee on Migration. Dr Kathryn Cronin has been a godsend. She seems to know more about migration law than most people in this country, and we are indebted to her for the contribution she makes in ensuring that we do not trip over ourselves through precedents given only a matter often of a week or so before the actual hearing. I commend this report, which I believe is balanced between humanity and rational understanding. I believe that it is a very good solution to what is a very difficult and yet a very important matter of public policy. </PARA>

<PARA>The Olympic Insignia Protection Act 1987 provides protection for what are collectively called the Olympic insignia; namely, the well-known representation of the five interlocking rings and the Olympic motto, citius, altius, fortius, which in translation means faster, higher, stronger. This protection accrues to the benefit of the Australian Olympic Committee, AOC, formerly known as the Australian Olympic Federation, by providing it with a means to derive income by licensing the use of the insignia and of up to 10 associated registered Olympic designs, which are created by the act for this specific purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable members would no doubt be aware, the participation in, and the hosting of, an Olympic Games is an extremely expensive undertaking. As the host nation for the year 2000 games, Australia will be expending considerable sums over the next seven years on the provision of infrastructure, facilities and organisation for this major event. Events of the magnitude of the Olympic Games provide unparalleled business opportunities for the marketing of products and services. Official Olympic Games sponsors recognise these opportunities and are willing to pay considerable licence fees to the AOC for the rights to take advantage of these opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, at times like these there are always free riders who wish to exploit the available opportunities without making any contribution. These are the businesses and organisations which indulge in what is commonly called ambush marketing, an activity that was certainly rife in Australia around the time of the Barcelona Olympics, and, to a lesser extent, at the time of the Albertville winter Olympics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AOC, on behalf of the International Olympic Committee, is naturally concerned that as much as possible should be done to strengthen the protection afforded under the act to the Olympic insignia against this unauthorised commercial exploitation. This would have a twofold benefit. Firstly, it would protect the revenue base of the AOC, the body charged with overseeing Australia's participation in the Olympic Games, and secondly, and perhaps more importantly, it would ensure that Australia is in a position to assure the International Olympic Committee that Australian law gives effect, to as full an extent as possible, to the obligations of the Olympic charter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now briefly detail the legislative changes made by the Olympic Insignia Protection Amendment Bill. The most technical change made amends all references in the act to the federation to refer instead to the committee, as in 1990 the Australian Olympic Federation changed its name to the Australian Olympic Committee, or the AOC. Another very minor amendment to the fee setting provisions of the act will ensure that the application fees for registering designs under the act, and for extending their protection periods, remain pegged to the corresponding fees in the Designs Act 1906. The remaining amendments are more substantial and relate directly to the issues of protection, which I have already outlined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act currently provides that the Registrar of Trade Marks must not register a trademark which comprises or contains the Olympic motto or words very similar to the motto. As I stated before, the motto is the Latin citius, altius, fortius. The bill extends this prohibition on the registration to the English translation of the motto&mdash;faster, higher, stronger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I referred earlier to the provision made in the act for the registration of up to 10 Olympic designs. These designs, and the five interlocking rings, are designs in which the AOC has a monopoly and can license. This allows the AOC or the holder of a licence in relation to a protected design to take legal action if the monopoly in the design is infringed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill seeks to provide protection in much the same way for designs of the Olympic torch and flame. A new design of the torch and flame is commissioned for each Olympic Games&mdash;both winter and summer. So, in terms of commercial advantage to the AOC, protection of these designs is required only for a limited period leading up to and following each games. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The protection period proposed is from the beginning of three calendar years before the year of the particular games to the end of the year of that games. This provides a maximum protection period of four years for any particular design and, because of the structuring of the time periods, minimises the potential for confusion.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is because there will only ever be a maximum of two designs for the Olympic torch and flame for which designs can be registered at the one time&mdash;one winter games design and one summer games design&mdash;and the overlap period will never exceed one year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The designs for the Olympic torch and flame will be included in the maximum of 10 registered designs allowed by the act currently, as it ensures that when the AOC no longer has a use for a logo or design it will pass into the public domain. There will be no provision for extending the period of protection for registered designs of the torch and flame, but it will be possible for the AOC to apply to have the protection period reduced if more commercial benefit could be gained from registering other designs as part of the `portfolio' of 10. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that we are all aware of the existence of trademarks, brand names and business names which have been operating for many years using the word `Olympic', or some or all of the words comprised in the English translation of the motto, or indeed a representation of what could be an Olympic torch or flame. As there is no intention to acquire the rights which have accrued, both at common law and in these registrations, or affect existing rights in any way, the bill clearly provides for the preservation of existing rights. This includes any rights in the torch or flame which may have accrued to persons under the related legislative provisions of the Designs Act 1906 or the Trade Marks Act 1955 up to the time of the gazettal of the statutory rules prescribing the particular torch and flame design. Gazettal will take place no more than six months before the commencement of the relevant protection period. This will limit the period in which common law rights, if any, might accrue in relation to the use of the Olympic torch and flame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, in recognition of the seriousness of the need for protection against unauthorised commercial exploitation, the bill takes the unusual step of referring potential infringers to the remedies which are available under the Trade Practices Act against organisations whose conduct is misleading and deceptive and which make false representations as to sponsorship, affiliation or approval. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take this opportunity to urge the AOC, as the body charged with responsibility for raising funds for participation in the Olympic Games, to make optimum use of the Olympic Insignia Protection Act 1987, as amended. I would also like to remind the AOC of the value and potential for use of other existing industrial and intellectual property legislative regimes which, after all, are also designed to provide a degree of market exclusivity and therefore protection. A detailed explanation of the changes made by the bill is contained in the explanatory memorandum. The changes brought about by the bill require no net additional expenditure. I commend this bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition supports the Olympic Insignia Protection Amendment Bill 1993. By way of background, in 1990 the Australian Olympic Federation changed its name to the Australian Olympic Committee. This bill amends references to this organisation in the Olympic Insignia Protection Act 1987. Of more importance are the changes to the protection offered by the bill against so-called ambush marketing. According to media reports, there were instances of products which illegally used the Olympic logo being sold shortly after Sydney was announced as the host city for the 2000 Olympics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Problems seem to be associated mainly with the detection of offenders, with media reports that the committee had hired private detectives to assist as the police were not interested because no criminal offence was being committed. The bill does not address these practical problems but does widen the range of designs which will be protected and attempts to defer potential offenders by directing their attention to the remedies available against them under the Trade Practices Act 1974. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Neither the act nor the bill attempts to prohibit the use of the words `Olympic' or `Olympiad'. According to media reports, calls have been made by the AOC and the Sydney organising committee for such a prohibition. The government, however, believes that the existing use of these words as trademarks, brand names and business names should not be affected. That was referred to in the second reading speech in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government decision not to attempt to prohibit the use of these words should also be seen in the light of the High Court decision in Davies and others v. Commonwealth of Australia and another 1988. In this case, a provision of the Australian Bicentennial Authority Act 1980, which purported to prohibit the use of a number of words and expressions, was challenged. The court unanimously found that the use of the expression in dispute, `200 years', could not be validly restricted by the act. The court held that the expression was a common one which did not distinguish any particular goods and services. It could therefore not be supported by the trademarks power of the constitution, nor could any other head of power support it. The court did not determine the validity of other words purported to be restricted as to usage by the act, but it is possible that an attempt to restrict the use of the word `Olympic' could also be successfully challenged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the bill is to amend the Olympic Insignia Protection Act 1987 to provide increased protection against unauthorised commercial exploitation of the Olympic insignia. The Australian Olympic Committee has been endeavouring for some time to provide far greater protection for the words `Olympic' and `Olympiad' but without success. The AOC is of the view that, until this is addressed, ambush marketing, as it is known, will continue. The AOC does not say that there is anything wrong with companies gaining commercial advantage per se but, if they are going to use the property of the AOC and the IOM, they should provide appropriate payment, which would then contribute to the development and participation of the Olympic team and various programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Lindsay) referred to the use of other intellectual property avenues. It is my clear understanding that, in that regard, there have been innumerable and ongoing discussions between the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the New South Wales Premier's Department, the Attorney-General's Department, the office of intellectual property and other organisations to try to sort out some of those other possibilities and the problems associated with them. I am not too sure whether the parliamentary secretary is aware of anything that happened at the recent COAG meeting, where I believe there were going to be some discussions. I have not heard the outcome of anything that may have been raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main provisions of the bill are as follows. Clause 3 of the bill amends the definition of the act. Several definitions are extended, bringing under the protection of the bill, firstly, the Olympic motto expressed in English as `faster, higher, stronger' and, secondly, a registered torch and flame design. The protection period for a registered torch and flame design for a particular summer or winter Olympic Games will be the period starting when the design is registered or on the 1 January date that is at least three years but less than four years before the opening of those games, whichever is the later. The protection period ends on 30 December after the closing of those Olympic Games. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill proposes a definition of `Olympic artistic work', which includes a prescribed Olympic torch and flame design under proposed section 2A, or an artistic work that incorporates either the Olympic symbol or a prescribed torch and flame design. Clause 4 inserts a proposed new section 2A, which allows for the prescription of a single artistic work of an Olympic torch and flame for a particular Olympic Games. Such a regulation may be made only where the committee is the owner of the copyright of the relevant work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 5 proposes the repeal and replacement of section 6 of the act, which deals with the ownership of the Olympic symbol. The committee is taken to be the owner of the design of the symbol and any design registered under the act before the commencement of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 6 proposes to add subsection 8(9), which provides in relation to an infringement of the monopoly in a protected design that a design may be a fraudulent or obvious imitation of a registered torch and flame design even if it does not incorporate a prescribed Olympic torch and flame. Clause 7 proposes to insert a new section 9A. The section provides that remedies under the act are in addition to those provided by the TPA. The section is designed to draw attention to the TPA remedies, especially those relating to misrepresentations about sponsorship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 10 proposes to insert a new section 11A, which requires the registrar, on application from the committee, to reduce the protection period of a registered torch and flame design. Clauses 8, 9, 11, 12, 13 and 14 propose minor technical changes and consequential amendments relating to the proposed addition to the act of a registered flame and torch design. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 15 proposes to amend section 20, which preserves existing rights conferred by the Trade Marks Act 1955 and the Designs Act 1906. Subsection 20(2) provides that the act does not affect the use of a symbol on or after a relevant date, where before this date a person would have been entitled to prevent another person from passing off goods or services as those of the first mentioned person. The relevant date is inserted by proposed subsection 20(2A) and is each of the dates of commencement of the act and the bill and the date of registration of a registered torch and flame design. Clause 16 provides that further amendments are contained in the schedule. As I said before, these replace all references to the `federation' with `committee'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned earlier that considerable discussions have been taking place at a very senior level concerning proposals to develop the protection of the words surrounding the Olympics and other matters. It is important in that context for the government to ensure that the competing interests of those who are involved in this matter do not let it become a matter of sports politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is extremely concerned that there be appropriate protection for the bodies that have interests in this matter. We are extremely mindful of the position faced by the AOC to provide significant and proper recognition for what is, after all, its design and to ensure that it is able to maximise the financial benefits that flow from it. At the same time, we are appreciative of the fact that other groups also have an interest in the words.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to speak briefly on a matter that is of great concern to the coalition. It relates to the question of the ongoing conduct of not only the Olympic program but also the sports program in government. My friend and colleague the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), who was very eloquent in his praise of my bipartisan approach to this matter yesterday, might throw me to the lions for these comments. I am extremely concerned about the proposals and the ministerial arrangements announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) following the resignation of the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) as Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. There appears to be great concern amongst the sporting community as to who has the conduct of the sports policy. Considering the extraordinary workload of Senator Richardson, I fail to see how he can possibly devote the requisite amount of time to the portfolio. </PARA>

Senator Faulkner, with whom I served on the Library Committee in this place, is relatively new to the portfolio. Without in any way detracting from his abilities, which I am sure are numerous, it is my understanding that he is already the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and Manager of Government Business in the Senate. On anyone's reading, they are quite significant commitments.

I am not referring to the likes of me or the parliamentary secretary; I am referring to the young people of Australia, whom we should be representing in this country and in this place.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we have heard from previous speakers, the scope of the Olympic Insignia Protection Amendment Bill is rather limited. Mr Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence&mdash;and I am sure the shadow minister for youth, sport and recreation, the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson), will have no objection&mdash;I will widen my remarks beyond the essential scope of this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill offers some important elements of protection against so-called ambush marketing. We saw no better instance of such marketing than at the time of the announcement on 23 September last year of the successful bid for the 2000 Olympics. I was overseas on government business at the time. When those scenes of euphoria, including the celebrations at the Rocks and Darling Harbour in particular, were shown on television screens throughout the world one could not help noticing that some lurk merchants were quick to take advantage of the situation with particular merchandise. Obviously, any major logo is and should be subject to appropriate protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the privilege of serving as a government member on the board of the Australian Bicentennial Authority from about May 1983 to about April 1989. From that experience, I am aware of the issues relating to the protection of important logos, such as the one used at the time, and the opportunities for unscrupulous people to take advantage of the situation. Obviously, one of the major elements of this bill has quite profound implications for protection against ambush marketing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> records of the debates in the House, I noticed that in October last year the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) moved a motion commending the various levels of government for their success in gaining the 2000 Olympics for Sydney. As the shadow minister has pointed out, the Olympics Games are going to be held in the city of Sydney but they should be viewed as an Australian event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Reid referred to the probable impact of the games on the municipality of Auburn in his electorate. He noted that the Homebush site, as a non-rateable area, would mean the loss of some $6.5 million in rates in Auburn between now and the year 2000. I know from my ministerial experience as the minister for local government the significance of that particular sum to the budgeting and accounting procedures for local authorities. This forgone revenue would obviously seriously affect the provision of important local services to the area. In debating his motion the honourable member for Reid called on the state government in particular, but also the federal authorities, to recognise this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He noted also that the unemployment rate within the division of Reid, and particularly the Auburn area, had reached 25 per cent. He said that this very high level of joblessness would clearly need to be addressed in the lead-up to the Olympics in the year 2000. I noticed also that he referred to the need to source a significant amount of infrastructure materials in Australia and with local building companies. These are sentiments that I am sure would be shared by all honourable members in this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that these twin effects on the municipality of Auburn, which lies at the very heart of the site of the year 2000 Olympic Games, provide an important pointer to broader issues which will affect the whole of the state of New South Wales and, to a lesser extent, the whole nation. The issues to which I particularly refer are, first, the need to ensure that the range of public infrastructure and services which the community reasonably expects to be provided continues to be provided at acceptable levels and standards in the years leading up to the games. In other words, that public works spending is not diverted from other areas of the budget&mdash;such as schools, transport, health or elsewhere within the same portfolio; I have a particular interest in country roads&mdash;to road projects around the Olympic sites. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is an important issue to raise. I will cite one instance. Since 1990, when the Premiers Conference by agreement decided that from this particular year road funding to the states would be untied, there have been opportunities for state governments to divert resources. We all accept that governments from time to time do come under significant pressures and, as someone once commented, `The urgent always replaces the important issue'. In that sense, as the games  creep up on us, the temptations for state governments to do this sort of thing will clearly increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there is the need to ensure that, to the greatest possible extent, Australian companies and Australian products are used at all stages in the preparations for the year 2000 Olympics and in all services and products available for sale prior to and during the games. Nothing would offend me more&mdash;as well as, I hope, a lot of other members in this House and I am sure the general public&mdash;than to buy merchandise that clearly was aimed at highlighting the profile of the year 2000 Olympic Games and see that it was made in another country. I believe these are important points which deserve to be considered in association with today's debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the outset, the Olympic Insignia Protection Amendment Bill touches on such issues in only a small way, in that it amends the Olympic Insignia Protection Act 1987 to extend copyright protection to the Olympic motto and to the torch and flame design. The act's very existence and the fact that we are taking the care here today to amend it in this way provides strong support for the wider principle that we should take great care to protect those matters intimately related to the successful staging of the games to ensure that this wonderful opportunity, which the honourable member for Ballarat highlighted, yields the greatest good for Australia as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been rightly said that such matters are, first and foremost, the responsibility of the government of New South Wales which, along with the city of Sydney, is primarily responsible for the organisation and the staging of the 2000 Olympics. Indeed, the state legislation which has been passed in order to establish the Sydney organising committee for the Olympic Games includes a provision that the committee in its dealings will:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . use its best endeavours to ensure that preference is given to the use of Australian goods, services and materials.</PARA>
<PARA>However, that should not prevent the Commonwealth from doing everything in its power to ensure that similar principles are upheld throughout the nation. Indeed, I believe we should be doing just that. I fully support a resolution that was the subject of some debate within my own party branch in Bathurst which, in part, urged:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . legislation be passed regarding the making in Australia of souvenirs and everything that is used or sold in Australia in relation to the Olympic Games in the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA>The benefits of doing so should not be understated, given the estimates that are already available for the impact of the games on the national economy. For instance, KPMG Peat Marwick has estimated that the Olympics are likely to create 156,000 jobs and inject some $7 billion into the national economy between 1991 and 2004. Sydney is expected to benefit from at least half of that amount of money, with the rest being spread throughout other parts of New South Wales and Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend to the House the comments of the shadow minister when he raised the issue of the impact of tourism. There are areas immediately adjacent to the Sydney metropolitan area that I am sure will provide opportunities for great day trips for many of our visitors, both in the lead-up and in the period subsequent to the Olympic Games. As we are a long haul destination for international travellers, many people who come to this country either prior to or after the Olympic Games will take the opportunity to visit many of our major attractions throughout this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just the games for Sydney. It is the games for North Queensland. It is the games for other capital cities throughout Australia. It is the games for the benefit of our great wilderness areas such as Kakadu National Park, parts of Tasmania and many other areas of Australia. I know that, as the member for an electorate less than three hours drive from Sydney&mdash;it is less than three hours drive, as I have alluded to in this House before, as a result of $120 million worth of funds poured into the upgrade of the Great Western Highway through the national arterials and provincial cities and rural highways programs&mdash;the cities and towns throughout the electorate of Calare are already planning to ensure that they receive an appropriate slice of the action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should not forget the federal government's contribution to the games' bid and our continuing contribution to a successful staging of the games. This government contributed $5 million of the $24 million that it cost to stage Sydney's bid, making us one of the biggest contributors. We have already contributed $150 million to the New South Wales government to assist in the development of the games facilities themselves. I do not regard that as a cost to government. That, to me, is money well spent. It is an investment in sporting and tourism infrastructure that will benefit not only Sydney but the nation as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has also assured the House that the Commonwealth will continue to work cooperatively with the government of New South Wales in the many things that need to be done between now and the year 2000.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the disagreeable characteristics of our people is a capacity for not being very respectful of other people's property rights. The legal right of the Olympic symbols is to be held by the Australian Olympic Committee, and so it should. This body has very large expenses which will be incurred on behalf of the Australian people. The Olympic Committee is not a private company looking for a profit. The revenue of the committee comes substantially from licensing agreements involving Olympic insignia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The property rights of the logo, slogan and trademark of the Australian Olympic Committee must be protected from slick operators who, if given a chance, would misuse them to the detriment of the Australian people. Whilst talking about this matter, I would like to remind the Australian Olympic Committee that it has a duty to all Australians to see that these games in Sydney are organised in such a fashion as to be available, both in price and actual fair access of tickets, to ordinary Australians. I accept and welcome the fact that a very large number of foreigners will be coming to Australia and will need to buy tickets several years in advance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Olympics are an international event and the influx of foreign visitors is a wonderful event for Australia. I would suggest that the ticketing arrangements include a lottery system open to all Australians who, by winning a number, have the option to buy a limited number of seats to any event as well as the conventional ticket sale system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some events have a lot of elimination games. Basketball and soccer are two that spring to mind. Perhaps these elimination games, which I notice were played to basically empty stadiums in Barcelona, can be weighted in favour of ticket sales for Australian school students. The young should not be excluded, either by price or access, from the purchase of tickets. It is in our national interest for every event televised around the world to be played before packed stadiums of enthusiastic spectators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our record for producing excellent public events is very good. We know this, but the Olympics give us an opportunity to show the world that we can do a big job if it is given to us. Part of doing this job is the maintenance of proper, balanced finances. It includes access to events for broadcast to the broadest possible spectrum of Australians. It includes a special easy visa requirement for Olympic visitors. This requirement must not be such that visitors are excluded until virtually the games start and are hunted out like dingos the day after the games are finished. Sadly, we have a situation with visas in this country where many people find great difficulty in showing the flexibility that is sometimes needed. I call upon the government to look at the proper formation of visas for the Olympic games. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must make no mistakes about this field; no restrictive rules and insensitive rulings that will mar our greatest opportunity to show the world that we are a serious country capable of running a major event. We do not want a situation where greed spoils people's environment. We do not want shysters draining money away from the Olympic Committee and we do not want overseas guests running the gauntlet of Public Service regulations because their visas cannot be changed from an ABC visa to an XYZ visa because now the Olympics are over and visitors are not just touring Australia. Let us not present to our overseas guests anything other than a very good example of what Australia can produce, particularly on prime time international television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians have a notion that `she'll be right, mate'. This can sometimes be a justification for laziness, both mental and physical. The Olympics will not create themselves. We must do it and we must do it absolutely correctly. There is no room for error, and complacent officials should not be used on this project. These Olympics will be the first impact of Australia for the majority of the world's nations. We have one chance for a favourable first impression. We must not lose this chance by allowing ourselves to be guided by less than useful Australian personnel and national characteristics. I commend this bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>This bill amends the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act 1946 to preclude certain non-citizen children from coming under the guardianship of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. The bill also provides for the `declaring', by gazettal notice, of states and territories once complementary state and territory legislation is enacted. Complementary state and territory legislation will, therefore, be required to provide guardianship care for those non-citizen children who will no longer come under the guardianship of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs upon their entry into Australia for the purposes of adoption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Presently, the act places certain non-citizen children entering Australia under the guardianship of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, principally these being children who enter Australia for adoption, including those children who have been adopted overseas but whose adoption is not recognised in Australia, and children who enter Australia as unaccompanied refugee minors. In relation to children entering Australia for adoption, guardianship powers of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs are immediately delegated to the relevant state or territory welfare administrators by instrument of delegation under subsection 5(1) of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill gives effect, as far as the Commonwealth is able, to an understanding between the Commonwealth, states and territories in 1990 that state and territory governments would amend legislation to enable them to assume guardianship care for those children entering Australia for the purposes of adoption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amended legislation will not preclude the specified children from the guardianship of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs until states and territories have been `declared' by gazettal notice. The bill is premised on the fact that a `declaration' will not be made until the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is satisfied that adequate guardianship coverage exists for all children in all circumstances. The provisions of this bill will not impact the costs of administering the migration program. I commend this bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Colleagues might be grateful to learn that this legislation has the support of the opposition and I will not be calling any divisions on the matter. I understand that in relation to my own responsibilities there seems to be an expectation that that might always be so. The Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Amendment Bill 1993 is non-controversial. We will not be opposing it. It proposes to transfer the guardianship powers of certain non-citizen children from the federal minister to state and territory governments. That does not seem unreasonable, although I hope that cooperative approach is something that the states will recognise has been undertaken by the Commonwealth and that they will build on that in developing appropriate regimes for ensuring that there can be a prompt assessment of overseas countries who are prepared to allow Australians to adopt children in their jurisdictions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Likewise, I hope that the state and territory governments will cooperate readily in developing an effective Commonwealth regime, one which is not fraught with bureaucracy but one which is very much more efficient in ensuring that, where adoptions are desired and where it is in the best interests of children and where the Australian parties who are involved are good and appropriate folk who satisfy the normal criteria here for adoption, we are able to satisfy their needs, recognising that in Australia there is a shortage of children available for adoption and that in many other countries there are possibilities where Australian parents could benefit and likewise young children benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, as I said, in the spirit of cooperation, state and territory governments will be able to assume guardianship when children have been declared by gazettal by the minister, after he is satisfied that state and territory legislation is in place to ensure adequate guardianship arrangements exist on their arrival. It is envisaged that the guardianship powers will be assumed by those state government officials who currently exercise the delegation of the Commonwealth minister, but it will be up to those individual states and territories to determine who under their legislation will assume this role. The bill does provide legislative arrangements to formalise what is, in fact, the current practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the current provisions of the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act 1946, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has guardianship of non-citizen children, including those entering Australia for adoption, and unaccompanied refugee minors. In practice, the minister immediately delegates his powers, as has been said, of guardianship of adoptive non-citizen children to the relevant  state  or  territory  welfare  administrator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been exceptions to this practice, the most noticeable of which being the baby Kajal case when the then minister, Senator Ray, intervened in the state adoption process by exercising his guardianship powers despite his delegation of his role as guardian to the relevant Victorian welfare administrator. The minister, as guardian, ordered the child be returned to prospective parents pending determination of the case. The state government had sought to have the child placed with foster parents in that particular instance. The failure to follow the usual delegatory procedures in the baby Kajal case raises concerns from state governments about interference of federal government in adoption procedures which come essentially under their jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In October 1986 the Council of Social Welfare Ministers and the then Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs made a number of major decisions relating to the Australian inter-country adoption program. One decision was that the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act continue to be used to provide guardianship protection for overseas children adopted by Australians on entering Australia for the purposes of adoption. Since that time the Kajal case has highlighted some of the problems of state and territory officers in exercising the guardianship powers and functions of the federal minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following a review into the federal government's guardianship powers an understanding was reached by the Commonwealth and state governments in 1990. This bill is the legislation by which the federal government will implement this understanding. Complementary legislation will be required by states and territories. There will be a need for ongoing discussions between state and federal governments about details of the complementary state and territory legislation, such as ensuring commonality of definitions such as `permanent resident'. However, these are not part of the objectives of this bill, rather they will be negotiated between the states, territories and the federal government on an individual basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the coalition does support this bill, given the current practice. But I ought to say that having previously held some responsibility as shadow minister for immigration and ethnic affairs I was not comfortable with a lot of the secrecy that is involved in dealing with issues of adoptions. It is perhaps the need for cooperative approaches between the Commonwealth and states, and meetings involving state welfare ministers in the various practices that states seek to put in place, that probably leads to this difficulty in being able to find out a great deal about the practices&mdash;this does give reason for concern from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was an occasion in which Western Australia, for instance, had an inquiry into the question of overseas adoptions. A lot of the difficulty that prompted the former government to undertake this inquiry arose from legitimate concerns flowing from early Australian practices in relation to domestic adoptions involving Aboriginal children where they were, in some cases, removed from their families and placed in foster parent situations within Australia. A whole host of questions arose about the appropriate cultural practices that were pursued in relation to those particular adoptions. The assumption that the culture of the dominant population here in Australia was more appropriate and beneficial is a matter that has been quite seriously contested. These are practices that would not be conducted in Australia today. There is a much greater understanding of the need for children to know a great deal of their background, their family situation and their culture. That is important for their self-esteem in terms of their upbringing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From this has flowed a view, which has troubled me, that it is inappropriate to allow overseas adoptions because behind it there are some assumptions that Australian parents presumably see their culture as, in some way, superior and that they are doing a favour by arranging adoptions, I suppose, for families from overseas that are unable to adequately provide for their children. The view is often put that it would be preferable for those Australian parents who would like to have an overseas adopted child to give funds to aid organisations to satisfy, in some circumstances, their need for a family so the children can continue to be brought up in their home situation. It is almost fantasy to suggest that people who are anxious to adopt a child would in fact give over the moneys that they would otherwise spend on that child to assist families overseas&mdash;as much as I and my own family do spend some of our own resources in assisting children overseas through a number of aid organisations here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is naive to assume that we could increase those funds dramatically by curtailing overseas adoptions here in Australia. Yet, I think that view is seriously put. This legislation is important because it puts beyond argument, I hope, that there is a proper place for inter-country adoptions and that guardianship is an important part of that, and we provide for it legislatively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to raise some concerns in relation to inter-country adoptions generally, because we have seen inter-country adoptions in Australia in quite a significant way since the early 1970s. I understand we have something like 10,000 children who have been adopted from overseas by Australian families. Inter-country adoption is a basis upon which children for whom there is no suitable care in their own country may enter into a family situation here in Australia where the better provision will be made for them in a physical sense and, hopefully, where there will be a caring family environment that will support those children. It is not an easy situation. There are young people who often face the crisis of having been abandoned, relinquished or orphaned and who often face the potential of long-term institutional care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard of quite tragic situations in particular countries, and I do not want to be pejorative in suggesting that in some countries these problems are greater than in others because we know that there are children even in our own country who have been abandoned. In countries that have faced civil war, and in countries that have faced drought, there are often situations where parents cannot provide for their children so they leave them on a hospital doorstep, or sometimes even in rubbish bins around the hospital, in the hope that they might be picked up and some care will be provided to them. That abandonment is common, and the life that that child might face is something that obviously no-one would want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The long-term institutional care in a country that has limited resources and limited capacity to provide that care can be quite difficult. So the concept of inter-country adoption is that life with a loving family is better than an institutional arrangement in any country. This is recognised in the preamble to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that the child, for the full and harmonious development of his or her personality, should grow up in a family environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding.</PARA>
<PARA>Australia does have an excellent reputation for intercountry adoption, largely free of any scandal. Parents are carefully vetted and very often most comprehensively briefed on overseas adoption matters. No approved program in Australia condones or participates in baby trafficking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian governments, through our immigration laws, have ensured that children who come to Australia come only from approved sources. This approval does depend upon satisfying Australian authorities that children are generally available for adoption. I complained earlier&mdash;and I do not resile from that&mdash;about the time that it often takes to undertake those investigations and approvals, the lack of resources to ensure that Australian officials are able to do so and the difficulty that is occasioned when we have to involve a number of governments, state and federal, in that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of organisations in Australia take an interest in these matters. The Australian Intercountry Adoption Network, AICAN, is particularly concerned about the government's lack of response to a Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations report of December 1992. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Dr Theophanous), who is at the table, was the chairman of that committee which inquired into the issue of conditional migrant entry and the health rules. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the parliamentary secretary is taking a degree of credit for this report; I heard him say, `That's right' with a degree of enthusiasm. This inquiry, conducted by members from both sides of the parliament, was undertaken in an unusually cooperative spirit of bipartisanship. But, obviously, now that the parliamentary secretary has joined the executive, he does not seem to have been able to join with his colleagues to give occasion to any sense of urgency in responding to this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may surprise honourable members to note that a section in this report on page 84 deals with intercountry adoptees. The committee received a number of submissions&mdash;one from AICAN and another from another notable organisation, the Australian Society for Intercountry Aid of Children, ASIAC. This organisation said that we ought to take a special approach in adopting children who have some special needs. The organisation said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is at best insensitive, and at worst morally culpable, for Australia to expect to take from relinquishing countries (which are necessarily among the most needy in the world) only the most healthy orphaned or abandoned children, leaving those countries with the sole responsibility for caring for the less healthy children.</PARA>
<PARA>In a submission from a Mr and Mrs Rollings, adoptive parents of a blind Taiwanese boy who was eventually granted entry following appeal to the Immigration Review Tribunal, the theme was continued. They said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We cannot encourage acceptability of people with disabilities within our own community, and at the same time only allow the adoption of perfect blue-ribbon babies from overseas.</PARA>
<PARA>The general thrust of those submissions was accepted by the committee in its recommendations. The committee concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recognising the essentially self-limiting nature of the intercountry adoption program, the Committee was sympathetic towards permitting greater flexibility in interpreting the health rules, to enable consideration to be given to financial and other circumstances which might outweigh the less positive aspects arising from a disability or medical condition. This flexibility should only apply to cases where there is no potential risk to public health, the relevant State welfare authority is satisfied that the intending parents are suited to the task of parenting the particular disabled child, and appropriate guarantees of financial support are provided.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee went on to recommend that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in determining whether to grant an adoption visa or entry permit to a disabled adoptive child who cannot satisfy the health criteria, the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs consider the financial and other family support able to be provided by the adoptive family and the circumstances of the adoptive child, particularly whether these factors could outweigh any likely costs to the community or access to community resources in short supply. In such cases, the entry or stay should be approved only where appropriate guarantees of support can be provided and where the relevant State welfare authorities have approved the intending adoptive parents as capable of parenting the child.</PARA>
<PARA>A numbers of organisations&mdash;and AICAN is one&mdash;are particularly concerned about the government's lack of response to the migration committee's report, and I think justifiably so. Findings of the Australian Government Health Service relating to migrant entry are generally non-appealable, even though other matters can be the subject of appeal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On humanitarian grounds, I think it is proper that the minister ought to be in a position to consider those cases where children suffer some minor health difficulties and parents are able to meet the cost and guarantee to do so. The parliamentary secretary, who introduced the bill, is listed to speak later in the debate. If he does not, he may close the debate. He may be able to give us some assurances on this matter and to tell us how this report has progressed. I am sure that he is across the detail of these matters, having chaired the committee that reported in December 1992. He would not want to let those important recommendations be stood aside through lack of application or attention on the government's part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may surprise honourable members that issues of intercountry adoption can be of such great moment, but a large number of people are concerned about these matters. AICAN has some other concerns, which I think the parliamentary secretary should take on board and raise with his minister. One of them is the lack of efficient consultative measures between the government and non-government bodies in relation to intercountry adoptions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An aspect of great concern to me is that an organisation like AICAN, which has in it people whom I know to be of very considerable reputation, with undoubted capacity and very well informed on these matters, has generally been excluded from the processes in which these matters are considered. I think there ought to be a basis upon which these bodies can be involved. Non-government organisations are generally an intricate part of the administration of intercountry adoptions. They are very often able to offer views on the situation in countries in which they are working. NGOs  involved in the administration of intercountry adoption formed a national network in order to coordinate their views, making it very easy for the government to obtain them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Non-government organisations also offer a valuable resource to the government. They have unique knowledge which, because of their experience in the field over very long periods, is often generally better than the knowledge of administrators from government bodies who, given the basis upon which promotion often occurs in government, are involved in these activities for relatively short periods. If there is mobility in the Public Service, very often there is no institutional knowledge. People have to look up files rather than have any particular understanding of the issues. People involved in non-government organisations tend to have longer periods of interest and, therefore, skill and experience that they can draw upon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure the parliamentary secretary would like to brief the parliament on the way in which AICAN particularly, with its very considerable experience, might be able to be used in a much more positive way by government. I tell the parliamentary secretary that AICAN does believe that completely unsatisfactory decisions are being made, sometimes on the basis of inadequate and inaccurate information because there are inappropriate and ineffective consultative mechanisms in place at this time. That is what it believes and I would hope that the government might address those concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have taken an interest particularly in the very long period of time that it took the government to respond to the willingness of a country such as Ethiopia to allow intercountry adoptions. Senior officers from the department were sent overseas many years ago. Certain reports that ought to have been acted upon were left largely in abeyance and when people got around to considering the matter again, almost a fresh round of visits was required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that troubled me with this matter was that the government of Ethiopia, which was quite prepared to facilitate intercountry adoptions, itself became concerned about the inadequacy of our bureaucracy to respond in a timely fashion and about the extent to which we had to go back over the matter again, with the same questions being asked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We come to a situation such as obtained in Romania. We were all challenged by what happened in Romania and the large number of people who were in institutions, separated from families. People in Australia wanted to respond to those needs. We had newspaper articles such as `A mother's heartbreak: Tasmanian couple flies out to get a Romanian child who may not be let in'. It is a fact that the response from Australia was essentially slow and tardy, yet the response from New Zealand, which does not have the problem of being a federation, was very much quicker. The Tasmanian couple had to look to move to New Zealand so that they could in fact adopt that Romanian child. New Zealand did have an adoption program with Romania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important that this matter not be seen as a backwater in the department. I think it is a matter that requires somebody's taking hold of it and saying, `I'm going to do something about sorting out this problem'. I think it requires the federal minister to provide leadership. I am not suggesting that it should be done in a non-cooperative way, but this matter requires the leadership that comes from being across the issues, understanding them, understanding the motives of the people who are involved and understanding the particular interests of the states, but facilitating the cooperative arrangements. I think people need to be much more open than they have been about the way in which these processes are undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important that organisations that have this experience and background, particularly the non-government organisations, be involved in a proper, consultative way in assisting the government. I believe they are willing. I believe they have the experience and the capacity. I do not believe the people I have met are irresponsible. Very often, they are people who have worked for government in other guises. The name of one of the ladies I know, who is involved in this process and is a leading member of this organisation in a voluntary capacity, appears on substantial reports tabled in this parliament from other government departments. We are not speaking about people who lack credibility, ability or knowledge, yet they seem to be marginalised in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have known numbers of people who have adopted children from overseas. I am aware of the very happy homes they provide and the way in which they work. I know senior ministers in New South Wales who have adopted children. A former member of my own staff adopted a child from Korea. I see that situation on a regular basis. I think it brings considerable benefit to the families involved, who have often suffered emotionally because they have not been able to have children of their own, and it brings very considerable benefit to the children who come into that loving family relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would hope that the prejudices borne out of some very inadequate experiences in this country in the past do not jeopardise a program of this sort. I hope people in government will give it the priority it deserves and that it will not be marginalised because of the government's failure to provide the resources to deal with other difficult questions in the immigration area&mdash;the refugee determination matters that we have addressed at other times, the decision making in relation to Chinese students or whatever. I hope those sorts of issues do not mean that an important question such as this is put to one side because we have other priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the House for giving me an opportunity to put some of the views I hold on this matter and I hope the parliamentary secretary will be able to give a comprehensive brief on the consideration of this report, outstanding now for almost a year and a half, and the implementation of its recommendations. </PARA>

I am sure that, with the activity of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services (Dr Theophanous) and the honourable member's own continued presence and activity on the joint standing committee, these matters can be brought to fruition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I do not want to dwell on what is, essentially, necessary legislation. Amongst the necessary ingredients is a continued preparedness by the state governments to try to ensure that legislation has a degree of uniformity so that we do not have a wide variation of practices around the country in what is, as has been noted earlier, an area that can be very traumatic for the individuals involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we also have to be aware that there should be a balance. It is all right to say that New Zealand may be more expeditious than Australia in these matters, but New Zealand is one country that I would not be too inclined to give much recognition to on immigration practices, as on a variety of fronts they actually constitute a bit of a problem for this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, there is a need for balance there.

There can be attempts to utilise the sentiments and the charity of Australian citizens to subvert, for mercenary purposes, this area of adoption. It is all right to say that there have been protracted delays, that people have not had enough from officers in the field and that it is taking too long. All of that can on occasion be correct.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my pleasure today to speak on the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Amendment Bill. The National and Liberal parties will be supporting the passage of this legislation. The bill precludes children entering Australia for adoption from coming under the guardianship of the Commonwealth Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. Assuming the states and territories enact complementary legislation, such children in the future will come under the guardianship of the relevant state or territory authority. Under current arrangements, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has guardianship of non-citizen children, including those entering Australia for adoption and unaccompanied refugee minors. In practice, the minister immediately delegates his powers of guardianship to the relevant state or territory welfare administrator on the arrival in Australia of adoptive non-citizen children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such practices have not always been followed. The high profile `baby Kajal' case of some years ago revealed the capacity of the federal minister to intervene in the states' supervision of adopted children. Despite having delegated guardianship to the Victorian welfare administrator, the then immigration minister intervened on the basis of his own guardianship powers and ordered that the child be returned to the prospective parents. The Victorian government had sought to have the child placed with foster parents. Surely the conflict between what the Victorian government wanted to do and what the Commonwealth was seeking&mdash;in this case, the minister&mdash;was certainly not in the best interests of the welfare of the child concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aside from the rights and wrongs of the baby Kajal case, the incident did reveal the capacity of the existing legislation to provide for overlapping jurisdictions&mdash;a situation which clearly has the potential to cause confusion and hurt to those closely involved in such cases. Obviously the situation needed remedy. In 1990 the Commonwealth and state governments reached an understanding resolving the overlap of authority, and this legislation effectively implements that understanding. However, the issue of adoptive children from other countries is an emotionally exhausting one. I hope that this legislation will, in some small measure, simplify the process to remove a potential barrier to the coming together of children and their new parents in a very happy environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I sincerely hope that the intention displayed by the government in introducing this legislation carries through to other areas of immigration administration. The introduction of this legislation displays an interest in simplification, in compassion and in reason, which is long overdue. It has been a concern of mine for some time that these qualities were in very short supply within the government and its immigration department. Like most members, I receive countless requests each year to assist constituents with immigration matters. A large proportion simply involve assistance with the filling out of forms and the supply of information. Some, however, seek out assistance when their applications for residency or the extension of visas, whatever the case may be, are rejected. Sadly, some of these applications appear to be soundly based, often resolving a family crisis or reflecting a genuine humanitarian need. But, on a technicality, on a minute administrative detail, they fail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are clearly many applications for permanent or temporary residency that are spurious and that deserve to be knocked back. Such applications are not my concern. However it does concern me that, in seeking to keep out those responsible for spurious and unwarranted applications, we are imposing a regime so inflexible and so stringent that innocent people, with genuine needs and with no hidden agendas, are put through unnecessary trauma and distress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's extraordinary attention to detail with regard to individual cases has unfortunately not always been carried into other immigration related areas. The ill-fated ELICOS scheme, which attracted thousands of people to Australia for short-term language courses, was an unmitigated disaster, largely due to the absence of scrutiny and poor administration. There must surely, somewhere, be middle ground. We should be able to couple the desire to assist those who require residency for genuinely sound or humanitarian reasons with the need to deal hastily with those who do not deserve or require residency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finding that compromise is no small task, and I do not offer a solution on this occasion. I do, however, encourage the government to continue the path it has charted with the legislation before the House today, and to continue to work towards a simplified and flexible approach to immigration matters which would not endanger the integrity of our immigration system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this end, I would like to raise today a recent case in Queensland which was brought to my attention. Fortunately, it seems that this case will be successfully resolved. The constituent in question had requested an extension of a temporary entry visa for a period of three to six months. The circumstances surrounding the need for the extension were tragic. The constituent, an elderly European woman, had arrived in Australia to visit her daughter and son-in-law and their four small children. During her visit, her daughter suddenly died, leaving a distraught husband and four very sad and confused children. The children's grandmother has put aside her own grief for the last few months and cared for the children, allowing the husband time to tidy his affairs in preparation for the day when they will all return to their homeland to rebuild their shattered lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On first inquiring whether her temporary entry visa could be extended, she was verbally informed by an officer of the immigration department that it could be but it would not be. According to the officer, such visas could be extended only if there was a new circumstance requiring the applicant to stay in the country. The officer did not regard the tragic circumstances of this case as reason enough to grant an extension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department acknowledged the children's growing attachment to their grandmother and their obvious need for her love and care but, as the children's need for their grandmother's care had not actually increased, the department could not technically grant an extension. I find that quite amazing. Incidentally, there was no doubt regarding the entire family's desire to leave Australia as soon as possible. The woman had rejected the possibility of applying for permanent residency on the grounds that the whole family would soon depart for their homeland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My office took up this woman's case with the department and stressed the emotional damage that would be wreaked on these young lives if their source of love and support was again taken from them. The department again acknowledged this but suggested the children could be placed in child care if the woman returned to Europe. This suggestion revealed a complete lack of compassion and empathy that I found repulsive. I trust it was an isolated incident which does not reflect on the immigration department as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I approached the minister for immigration in relation to this matter. I sincerely thank Senator Bolkus and his staff for their assistance. The minister was able to ensure that this woman's case was assessed fairly, according to the relevant circumstances. As a result, the woman's visa is likely to be extended and her family will be spared further trauma. This decision was a commonsense and rational one. I again thank the senator and his staff for it. However, it is unfortunate that it took the involvement of several third parties to achieve it. I am sure honourable members could recount similar examples which demonstrate the need to combine a touch of humanity with the abundance of regulation needed to retain the integrity of our immigration system. I do not believe that this is an impossible dream. I urge the government to take up the challenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, as the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) has said, the opposition will be supporting the thrust of this bill. It has been a great pleasure to speak on this bill. I hope that in summing up the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Dr Theophanous) takes on board some of the points that I have raised. I am sure there are other areas in which there needs to be some more flexibility, without compromising the integrity of the immigration system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank those honourable members who have participated in the debate on the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Amendment Bill. As the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) knows, I have been concerned with this matter for a number of years. At one stage it reached the point where I got into open conflict with a state minister in relation to this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the concerns that I had was the ad hoc nature of assessments being made by some state authorities in relation to whether parents were eligible to adopt children from overseas. This legislation is intended to streamline the process. Essentially now it has shifted the full responsibility&mdash;most of which was with the states anyway&mdash;onto the state and territory governments, particularly onto their welfare ministers, to ensure that Australia has a reasonable inter-country adoption system. I will be very interested to see how they meet that responsibility. The Commonwealth's role is now quite small. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, because inter-country adoption is a state and territory welfare matter, it is important that as far as possible states and territories have some uniformity in their approaches to this issue. For example, I know that they are having discussions on the arrangements with specific countries such as Ethiopia, as has been mentioned by the honourable member for Berowra. There is a council of state and territory welfare ministers. At meetings of that council, the ministers work out general approaches in relation to specific countries for the whole of Australia, on a state and territory basis&mdash;to the extent that they can work them out, of course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is to be hoped that as a result of this new cooperative approach we can get rid of bottlenecks and create a situation in which the inter-country adoption process improves dramatically in this country. Given the very sad situations around the world of children languishing in very high poverty level orphanages, a number of countries are quite happy to allow them to be adopted by loving parents in Australia. There is no reason why we should not accommodate that and, as a nation, do whatever we can to make that process work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Berowra said, a very large number of Australian couples would love to be in a position to adopt. If there is need over there and there is need here in Australia, we have to make sure that that need is met, because the overall humanitarian outcome is good for everyone. That does not mean that we should ignore the fact that we have to be cautious in making sure that children are not abused and that the adopting parents are in a position to look after the children and not abuse them. In an overwhelming number of situations, that will be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about couples that either cannot have children or have had one child and want to adopt another child. Within Australia the number of children that are available for adoption is small. So in that sense I think the federal government and the minister ought to be congratulated for streamlining these arrangements so that we can progress this matter. I hope that the state and territory welfare ministers will take their responsibilities in this matter seriously and will help in overcoming the bottlenecks and other problems. I do not know whether the House is aware that there is no immigration quota on inter-country adoption. If these state bodies wanted to meet the needs of these people,  and if the children were available and had been cleared by overseas authorities, they could significantly increase the number of children being adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context it is worth mentioning that an international agreement called the Hague agreement has recently been signed. Australia is considering whether it will become a signatory to that Hague agreement on inter-country adoption. I think that Australia should. We should be able to participate in international forums to ensure that the conditions under which children are given over for adoption within Australia meet all humanitarian concerns and all the concerns of the various governments involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is no reason why we should not, as a consequence of all of these procedures, have in place a much better and more streamlined system which delivers an outcome. I look forward to a situation in which many of those couples in Australia who have been waiting are provided with the great happiness that they deserve from adopting a child from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter that was raised in the debate concerns the response to the conditional migrant entry report. The honourable member for Berowra raised this issue. There has been active dialogue between departments on this matter. As honourable members would know, there are 21 recommendations. As the honourable member for Berowra would be aware, because he was with me on the committee that produced the report, these recommendations and the issues concerned involve complex legal and administrative questions. They also involve a number of government departments and are being studied by an interdepartmental committee. I am reliably informed that a response in the next few months will be forthcoming. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before turning to the Military Compensation Bill, dare I say that I was interested in the passage of that last piece of legislation and hope that inter-country adoption will always involve male and female couples and not couples of the same sex.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset, I want to say how pleased I am to see this military compensation legislation finally before the parliament. The federal coalition will not be opposing the military compensation legislation, however I would like to go over some of the background to this legislation to illustrate how tardy the government has been in finally dealing with this important matter. It now presents us with an additional amendment to the bill which is of passing interest and which we will also support in respect of a member of the Defence Force being detailed in line with the request of the RSL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Issues such as this should not have to be vigorously pursued on a partisan basis. I recognise that over the years the Labor Party has had a record in regard to veterans entitlements and the former minister the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Humphreys) had a great deal to do with the veterans entitlements legislation, its enactment and its implementation. It is a very important area of federal statute in respect of veterans and also serving members of the defence forces. I remind the House of what Ben Chifley as Minister for Post-war Reconstruction once said in the House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The careers of hundreds of thousands of young men have been interrupted and in some instances partially ruined. There is a break of education, training and opportunity which cannot be repaired. It is perfectly true that experience is gained, but that is not material to an ordinary civil vocation. On this parliament rests the responsibility of seeing that the right thing shall be done.</PARA>
<PARA>On a bipartisan basis, I also refer to what former Prime Minister Arthur Fadden, the then Leader of the Australian Country Party, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A grateful nation must see that those who are privileged to return from battle areas shall be properly cared for, and that their reinstatement in civil life shall be wisely and expeditiously carried out.</PARA>
<PARA>Former Prime Minister Menzies and many others, of course, have spoken of that commitment, that responsibility, of the parliament. As today's Leader of the National Party and also as someone who has had military experience of yesteryear, it is my interpretation that that commitment goes not just to the veterans but to our serving personnel who even in the 1990s are often called on to carry out quite dangerous peacekeeping work in places like Somalia, the Sahara, the Middle East, where Australian soldiers are at present, Syria and the Golan Heights. They have a right to have confidence that their parliament will take proper measures in respect of their circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go back over the history of this particular legislation to illustrate the government's tardiness. I well remember the introduction of the Veterans' Entitlements Bill to this parliament in 1985. I spoke on that bill on 12 November and made the point that there would need to be a military compensation act to complement the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The response from the government was that members of Australia's defence forces had cover under workers compensation&mdash;a very risky provision in all the circumstances. In fact, they are currently covered under the Safety Rehabilitation Compensation Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This did not satisfy the coalition or the RSL at the time because there was no recognition of the very different demands placed on members of the defence forces as opposed to other Commonwealth employees. In fact, I said at the time that our position was quite clear cut&mdash;that is, the armed forces should remain under repatriation cover until we saw the full details of a military compensation scheme and the passage of military compensation legislation. That legislation is before the House this day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response, the government, through the then Minister for Veterans' Affairs&mdash;I am talking about 1985&mdash;said that the government was examining the area of military compensation and developing a military compensation package. The result of that examination is before us today. Senator David MacGibbon will deal with this legislation when it gets to the other house. We have considered it in some detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I highlight that it has taken nearly 10 years from the time the Veterans' Entitlements Bill was introduced into the House to finally having the Military Compensation Bill before the parliament. I do not believe that this is satisfactory. I believe that the government stands condemned for the time that it has taken to finally develop a proper military compensation bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now turn to the detail of this legislation. As I have said, the opposition will not oppose this bill. The bill amends the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 and the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 to create a military compensation scheme. The effect of the proposed amendments&mdash;that is, the purpose of the bill&mdash;are worth canvassing. Part 2, covering clauses 3 to 10, establishes the military compensation scheme within the framework of the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, the military compensation scheme will apply to all members of the Defence Force, including members on future operational service, ensuring that members on operational service as well as hazardous and peacekeeping service will have the option of Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act or Veterans' Entitlements Act coverage. Second, ordinary peacetime members who, on the commencement of the military compensation scheme, have an existing entitlement under part 4 of the VEA will continue to have the option of Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act or Veterans' Entitlements Act coverage for that period. Subsequent service will be covered by the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act only. Third, ordinary peacetime members who do not have an existing entitlement under part 4 of the VEA on the commencement of the military compensation scheme or who enter the ADF after commencement will only have Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act coverage as modified for the military compensation scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourth, through section 5(6A), the minister will be able to extend the operation of the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act beyond members of the Defence Force by declaring that the act will apply to those who hold honorary rank when they engage in activities stemming from that rank. An example of this is an honorary colonel of the infantry corps travelling to Somalia, Cambodia or an equivalent future peacekeeping operation. That is quite necessary and satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also included are members of philanthropic organisations, such as members of the Salvation Army and other organisations, which go forward with Australian peacekeeping efforts. They went forward in the Gulf War and made a very thoughtful, powerful and positive contribution to the wellbeing of Australian soldiers. I salute the contribution that those philanthropic organisations, such as the Salvation Army, have made over the decades to Australian troops in all sorts of situations, particularly those ex-members of the ADF who are here on discharge settlement training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifth, while it is possible under certain circumstances to have a choice of coverage, it will not be possible to receive doubling up, overlapping entitlements. Sixth, members of the Defence Force, cadet corps and persons declared under section 5(6A) will be covered for any injury which arises out of medical treatment provided by the Commonwealth where the injury is an unintended consequence of the treatment. Seventh, injured members of the ADF will be able to receive full pay or supplementation up to full pay for the first 45 weeks of compensation regardless of whether they stay in the ADF or separate, as can be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now deal with other parts of the legislation. Eighth, transitional provisions are inserted to ensure that members on operational service do not have dual coverage under the Veterans' Entitlements Act and the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act as surveyed by the military compensation scheme. Ninth, members on hazardous service are to continue to have the choice of Veterans' Entitlements Act coverage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tenth, peacetime members who have an existing period of entitlement under part 4 of the VEA will have the choice of Veterans' Entitlements Act coverage for that period following the commencement of the military compensation scheme. Eleventh, ordinary peacetime members who do not have existing entitlements under the VEA will only have coverage under the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act as modified for the military compensation scheme. Twelfth, a termination date is fixed to remove Veterans' Entitlements Act coverage for ordinary peacetime service except for a period of entitlement already existing at that date. I have stated all this so that the House might be fully cognisant that this military compensation scheme comes in at a critical time to make sure that we do the right thing not only by veterans but by those who are serving in Australia's army, navy and air force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main features of the military compensation scheme provide a basic level of compensation cover for all types of service, including all benefits currently provided under the Superannuation Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. There is coverage for unintended consequences of medical treatment paid for by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is one anomaly that I would appreciate some comment on and response to from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr Punch), who is at the table. He will bring forth an amendment in the consideration of the bill in detail, which we have no argument with, concerning a defence member in relation to the military compensation legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill quite rightly covers unintended consequences. However, unintended consequences may not have been fully covered since 1988. The RSL and others have made submissions which point to the following situation: a member of a defence force who perhaps injures his leg and is compensated for that injury may damage his other leg by the way that he is forced to limp on the first leg and may have to correct his walking style or whatever. I am not being pedantic. I have had recent experience of this and have observed other patients at close hand in a range of circumstances which I would not wish upon anyone. These situations can literally come about through the initial injury and, at a later stage separate to the actual incident, bringing on a consequential injury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That damage to the other leg or other part of the body is an unintended consequence. It has always been covered by compensation except, it would seem, for the period from 1988 until the passage of this bill. I would appreciate it if the parliamentary secretary could fully lay before the House the coverage that exists in respect of this aspect&mdash;I am pleased that he will do that&mdash;and the period that the coverage relates to with particular reference to that critical period between 1988 and the present day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the main feature of the military compensation scheme. As has been mentioned, it covers those declared by the minister to hold honorary rank and other special categories. It provides, in a broad sense, the type of compensation which the coalition feels is most necessary. Therefore, we do not oppose the bill, but we give an assurance to our veterans and, more particularly, our serving navy, army and air force personnel that we will monitor closely the operation of the Military Compensation Act. We will monitor extremely closely its practical application to those who apply for compensation from events which have impacted upon them during their military service to see that fairness and justice applies in practice and that it does not lead to those ex-service personnel and serving personnel somehow becoming derailed in the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an extraordinarily complex area of the law. Over the years, it has been partially tidied up in related areas under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. It is one for which this parliament has the responsibility of seeing in absolute terms that the right thing is done by our veterans and serving personnel. I remind the House that even on this day personnel are serving in several theatres around the world, including the Middle East and the Sahara, with a great deal of personal danger attaching to their honourable work that is being done on behalf of Australia and the world. Therefore, the coalition does not oppose the Military Compensation Bill. However, it seeks the assurance that I have detailed. We will not oppose the particular minor amendment that will be moved by the parliamentary secretary. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also pleased to see that the victims of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> disaster have finally received a measure of compensation and justice. Frankly, honourable members on both sides of the House have at different times borne responsibility for this matter being dragged out for such an inordinately long period. Nevertheless, I think honourable members are pleased with the initiative of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) to bring this matter to a conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Leader of the National Party pointed out, we have serving men and women in peacetime operations not only in Australia. I am very pleased that the members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade have had the opportunity to visit many of these men and women at their places of work. I thank the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) and the ADF for that opportunity. We gained an appreciation of the challenges they face and the equipment they need to operate. As people who are not serving members of the services, we got as close as we could to the challenges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important role that the ADF has in peacekeeping has also been mentioned. I was very privileged to go to Somalia with Senator MacGibbon, the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) and the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell) at the invitation of the Minister for Defence. We saw at first hand just what our forces had to put up with and the hazards that they were faced with. We also saw the tremendous goodwill and good work that they generated through their operations. It is always an advantage for members of parliament to see at first hand the good work of the members of the ADF in peacekeeping. I say frankly to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr Punch) that I know that honourable members on both sides would welcome any further opportunity to visit these peacekeeping operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst we can be rightly proud of the entitlements and coverage that we have provided for our veterans, operating under the Department of Veterans' Affairs, it is true that there has been a significant gap. The military compensation scheme brings the ADF closer to workplace compensation packages. Whilst veterans entitlements try to retain the health of veterans and provide them with permanent pensions, one of the advantages of the military compensation scheme is that it is based more on lump sum compensation and it has a greater emphasis on rehabilitation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to repeat the detail referred to by the Leader of the National Party when explaining this to the House. But, whilst it is really good to see that the scheme has been extended to certain categories of people&mdash;for example, those holding honorary rank, such as colonels of regiments and cadets&mdash;one of the ironies is what happens to members of parliament who may be visiting a peacekeeping operation and suffer an unfortunate injury. Whilst everyone else may be covered under the scheme, no compensation is available for members of parliament. Whilst I do not want to seek to plead self-interest here, I find that rather ironic. Notwithstanding the lack of adequate compensation arrangements, I reiterate that honourable members on both sides are very keen at all times to take up whatever opportunity may exist to see at first hand our serving men and women operating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As this bill has bipartisan support, I am content with making a very modest contribution. I want to congratulate the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Senator Faulkner), the parliamentary secretary and the departments on the consultation process. I am very pleased to see that there is an amendment before the House which provides the opportunity for a serving member of the ADF to serve on the commission. In hindsight, we could probably see this as an omission, but it is always good to see the government, as a result of necessary consultation, picking it up. I commend the government for the process and the outcome. I am sure it will be welcomed by not only the serving men and women of the ADF but also those organisations that seek to represent their interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I strongly feel that some parts of parliamentary activity ought to attract a bipartisan approach. I am very pleased that, on this particular matter in the defence area, we have the support of not only government members but equally importantly opposition members for the proposals being considered by the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), I have a great deal of pleasure in rising this afternoon to provide a very large measure of bipartisan support for this important legislation. I would also like to reinforce one or two of the comments made by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) in his contribution. I pay tribute to one or two people on the other side of the House who have made very large contributions to the veterans affairs and defence personnel areas in the time that I have been in this parliament since 1988. I refer specifically to the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Humphreys) and the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons), both of whom have made very large contributions. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Chifley, made a very substantial contribution in that area in the last parliament. I take the opportunity to acknowledge that this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one person whom the Leader of the National Party forgot to mention in his contribution, and that is the Leader of the National Party himself. In his capacity as shadow minister in previous parliaments, he has made a very substantial contribution to the veterans area. I take the opportunity this afternoon to acknowledge that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As previous speakers have said&mdash;and I will not go over the history of this legislation&mdash;there are four dimensions to the military compensation scheme which are worth reinforcing in the context of this debate. Firstly, the scheme will provide a basic level of cover for all types of service, whether it be peacetime service, peacekeeping service, hazardous and/or operational service. Secondly, it also ensures that all the benefits available under the Safety Rehabilitation Compensation Act 1988 are picked up. Thirdly, as the Leader of the National Party said, the scheme adds some additional benefits, but I will not go into the details of those. Fourthly, those who are injured in operational, hazardous or peacekeeping service have a choice between the military compensation scheme and the Veterans' Entitlements Act provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we recognise all of those. It is also important that we recognise another important aspect of this legislation. Let me say to the House that members of the Australian Defence Force, of which I was very proudly a member for three decades&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Tim Fischer" NAMEID="DG4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OJ4">Mr TAYLOR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much. Members of the Australian Defence Force are not members of the Australian Public Service in uniform. I think it is important that we highlight that fact in the context of debating this legislation. We must not lose sight of the fact that the Defence Force is a unique environment. Where we can, we pick up the provisions that apply to all others in Commonwealth employ but, at the same time, we must recognise the specific environment under which the Defence Force serves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure the President of the RSL will not mind my mentioning that in some correspondence that he had with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Faulkner) in the lead-up to this legislation he made the point that, whilst he thought the military compensation scheme was accepted and it is a political and governmental decision, there were a couple of points he felt he should make. In reference to the Veterans' Entitlements Act, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ex-Service community is still not convinced that an adequate reason exists for establishing a Military Compensation Scheme. We prefer to incorporate appropriate amendments into the Veterans Entitlements Act to ensure that Service Personnel are covered under the VEA at all times during their service. This follows from the principle that during peace Service Personnel train for war and the effectiveness of that training is reflected in either the effectiveness of their deterrence or the effectiveness in war. Other reasons for maintaining coverage under VEA are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a.  <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One Department would administer all compensation and rehabilitation for all Service Personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">b.  <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system is already established. The DVA have 75 years of experience of dealing with injured and ill ex-Service personnel. A national network of officers, medical staff, support systems and liaisons is working effectively and has been modified recently with the change of hospital support systems to be more accessible to the client needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">c.  <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system established at the moment, recognises the unique nature of the Defence Force Service.</PARA>
<PARA>I have just made that point myself. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This was explained by the Government when amendments to Repatriation Legislation were introduced in 1973 to cover peace time service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">d.  <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an obligation to provide the best possible conditions of service to the Defence Force, whereas there is no obligation other than a statement of political intent for an MCS to be established.</PARA>
<PARA>That said, the RSL and other groups have accepted the need for this legislation. The President of the RSL also made the point&mdash;and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr Punch) might cover this in his summing-up&mdash;about the income supplementation provisions not ceasing at age 65. He made one other point which the parliamentary secretary may also like to address. He said in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is accepted that the medical and fitness requirements of the Australian Defence Force are such that a physically incapacitated person may not be able to remain in the Defence Force. However, the obligation of the employer, ie The Commonwealth, to the employee ie The Service Person, should not be forfeited and the commitment in the second reading speech should be honoured in that Service Personnel no longer capable of continuing Service within the Defence Force, should if they are not able to gain employment elsewhere, if that is their desire, should be employed by the Commonwealth or at least have a preference to employment by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA>I understand and recognise that that is a far wider issue but it is something about which the parliamentary secretary might like to make a comment. I will not take up undue time of the House this morning. I am glad that the honourable member for Chifley made mention of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> case. As someone who has been very heavily involved in those compensation cases since 1988, I say to the House that we must never let that sort of thing happen again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not pointing the finger at the present government. I think ministers on both sides of the political fence really have something to answer for in relation to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> saga. I am delighted that the present Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch)&mdash;I pay tribute to him again this morning&mdash;saw that a pragmatic solution was necessary in relation to compensation in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> cases. Whilst undoubtedly that will be expensive for the taxpayers&mdash;perhaps in the region of $30 million to $40 million&mdash;it is at least a small measure of recognition of the psychological and other problems that survivors of that catastrophe, which occurred just over 30 years ago, have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the honourable member for Chifley for raising that matter. I reinforce to the parliamentary secretary and the officials in the chamber this morning the point that we must never let such a thing happen again. We must never again let something drag on for three decades. During that time we saw people take the extreme action of suicide because they were being frustrated by a system and a bureaucracy which was unnecessary and which, in any event, proved to be fruitless. Like honourable members before me, I have much pleasure in supporting this legislation. I look forward to making some further comments in this area as further legislation comes before the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I will respond to a couple of points raised by honourable members opposite. I thank the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) for their contributions and the spirit in which they were made. As the honourable member for Chifley said, it is an outstanding feature of Australian politics that defence matters have bipartisan support in this place and the other place. I think it is incumbent on all of us to work very hard at maintaining that situation, given the national importance of defence at the present time and in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first matter I want to deal with is one raised by the Leader of the National Party. He spoke of an unintended consequence in the form of a consequential injury not being covered in the period from 1988 to the present. The honourable member is correct in saying that there is somewhat of a gap between 1988 and the present legislation. But that gap does not relate to an example such as that given by him in which there is a clear causal link. In other words, if the original injury is a compensatable injury, I am advised that linking it to a second, consequential injury does not present a problem under the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, however&mdash;and the honourable member is correct to raise this matter&mdash;a problem when the original injury is not compensatable. I am advised that the best example of that might be a dental problem. The department is aware of this gap and, as we speak, is working on a formula that will resolve this problem. As I intimated privately to the Leader of the National Party a few moments ago, it may well be that this can be done by administrative means rather than legislative means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Groom raised three points. Firstly, he asked: why the MCS? The government foreshadowed this in 1986 with the introduction of the veterans entitlements legislation. In 1992 the government adopted a very firm view on the policy of an introduction of the MCS. During the development of the MCS, consideration was given to the option of providing the scheme as an amendment under the old veterans entitlement regime. However, this was not adopted for a number of reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will briefly deal with those reasons. Firstly, Defence was already administering the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. As this military compensation scheme was to be based on that, it was logical to retain the administration of the scheme with Defence. It was also important that Defence retained its role as the administrator of this scheme to ensure that Defence fulfils its responsibility as an employer&mdash;a simple employment relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no longer acceptable, in our view, for an employer to injure an employee, as it were, and then take no interest in the rehabilitation of the injured individual. One would hope that we would all agree that should be the case right across the work force but it is particularly the case in terms of our armed forces. A separate MCS administered by Defence brings this employer responsibility into very sharp focus. The MCS will allow the Department of Defence to integrate all the aspects of the important areas, obviously, if they are under the one roof. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other reasons which I will briefly summarise. It has to be said that, while the Department of Veterans' Affairs has a long history of administering veterans benefits, it does not have a great deal of experience in managing the type of rehabilitation and vocational retraining that is the hallmark of modern compensation legislation such as this. The modern rehabilitation and vocational retraining responsibilities are something that we think that Defence is well positioned to do. Much rehabilitation work is, of course, carried out now by the defence forces medical services and through a highly effective system of schools and training courses. All in all on that first point raised by the honourable member for Groom, I think it is simply a case of who is best able to do the job and where the responsibility should lie. They are the two essential points coming out of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member also asked a question that a number of the returned services organisations have asked, and that is: why do the weekly income support payments stop at age 65? He is quite correct to ask that I deal with this question here. I think that is most appropriate. Weekly income support payable under the MCS will stop at age 65 and, of course, all the other benefits continue for life. But, in so assessing it, we have to understand that income support payments payable under most major Australian compensation schemes also finish at age 65. This is the age by which most Australians have left the work force. When they leave the work force, they draw their income from their superannuation or from a government pension. Therefore, they are eligible&mdash;as are other Australians under other schemes&mdash;for other benefits, be they superannuation or government pension. It is, if you like, entirely consistent as a matter of logic with the broader work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final matter that the honourable member for Groom raised was the matter of preference and retaining employment for injured persons. That is also a very good point that he has raised. I might say that, while the honourable member was busy congratulating a number of people in the place on their involvement in defence matters, he probably should have given himself a pat on the back, not to mention his brother as well. He has a very strong family history of very senior and worthwhile military involvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue that the honourable member raises is and will be considered in the rehabilitation process of the individual. The department has advised me that it is doing more work on this. This may be something that we as a government need to monitor to make sure that it is being done right. I have got every confidence that it will be. But I guess that, because the rehabilitation process is under the roof of the Department of Defence&mdash;which was the first point raised by the honourable member&mdash;it yet again highlights the benefit of being in the right place. </PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill proposes amendments to a number of acts administered within the portfolio of the Prime Minister and to other legislation dealing with matters relevant to the Prime Minister's portfolio. Details of the various amendments are set out in the explanatory memorandum which accompanies the bill. I will deal only with the more important aspects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill contains amendments to the Freedom of Information Act 1982 and the Archives Act 1983 relating to access to documents known as cabinet notebooks. The Archives Act will be amended to provide a clear and sensible archival mechanism that, for the first time, will allow public access to notebooks recording the deliberations of cabinet after a period of 50 years. At the same time, cabinet notebooks will be protected from access under the Freedom of Information Act during that period. While these acts do not fall within the portfolio responsibilities of the Prime Minister, the amendments are included in this portfolio bill because of the Prime Minister's responsibility for the cabinet process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members may be aware that, on 16 December 1992, amendments to the Archives Act, the Freedom of Information Act and the Evidence Act were introduced into the House of Representatives in a bill titled the Cabinet Notebooks (Access and Protection) Bill 1922. That bill lapsed on the calling of the last federal election in March. An explanation of the cabinet notetaking system was included in the second reading speech accompanying that bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In April 1993 the High Court handed down its decision in relation to the appeal by the Commonwealth against a decision of the full court of the Federal Court in the case of the Northern Land Council v. Commonwealth in which the council sought access to a number of cabinet notebooks from the 1970s. While not finding that there is an absolute immunity from production of cabinet notebooks in court proceedings, the High Court found that there were `extremely strong' considerations of public policy weighing against their production. Only exceptional circumstances, such as non-disclosure impeding defendants in the conduct of their defence or allegations of serious misconduct on the part of cabinet ministers, should justify disclosure in such proceedings.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of this decision, the government has decided that it is unnecessary at the present time to include provisions regulating the use of cabinet notebooks in court proceedings in the Evidence Act or the proposed evidence bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also implements the government's December 1992 response to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report of the review of the Office of the Ombudsman</EMPHASIS> by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. In line with the recommendations of the standing committee, the major amendments to the act will: give the Ombudsman jurisdiction to investigate administrative actions of Federal Court registries and Commonwealth parliamentary departments; give the Ombudsman a discretion to decline to investigate or to cease investigating commercial activities of Commonwealth agencies; and allow the Ombudsman to transfer complaints to the Australian Broadcasting Authority, the Merit Protection and Review Agency or an industry ombudsman, where appropriate. In addition to the amendments to implement the government's response to the Senate Standing Committee's report, a number of other minor amendments to the Ombudsman Act will be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also includes amendments to the Public Service Act 1992 and the Superannuation Act 1976 to enable effect to be given to the government's decision to allow secretaries to departments and a limited number of equivalent level statutory office holders to relinquish their continuing tenure in the Public Service, and the value which attaches to that tenure, in return for a reasonable loading on their salaries being set by the Remuneration Tribunal. The government has recommended to the tribunal that the loading should be set at 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes we are making are a natural evolution of the changes made 10 years ago when the parliament removed the right to tenure in particular departmental head positions and the policy of rotations on a five-year basis was introduced. Enabling secretaries to departments to choose whether to retain their tenure in the Public Service or to relinquish it in return for a salary loading is a logical progression which has taken place in many other public services both here and overseas. Even with the loading, which will be set by the independent Remuneration Tribunal, the remuneration of Commonwealth heads of departments, with their national level responsibilities, will not match that of their counterparts in Victoria and New South Wales. It should be noted that the government policy of reviewing secretaries' appointments after five years in one position will continue. Secretaries who remain in their current positions will be reviewed at the expiration of five years from the original appointment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In sharpening the focus on the policy of rotation of making greater use of fixed-term appointments, the government will continue to retain the traditional virtues of the Public Service with the emphasis there has always been on having heads of departments with great personal integrity, political impartiality and preparedness to offer the frank and fearless advice we expect of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill includes other amendments of a minor nature to the Public Service Act 1922 to ensure that the act adequately reflects the requirements of contemporary public sector administration. For example, amendments are included relating to the discipline process, excess officers, joint selection committees and the mobility provisions of the act. The discipline process as it relates to unattached officers will be brought more into line with the process that applies in relation to other officers. The amendments reflect the recommendations of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration in December 1992 on its inquiry into the management of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The amendments relating to excess officers will ensure that the appeal mechanism available to excess officers in relation to transfers is only available to those excess officers who have applied for transfer to a position. Other amendments will allow for the use of a joint selection committee order of merit in filling identical and subsequent vacancies.The bill also makes a number of minor or technical amendments to a number of other acts. Details of these are set out in the explanatory memorandum.I commend this bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my introduction I would like to make the point that I find it quite unsatisfactory that we have the explanatory memorandum available to the opposition some days before we have the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr Punch) and yet the second reading speech only takes place as part of the second reading debate. This is one of the new changes that have been introduced to the procedures of this House but I think it should be reviewed. The concept of having the legislation introduced and then the second reading speech take place at that time and then adjourned gives the opposition the considerable advantage of at least being able to read in detail the second reading speech as well as the explanatory memorandum. There are many occasions when the contents are not consistent with each other. To expect anybody to be able to comment on legislation immediately after a speech has been made, especially of this nature, is ludicrous, to say the least.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, the opposition is not opposing this legislation. It is an omnibus bill. It amends a number of acts concerning cabinet notebooks, the Ombudsman's responsibilities, the disciplinary process applying to unattached officers in the Public Service, the remuneration arrangements for departmental secretaries and a number of other minor technical amendments to other acts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most interesting element of this legislation is the handling of cabinet notebooks. This has always been shrouded in some mystery. They are intended to serve as an aide-memoire in the preparation of cabinet minutes by the cabinet secretariat. They are held by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. It is my understanding that they contain the personal views of individual ministers, although the actual vote, if there is a vote, which may take place in the cabinet may not necessarily be so recorded. These notebooks are confidential. They cannot be reproduced or shown to any unauthorised person, and access to the cabinet notebooks is not allowed except on the authority of the Secretary to the Cabinet and is strictly limited to senior officers of the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks back through the history of the Westminster system over recent decades one immediately comes upon the story of the Crossman diaries, which as I understand it was the first time that a cabinet minister in our system had actually released a book, an autobiography, which contained a substantial amount of information which he had obviously gleaned from his own diaries kept of cabinet meetings and their outcome. That caused at the time quite some irritation both amongst his ex-colleagues and the bureaucrats as to what the actual standing of notebooks and confidential material should be when they were meant to be a factual account of cabinet proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notebooks are not open for inspection after cabinet meetings although there have been a few occasions where during those discussions ministers were able, with the approval of the Prime Minister, to look at the notebooks or to have provided to them a summary of the main points so they could refresh their memories. Apart from such instances, there have been only two cases of note where external access to these notebooks has been provided. The first was between 1978 and 1980, when a former cabinet minister, Mr Clyde Cameron, was orally briefed from notebooks concerning cabinet meetings. The second case was in 1983, when the Hope royal commission had access to notebooks relating to matters it was then reviewing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Archives Act, Commonwealth records are accessible when they are over 30 years old. Cabinet notebooks are not regarded as Commonwealth records for the purposes of the act and therefore are not accessible under the Archives Act. Nor are they accessible under the Freedom of Information Act. At present they can be the subject of valid requests for access, as I noted, but access would invariably be denied under section 34(1)(d) of the act, which protects documents which would involve the disclosure of any deliberation or decision of the cabinet. Consequently, those seeking access to cabinet notebooks have been required to go through the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of access to cabinet notebooks under that procedure came especially to the note of the government and to the parliament in 1992, when the case of Northern Land Council v. Commonwealth was before the High Court. The Northern Land Council was trying to gain access to cabinet notebooks, and the government believed that the council would probably succeed. This matter was considered by both the government and the opposition at the time and, in its decision of April 1993, the High Court held that documents recording the deliberations of cabinet fall within a class in respect of which strong considerations of public policy militate against disclosure. Only under quite exceptional circumstances, where there is a significant likelihood that the public interest in the due administration of justice outweighs the public interest in the confidentiality of cabinet documents, will the production of cabinet notebooks be ordered by the court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because cabinet notebooks are clearly important historical documents, it is reasonable that they are made publicly accessible after the passage of an appropriate length of time. Pursuant to the amendments to the Archives Act in this bill, cabinet notebooks will become accessible after a closed period of 50 years. The standard period for the release of documents, as you are aware Mr Deputy Speaker, is 30 years but this was deemed too short as some former ministers may still be alive. Therefore, the decision has been to extend this period to 50 years when former ministers will be well beyond caring. This is a reasonable compromise which balances the competing public interest on the one hand, with the need for appropriate cabinet confidentiality on the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation also amends the Freedom of Information Act to make it clear that cabinet notebooks are excluded from the operation of the act. At present, a valid request for access to cabinet notebooks under FOI can be made, even though the inevitable outcome is that access will be refused, and rightly so. However, the request must still be processed and the material must be identified and detailed, which is a very costly process. In the Northern Land Council case, which I referred to, some 113 notebooks were actually identified. Under future arrangements, as a result of these amendments, such searches will not need to be undertaken because it will not be possible to request access to cabinet notebooks under the freedom of information legislation. The amendments to the Archives Act and the Freedom of Information Act are consequently supported by the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth noting reports that, following the loss of the last state election, out-going ministers in the Victorian state government shredded their state cabinet documents. While I am not suggesting that Commonwealth ministers would necessarily act in a similar manner, I put on record that the opposition is very concerned that, whether or not these acts did occur in Victoria, this should certainly not be regarded as an acceptable form of public behaviour for any government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the significant things about the Westminster system of cabinet government&mdash;and, to my surprise, I found this when we were in government&mdash;is that when a decision is made by a former government, even of a different political persuasion, unless a subsequent decision is made specifically overturning that decision, that cabinet decision stands indefinitely regardless of the government of the day. Most people perhaps are not aware of this fact. They may presume that with a change of government what happened before is de rigueur, past tense, finished, the slate is clean and we start all over again. In fact, that is not how our system of government works. Therefore, to even suggest that it is permissible to destroy cabinet records is utterly and completely an anathema to the very principles upon which cabinet government are based&mdash;not only the Westminster system but in terms of the traditions of the Australian system of government, which varies from Westminster in various ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to refer briefly to some other questions covered in this legislation, particularly the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act, which is amended under the bill. There are two basic amendments and they are both quite significant. The purpose of the first amendment is to clarify that the Merit Protection Review Agency has jurisdiction over Commonwealth employees employed by a statutory authority under an industrial award. The MPRA can conduct appeals and investigations into grievances of people employed under such an enactment. The word `enactment' is defined as an act, ordinance or an instrument, including determinations, rules, regulations or by-laws. It has always been assumed the definition includes industrial awards but apparently that is not the case, and the purpose of this amendment is to clarify that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The full bench of the Industrial Relations Commission has recently raised the possibility that the definition of enactment is not in fact wide enough to encompass industrial awards. Accordingly, this legislation proposes to add industrial awards to the list of determinations included in the definition of enactment to make it quite clear that the MPRA can carry out its functions in relation to people employed under industrial awards. The amendment is retrospective. The opposition has taken a very strong line in recent years against legislation being retrospective. In this case, however, we are of the view that the proposal is not objectionable because all it would do is preserve the status of matters dealt with by the agency in the previous 10 years. So any change to that would create quite unnecessary hardship to individuals who do nothing wrong but go through the process in expectation that the MPRA would be able to handle their cases. Therefore, it is appropriate that matters should be taken as retrospective in this particular case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The MPRA does not automatically have jurisdiction over people employed by a statutory authority under an industrial award. For example, an award must contain a provision which allows use of the MPRA by employees with grievances. If it contains such a provision, then this amendment to the merit protection legislation will ensure that the MPRA can act if it is asked to do so. On the other hand, if the provision does not contain references to this amendment, one would presume that it does not apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment which complements a proposed amendment to the Ombudsman Act 1976 will allow for transfer of complaints between the two agencies, depending on which agency could more properly deal with a complaint. The opposition is supporting that view. In December 1991, the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration tabled an important report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review of the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman</EMPHASIS>. Most of the proposed amendments in this legislation are, in fact, the government's response to that report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In line with the committee's recommendations, the amendments will clarify the Ombudsman's jurisdiction in relation to Commonwealth controlled companies. Commonwealth controlled companies presently fall within the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman only if regulations expressly so provide. Therefore, if regulations ignore this point, clearly Commonwealth controlled companies do not fall within the Ombudsman's purview. These amendments will reverse the situation so that companies created after the commencement of the amendments will clearly fall within the Ombudsman's jurisdiction unless they are specifically excluded by regulations made under the act. The jurisdiction will also be further extended to investigate actions of Federal Court registries and Commonwealth parliamentary departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ombudsman will also gain an explicit discretion to decline to investigate or to cease investigating commercial activities of Commonwealth agencies and the ability to transfer complaints to the Australian Broadcasting Authority, the Merit Protection and Review Agency or an industry ombudsman, such as the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, where appropriate. The amendment will facilitate the transfer of complaints to the Australian Broadcasting Authority. This arises from the recommendation of a Senate committee that the Ombudsman should have jurisdiction to deal with complaints from persons and organisations claiming to have been misrepresented on ABC programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This gives me the opportunity to refer to another issue in relation to the responsibility of the MPRA, on the one hand, and the ombudsman decision, on the other. Members of the House would be aware that over recent months there has been some concern about the handling, in the Public Service context, of two former staff members, known as housekeepers, at the Lodge. These people were dismissed initially under the MOPS legislation&mdash;the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act&mdash;in which there is no clear provision for access to the MPRA. The MPRA is the subject of this legislation. However, persons in that category do have access to the Ombudsman. The interesting situation in this case is that these two women were referred to in derogatory terms in evidence given to Senate estimates committees. Allegations were made that they had overspent on credit cards and matters such as that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, when their positions were terminated, they were both given certificates of service issued by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet which stated that they had committed no wrongdoing either of a serious or a light nature. Consequently, there is a contradiction here. On the one hand, their reputations have been effectively attacked before a Senate committee; on the other hand, their erstwhile employer, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, says that they have done nothing wrong. But it was officers of the same department who said that they had done something wrong: they had overspent on credit card limits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue still remains unresolved. Gardini and Co., solicitors and attorneys for these two women, has acted on their behalf. Representations have been made to various members of parliament. Issues have been raised by me in this parliament as well as in the Senate. The difficulty arises from the fact that the Ombudsman initially publicly stated that she would investigate pre-employment matters. While she is not authorised under her interpretation of her regulations to investigate actions of a minister, nevertheless, section 5(3) of the Ombudsman Act allows her to investigate actions taken by a delegate of a minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, in this case under the MOPS Act the Prime Minister was able to delegate his responsibilities to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The Ombudsman says, `A decision was made by a minister, ergo it is policy. Therefore, I as the Ombudsman cannot review that decision'. But, at the same time, under section 5(3), she clearly accepts that she does have the right to review a decision made by an authority or by a person to whom the responsibility has been delegated. The sad fact is that, despite all this, the Ombudsman is determined that she cannot carry the issue any further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case the housekeepers were dismissed under a power of delegation signed by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on 17 January 1992 under section 33 of the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act 1984. Surely in those circumstances there is a prima facie case that the Ombudsman does have the jurisdiction to investigate the circumstances of the housekeepers' termination. Efforts have been made to raise this with the Ombudsman, apparently so far without success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, I put on the record of this parliament that I think it is of fundamental importance that, if we are to have a system to review decisions, whether it be through the ombudsman system or through the Merit Protection and Review Agency process, we cannot have exceptions. If it is to be argued that the MOPS Act creates a different classification, I would urge the government to review the MOPS Act because that apparently is creating two classes of civil servants&mdash;those who are under normal Public Service rules and those who are under the so-called Members of Parliament (Staff) Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are inconsistencies when it comes back to the fundamental question of human rights. When somebody has been attacked and their reputation has been besmirched before this parliament everybody says that it is all too difficult, there is collective washing of hands in the best Pontius Pilate manner and these two women are left hanging. They are not wealthy people; they are not powerful people. They have done all they can to access the system and in this case quite clearly the system has been found wanting. I hope the government will do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to the Public Service Act 1922 and the Superannuation Act 1976, this legislation contains some worthwhile changes to the handling of departmental heads. Under the new arrangements, it effectively means that persons either inside or outside the service may be taken on as departmental heads for a fixed term of office. Previously, there was no conception of a fixed term of office. It was like professors at the university: they were in a tenured situation and a person could not be removed. Under the new proposal, departmental heads will be given, for example, a fixed term contract of, say, five years. The quid pro quo of losing tenure will be that they will have access to an additional 20 per cent salary increase, which would not be available to people who remain in tenure. I and the opposition believe that this is a worthwhile change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a sense, it brings the permanent head status, which will no longer be permanent, as I have emphasised, more or less in line with the Senior Executive Service arrangements where a significant number of positions which are now advertised openly&mdash;in other words, available to people outside as well as inside the service&mdash;give people the option of either a career position or access to a fixed contract term. That is often useful for the individual as well as the department, depending on the nature of the work which is to be undertaken. It also gives the government some flexibility in the types of people it may wish to appoint as permanent heads of departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been some interesting examples in recent times where, with the restructuring of departments, it simply has not been possible to terminate the services of secretaries and they have been kept on as joint secretaries. This is a bizarre arrangement in many respects. Effectively, it means that two secretaries are running a department of state. That is a contradiction in terms. As the law stood, it was extremely difficult to remove officers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be watching this very carefully in terms of the regulations under the act to ensure that the civil rights of persons who are appointed either under contract or under existing arrangements are fully protected, but a balance has to be achieved. Clearly, it is not in the public interest for a person who is no longer fulfilling a function to still be paid the full salary for doing less than what that salary is meant for. Therefore, the position needs to be terminated and these provisions allow that to take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also some other minor changes which are perhaps of some interest. For example, the bill amends the act to allow departments to apply an order of merit principle when filling positions which were filled on the advice of a joint select committee and become vacant within six months of the original appointment. People may wonder why matters of such little consequence are included in legislation, but I go on the record as saying that they are not matters of little consequence. In many cases positions attract literally hundreds of applications. It is difficult to put in place a methodology which is fair to all those applications while, at the same time, giving the department the capacity to reaccess those people in the event that a similar or even identical position becomes available within a reasonable period of, say, six months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only last week a case received media attention in Tasmania. The Commonwealth Employment Service advertised for some positions. It got literally hundreds of applications. It spent in excess of $90,000 going through the process of interviewing all those people. Various comments were made about all this terrible waste of money. The point needs to be made that the department does have the responsibility not only to safeguard the taxpayers' expenditure but also to be fair to the people who have made application for these positions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the advantages of this amendment is that, by having the order of merit concept, the position is obviously offered initially to the first person on the list. If that person rejects the offer, the position is then offered to the second person, then to the third and so on. When the position is filled, the subsequent order of merit is still in existence which can then come into operation should that position again fall vacant or a similar position become available. That obviates the need for extensive advertising and for the substantial personnel commitment to the establishment of the joint selection committees and so forth under the merit protection arrangements. Clearly, that is a saving to the taxpayer and is certainly administratively simple for all concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition supports the passage of this legislation. Whilst we are not questioning the integrity of the Cabinet Office or its staff&mdash;certainly to the best of my knowledge there has never been a case in terms of the Commonwealth jurisdiction&mdash;as I stated earlier, we are very concerned at this allegation that the Victorian state Labor government did shred state cabinet documents prior to leaving office. We seek a reassurance from this government that all future cabinet records and documents will be kept in safe keeping. </PARA>

Although my colleague the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) has outlined in detail the coalition's position on these various amendments, in my capacity as the shadow minister for science, technology and export development I would like to make a few comments relating to the amendments to the Australian Science and Technology Council Act 1978.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The support staff of the Australian Science and Technology Council&mdash;ASTEC, as it is more commonly known&mdash;presently constitute a separate department under the Public Service Act. Pursuant to the amendments proposed in this bill, these staff will be integrated into the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the primary source of information and advice to the government on matters relating to science and technology policy matters, ASTEC has had a key role in promoting the development and application of Australian science and technology. Its extensive responsibilities have ranged from the advancement of general scientific knowledge to the identification and support of new ideas in science and technology that can contribute to the country's future development. Given the critical link between innovation and the economic growth of nations and their comparative and competitive advantage, ASTEC's part in focusing and fostering innovation in Australian industry cannot be overstated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of background to this debate, I am sure that honourable members will recall that it was the coalition that first established an advisory body on science and technology policy. The McMahon government set up the Advisory Committee in Science and Technology a little more than two decades ago. Unfortunately, this body had a very short life as it soon became a victim of the Whitlam government, and it took the election of another coalition government, the Fraser government, for a permanent Australian Science and Technology Council to be established with a close relationship to the Prime Minister. This was done in 1977. This gives an indication of the coalition's historic commitment to science and technology, a commitment which underpins our belief that science and technology must play an integral role in any worthwhile vision of our future as a strong and independent nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I pointed out during a debate in this place yesterday, sound investment in science and technology and innovative practices is generally one of the principal means by which Australia can make its way in today's highly competitive global marketplace. Indeed, given the extensive focus on these areas by our main international competitors, such an investment is essential if Australia is to avoid slipping further behind. Unfortunately, the reality is that we are a very long way from achieving such a situation. The government has been unable or unwilling to implement any clear strategic framework for the long-term development of Australian science and technology. The effort needed to cement a culture of innovation in the national psyche, described by the Business Council of Australia's innovative study commission as `imperative to enable Australian businesses to be internationally competitive', has not been forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those who wish to look&mdash;there are many opposite who would rather, I fear, bury their heads in the sand&mdash;the signs of failure are there to see. Australia has one of the weakest industrial research and development efforts in the developed world. Despite all the government's huffing and puffing, and despite recent improvements in the performance in industry and in research and development, the fact remains that Australia's relative performance in this regard has not pushed us up one rung on the international ladder during the past decade. In the mid-1980s, Australia was 17th out of 24 OECD nations in terms of its private sector research and development effort and we are still 17th today. This month's current account deficit of $1.26 billion is another grim reminder that as a nation we are living beyond our means and still have a very long way to go in relation to our export performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The science and technology statement released each year has little meaning as a policy statement. Departmental missions in science and technology are unclear and there is little effort at forward thinking to provide universities, research councils and industry with a genuine sense of direction. There has been a refusal to address the issue of declining research infrastructure within the universities, despite the findings of the government's own National Board of Employment, Education and Training, which identified `serious shortcomings' in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government can do much more to encourage a wider appreciation of the importance of science and technology to Australia's future. The quality of science and technology education in schools is a key part of such a strategy. Yet there has so far been little or no effective action to address the `downgrading' of scientific knowledge and skills in favour of `social and political agendas' that the Australian Academy of Science was so critical of in the draft profile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the policy advisory process in science and technology is not working optimally. The science and engineering council of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has so far, despite good features, which I do not deny, failed to fulfil expectations that it would consider strategic issues for Australian science and do so in a way which would lead to a strategic perspective and framework being brought to bear upon government policy in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The academies have largely been sidelined in a policy sense, even though they have great capacity to be more closely involved in the process of advising government on science policy initiatives. Indeed, this is probably to some extent one of the unintended consequences of the role that ASTEC has played over the years. ASTEC for some time has faced certain difficulties. It has, since the Fraser government, had a special relationship with the Prime Minister, but of course the importance of this relationship to the promotion of science and technology in this country depends on the interest of the Prime Minister in the development of Australian capacity in these areas. When the Prime Minister has had little interest, ASTEC has been left out on a limb. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know of course the level of interest of the present Prime Minister in science and technology. This was confirmed for us by the President of the Labour Party, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones). He made it quite clear at the recent ANZUS conference that the Prime Minister is really not interested in Australia's science and technology effort. As the honourable member for Lalor said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To date he hasn't shown conspicuous interest in science.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . is not yet knowledgeable about science and technology . . . We would like to help him learn . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the Prime Minister faces a difficulty in becoming knowledgeable in this area because he has chosen&mdash;characteristically, in view of the politics of the New South Wales right faction and the way it operates&mdash;to appoint his key numbers man as the minister for science, a minister who really has very little interest in this area, who has become known for making science policy on the run, without any substantial consultative process being undertaken, in an ad hoc way, to meet what seem to be the political needs of the minister. Indeed, it is quite extraordinary that this minister, after the fiasco of his first year in office when he succeeded in alienating virtually the entire science community in Australia with his unthought out recommendations to reorganise the nation's leading scientific organisations, has apparently returned to the fray. </PARA>

Perhaps the departure of the honourable member for Canberra from her ministerial position has encouraged him to take up an issue which previously he was unable to successfully promote amongst his ministerial and cabinet colleagues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. My remarks are very much directed to the principal issue raised by the bill, which is the nature of the advisory and policy making processes of the government in relation to science and technology policy. The point I am making, by referring to this extraordinary report about Senator Schacht in this morning's press, is to illustrate again how unsatisfactory the current policy making process in this area is. The changes that are a part of this bill unfortunately do nothing to give any assurance to the coalition or to the science community generally that the government is interested in establishing an appropriate policy process for science and for technology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have commented on the difficulties that ASTEC faced in its previous incarnation because of the lack of interest of the Prime Minister in policy. Because of the special relationship that this organisation has had with the Prime Minister, it is only able to be effective if indeed there is a genuine prime ministerial interest. But, as I have said, there is none. There has also been a difficulty of process faced by ASTEC in actioning its reports because, once made, these reports have no clear path through the bureaucracy which might lead to their being acted on in an effective way. As a result of this sort of consideration, it was the view of the coalition before the 1993 election that there was much to be said for merging ASTEC completely with the science council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992 the government established a review of ASTEC, headed by Sir Rupert Myers. The Myers committee concluded that although ASTEC should continue as a separate organisation with its present functions, it had lost some of its initial drive and needed to enhance its effectiveness. In order to improve its capacity to undertake its work, the review committee considered that ASTEC should give greater emphasis to industrial applications of science and technology and should increase the proportion of its members from an industrial background. It also believed that ASTEC should provide the government with new ideas and greater warning about issues that may shape the science and technology policy agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the government has not accepted this recommendation. Indeed, it has preferred to move some distance, but only some distance, towards the coalition position. But, in not accepting the coalition's policy on this, it has left ASTEC in a kind of limbo land, in an uncertain position, neither independent nor a fully integrated part of the science council arrangements. This has led, not surprisingly, to confusion about what the minister has had to say about these arrangements. He has described ASTEC, on the one hand, as the government's primary source of independent advice, yet the provision in this bill transfers responsibility for ASTEC staff to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, which would seem to mean a significant reduction in the independence of ASTEC. The government's confusion on this matter is really a part of the broad pattern of lack of direction and lack of purpose that is evident throughout this policy area at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nature of the arrangement which is foreshadowed in this bill really raises a number of significant questions about the advisory processes on science and technology. The science council has been focused particularly on specific issues rather than on broad strategic questions. The presentations to the science council have come essentially from those interested in these policy areas and, therefore, have not really provided in themselves as documents appropriate bases for government action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the steps which could be taken to upgrade the role of the science council and to give the government a greater sense of direction would be for that council to focus more on major strategic issues in the area of science and technology policy. Unfortunately, so far we see little sign that this is happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment ASTEC is in a kind of limbo land. The government has neither abolished it nor given it independence. It is not clear what its role is to be. If it is to be the government's primary advisory body on science policy issues, one can only wonder why, when the government was looking for policy advice on the future of nuclear science or marine science, it did not ask ASTEC to provide it with advice and in the end set up independent inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am afraid this piece of legislation raises, and continues to raise, very significant questions about the way the government is conducting policy in this area.

It seems that since 1951 there has been a system in place to facilitate the formal recording of the outcome of cabinet deliberations. It was developed as a means of assisting the cabinet process in that respect by providing an effective link between the private deliberations in the cabinet room and the Public Service, which of course gives effect to government decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system allows cabinet minutes, which constitute the formal record of cabinet decisions, to be circulated to ministers and departments as soon as possible for appropriate action. The practice is to have three note takers at cabinet meetings. They are officers of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. One of them is the secretary to the cabinet. At least one of the note takers attempts to take as full a record as possible of discussions. The form of the notes is entirely within the discretion of each note taker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the notebooks do not record verbatim the proceedings of cabinet, the note takers do endeavour to record the gist of the contributions of individual ministers. Their object is to provide an aid in the drafting of cabinet minutes. The cabinet minutes, which record the collective decision of ministers on particular items, do not contain any reference to the contributions of individual ministers to discussion on particular items. The notebooks, therefore, contain records which are merely a means to the end of preparing a definitive minute which will be generally circulated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Access to the notebooks is very limited. Ministers, including prime ministers, do not have direct access to cabinet notebooks. The practice, apparently, is for the note takers, at the request of a minister, to refer to the notebooks for the purpose of assisting an individual minister to recall his or her individual contribution to a discussion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that on one occasion in the past a former minister the Hon. Clyde Cameron was given that sort of access to notebooks relating to a period when he was a member of the cabinet. It seems that there is only one occasion when the contents of a notebook have been shown to a person outside the cabinet system. This was done with the express agreement of the Prime Minister, at the time of the Hope royal commission in 1983, for the purpose of examining issues concerning the actions of a cabinet minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill proposes that, for the purposes of the Archives Act, access to cabinet notebooks be restricted for a period of 50 years. As the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), the shadow minister responsible for the bill, has indicated, the coalition accepts the appropriateness of that. The point I highlight is that, while in the 1992 bill the government sought to limit access to cabinet notebooks for the purpose of court proceedings, in this bill there is no such attempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The action of the government in introducing the 1992 bill was prompted by a case then in the Federal Court brought by the Northern Land Council against the Commonwealth. The council was seeking the production of cabinet notebooks to assist in setting aside an agreement entered into by the Northern Land Council. In the Federal Court, Mr Justice Jenkinson considered the objections of the Commonwealth to the production of the notebooks but determined that they should be produced. He directed that 113 cabinet notebooks be made available, not to the council but to the legal representatives of the council, for the purpose of the proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case was taken on appeal to the full Federal Court and the decision of the trial judge was unanimously upheld. It was at that juncture that the 1992 bill was introduced. Subsequent to the lapse of the bill, the matter was dealt with by the High Court, which delivered a decision in April of 1993. The High Court determined by a majority of six to one that the Commonwealth should not have been ordered to produce the notebooks for inspection. The majority judgment contains some interesting comments on the nature of cabinet government as understood by the members of the majority. The judgment stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst there is increasing public insistence upon the concept of open government, we do not think that it has yet been suggested that Members of Cabinet would not be severely hampered in the performance of the function expected of them if they had constantly to look over their shoulders at those who would seek to criticize and publicize their participation in discussions in the Cabinet room. It is not so much a matter of encouraging candour or frankness as of ensuring that decision-making and policy development by Cabinet is uninhibited.</PARA>
<PARA>However, the High Court determined that the claim by a minister of immunity from production pursuant to a court order was not absolute. The court determined that the production of the documents recording cabinet deliberations could be ordered but held that such an order should only be made in exceptional circumstances which give rise to a significant likelihood that the public interest in the administration of justice outweighs the very high public interest in the confidentiality of such documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The court determined that it was doubtful whether civil proceedings would ever warrant the production of documents recording cabinet deliberations upon a matter which was current or controversial. It was the view of the majority that, in criminal proceedings, exceptional circumstances might exist if withholding the documents would prevent a successful prosecution or impede the conduct of the defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the very limited circumstances in which disclosure will be permitted, the government has apparently decided, and the bill reflects it, that it is unnecessary specifically to prohibit the production of cabinet notebooks in court proceedings. The coalition accepts that this is a realistic and sensible approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that was emphasised in the Northern Land Council case is that, in the determination of a claim for what used to be called `crown privilege', what is now usually referred to as `public interest immunity', the appropriate course to be followed is for the court to assess the validity of the claim and for that purpose to inspect documents for the purpose of deciding whether the claim should be upheld. It needs to be highlighted for the purpose of the debate on this bill that the High Court was saying that this principle is applicable to what are, in effect, the most sacrosanct of the documents held by executive government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That approach by the government in relation to courts contrasts sharply with the approach by the government in relation to houses of parliament and to parliamentary committees exercising the powers of a house of parliament. Yesterday in question time I asked the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) a question without notice relating to the very issue. I suggested that the Attorney-General was aware, and he was, of the practice of the courts, and in his reply he referred to the Northern Land Council case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But his reply went on to assert what I regard as wrong and unacceptable propositions. The Attorney said that the fundamental weakness implicit in my question was that I was equating the role of a committee of the parliament with the role of the court. That is not correct at all. But, taken at a more limited level, it is wrong, in my view, for the Attorney to suggest that one cannot in some limited situations equate a house of parliament or a parliamentary committee with a court. It is wrong as a matter of principle in the context of where a house or a committee seeks the production of documents or summons a witness to give evidence. We have to bear in mind, of course, that the courts and parliament have identical historical origins. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the modern courts, however, parliament has not developed mechanisms for dealing with competing claims of immunity from production and an order for production of documents. It seems to me that there is no reason why parliamentary committees cannot develop similar mechanisms to those that courts have used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, in fact, one example of an attempt by a parliamentary committee to do what courts commonly do. It is referred to in the third report of 1992 of the Procedure Committee of the Senate. What occurred in 1982 is recorded in the report in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Resolutions then passed by the Senate requiring the production of documents to a person appointed to act as the Senate's agent to delete from the documents material which should not be disclosed, particularly on the ground of risk of prejudice to legal proceedings . . .</PARA>
<PARA>This is also referred to in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Senate Practice</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other mechanisms used by a court can readily be suggested. It would be appropriate in some situations, for example, for a chairman and deputy chairman of a committee to be the only persons to inspect the documents. Counsel assisting a committee could be given the role of inspecting the documents for the purpose of advising on the claim. A committee could go into camera. A variety of mechanisms are available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second suggestion made by the Attorney-General was that the issue is in effect settled by a paper written in 1972. The paper to which the Attorney-General referred, as I understand it, is a paper by the Attorney-General at the time, Senator Ivor Greenwood QC, and the Solicitor-General of the time, Mr Robert Ellicott QC. It is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Parliamentary committees: powers over and protection afforded to witnesses</EMPHASIS>. That paper set out what was accepted wisdom of the day&mdash;that a claim by a minister for public interest immunity was in effect conclusive. It has to be pointed out, however, that at that time that was the view also of the courts. Since then there have been major changes; in fact, they had started prior to the 1972 report with the decision of the House of Lords in Conway v. Rimmer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that time there have been dramatic changes, culminating in the Northern Land Council case in the High Court last year. In addition, we have seen major changes in the statutory scheme relating to the accountability of government; we have the establishment of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; we have judicial review formalised under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act; we have an ombudsman; and, most relevantly, we have the Freedom of Information Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of interest also that the views expressed in 1972 by Senator Greenwood and Mr Ellicott were not adhered to by them for long. In an addendum to a report of the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges of 7 October 1975, Senator Greenwood referred to the 1972 report and indicated that his view had changed. He pointed out that `the conclusiveness of the minister's certificate is for the Senate to determine'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Ellicott also changed his view. In evidence he gave to the Senate's current print media inquiry on 16 February 1994, he indicated that the 1972 view was based on principles established by courts which had long since changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General also referred to the practice since 1972&mdash;which, he alleged, has been continuously followed by government&mdash;that the certification by a minister as to the public interest of a particular document to be kept confidential should be accepted by the parliamentary committee inquiring into the subject. That assertion of what is said to be a practice, I have to reject. There is no instance to which I can draw attention where any house of parliament, or even a parliamentary committee, has accepted that view. There are many instances where there has been a contest between a parliamentary committee and the executive government as to the production of a document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my opinion, it is really quite unacceptable that the current stand-off should continue in the way it does. Accountability by ministers, accountability by the executive government, is fundamental to the democratic system. It is also incumbent, in my view, on both houses and parliamentary committees to develop mechanisms for appropriate assessment of accountability on this important issue, the accountability of a minister for a claim to public interest immunity in respect of documents or, similarly, in respect of witnesses. In relation to the cabinet notebooks provisions, the coalition supports the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The statement by the Minister for Defence, Senator Ray, when he tabled the review highlighted the main features of the strategic review. In my comments this afternoon I will elaborate on the ramifications of the new global and regional environment for Australia's defence science and industry. My contribution follows earlier ones by the minister representing the Minister for Defence in this House, the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), and also the shadow spokesman for defence, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), in what I must say was the least objectionable set of words I have heard him string together in this place for a long time, in the spirit of bipartisanship on defence in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic review 1993</EMPHASIS> reaffirms the importance of Australian industry in contributing to our defence self-reliance. It emphasises the need for clarifying further the defence priorities for support from Australian industry and the advantage of defence engagement with the region. This more precise targeting of what industrial capacity is strategic for defence is currently being researched by the Defence Industry Committee, which is chaired by Mr David Hoare, and will be further elaborated on in the forthcoming white paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local industry has benefited from defence contracts over the past decade. In pursuing greater defence self-reliance, the government has increased the proportion of spending in Australia on new major capital defence systems and equipment over the past decade from around 30 per cent to approximately 65 per cent. In total, 88.9 per cent of the 1993-94 defence budget of $9.786 billion will be spent in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Defence depends heavily on Australian industry for the provision of goods and services, this emphasis on self-reliance does not mean we can or need seek to be self-sufficient. Beyond the combat and combat related needs of our defence capability, Australia will not need to carry out all tasks itself. There are also limits to the extent to which Australia can divorce itself from overseas support, particularly in important areas of new and complex technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Complete self-sufficiency is unachievable, and this would divert resources from priority defence tasks at the expense of capability. Hence, as well as developing local support capabilities, ensuring the ability to draw on support from overseas is an integral part of the government's strategic planning for defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the release of defence policy guidelines for industry in 1984, the government has maintained its emphasis on the need for defence industry policy to be consistent with broader defence policy and correspondingly strategic requirements. Areas of industry identified as important to the long-term effectiveness of our defence forces are repair, adaption and maintenance of equipment&mdash;consumables, where we can least rely on overseas sourcing and stockpiling&mdash;and, in some cases, the development of new technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1987 defence white paper and the 1992 defence policy and industry report restated these requirements and provided some broad priorities for Australian industry capabilities. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic review 1993</EMPHASIS> develops the theme further. It outlines more comprehensively those capability areas in which Defence will look to local industry for support. These areas are: command, control and communications, information technology, intelligence, surveillance, weapons platforms, combat systems, munitions and logistic support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More specific capability priorities for industry will continue to evolve as Defence more precisely defines operational requirements and the capabilities to meet these requirements. In terms of key Australian Defence Force priorities, in broad terms the capability Defence is looking for from industry may be defined by reference to sector categories. I will mention some of these now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, taking command control and communications functions, defence requires the best technology available in the world, adapted to our environment, fully integrated and secure, to ensure an edge over any potential adversary. Given technological advances in the commercial field, Defence is looking to increase its support from industry in the software development and systems integration areas, recognising that some technology transfer from overseas may be involved. Security integration and adaption require considerable indigenous industry support and Defence will aim to maximise the use of technology that has dual defence and civilian applications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I refer to the important area of intelligence. Defence intelligence requires systems that provide a high level of operational availability on a continuous basis and timely distribution to users. In the same way as I mentioned for command control and communications activity, in the intelligence function, software support and systems integration are also important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For surveillance, defence requires leading edge technology adapted to meet our unique geophysical environment. It also needs advanced facilities for the integration and analysis of information from various sources. Maintenance and through life support of these systems by Australian industry are a high priority for defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to weapons platforms, the maintenance, repair and through life support of weapons platforms are a high priority for industry assistance to defence. Adaption to meet our environment, once again, is a high priority. The production or manufacture of platforms in Australia will be a priority when it represents value for money or where it contributes to the development of capabilities and skills required for through life support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The maintenance, repair and through life support of combat systems are of the same high priority as they are for weapons platforms. Especially important is the capability to integrate weapons systems with associated command, control and communication systems and the skills required, once again, to adapt them to our environment. With regard to munitions, Defence will be looking for a combination of supply by Australian industry for high usage items and for those items where the possibility exists for disruption of overseas supply and of our stockpiling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, in this listing of strategic industry capabilities, I turn to logistic support, including transport and supply of consumables. In this field, Defence will make maximum use of facilities and services already available in our community. In particular, Defence will be looking for increased industry support in the north of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I have just outlined suggests that certain industry sectors will be of particular importance to Defence. The electronics and optics industry will be required to look to support intelligence systems, systems integration activities, weapons systems and surveillance. The communications and information technology industries will be looked to for support of command, control and communication systems, intelligence systems and critical management and administration systems to integrate with specific weapon systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aerospace industry will be looked to for support in the maintenance and provisions of infrastructure for the operation of aircraft and their systems, and to adopt and adapt various aircraft systems from around the world. The shipbuilding and repair industry can expect opportunities to support and maintain ships and their systems and to adapt other systems. The munitions industry, which the government owns, will be required to produce stocks of high usage munitions and maintain sophisticated munitions such as missiles. To complete the list, in relation to land vehicles, local suppliers can be expected to look for and to adapt, repair and maintain vehicles suited to Australia's terrain and environment. In addition to this list of industries, Defence is increasingly looking to broader Australian industry on a competitive basis to provide support services, consumable items and minor capital items across a very wide range of areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our defence policy has always tried to ensure that our capabilities are of adequate technological level to meet any likely threat to Australia. Our use of advanced technology will continue to be a key element in our overall defence approach. Our emphasis on technology reflects the realities of a small population defending a large country, as well as our technical capacity to use advanced equipment. The range of new technologies relative to defence is expanding. We should continue to seek innovative applications to increase our capacity for defence in the context of a constrained resource outlook. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the limitations on resources, we must be selective in our use of advanced technology. We need the most advanced  capabilities in areas such as command and control, information transfer and integration, all-weather day and night operations, and the ability to control and concentrate force rapidly and precisely. Judgments on the balance between technological quality and the quantity of equipment will become increasingly important. Planning should identify opportunities for quality and quantity trade-off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We invest heavily in defence science and technology as taxpayers. Close collaboration is required between defence science and industry in the development of new capabilities. Industry should be encouraged to undertake complete engineering developments to the point where they can be acquired by Defence's new capabilities. The Defence Science and Technology Organisation should undertake engineering development only for high priority capability areas if local or overseas industry cannot do so at an acceptable cost or if security considerations are paramount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Defence more clearly defines its operational capabilities and the in-country industry capabilities required by the defence forces, priorities will be communicated to industry. Defence maintains regular contact with industry to keep its members informed of the needs of our defence forces. Industry has a role to play in bringing new capabilities into service and enhancing the effectiveness of equipment already in service. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic review 1993</EMPHASIS> emphasises the need for close collaboration between defence science and industry in the development of new capabilities, and industry is expected to play an increasing role in supporting existing capability through the commercial support program. Whenever it is practical and cost-effective to do Defence should `buy Australian' to support self-reliance. We need a judicious blend of overseas and indigenous sources, complemented by stockpiling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the remaining time available, can I simply say that the<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Strategic review 1993</EMPHASIS> provides a useful guide to local industry. It places the relationship between Defence and industry on a solid footing by enunciating clearly our industry goals in relation to strategic goals. Although further work needs to be done to implement these measures, the government is convinced that the existing successful track record of Australian industry, combined with its obvious potential for additional growth, augurs well for the nation and its defence. Defence will continue its commitment to optimise local industry support capabilities which are critical to the defence of Australia, within our collective security cooperation with our immediate neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To conclude, in addition to its value to industry, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic review 1993</EMPHASIS> provides for the community, both here and abroad, a comprehensive guide to the underlying principles motivating Australia's defence strategy. It also makes clear the government's commitment to emphasising a combined economic, trade and diplomatic approach to improving our relations in our region. I expect that the review and the government's broad policy in defence will receive widespread community support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I thank the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch) for having spoken as he did. I had been under the rather foolish impression that the blue meant what it said. The blue, of course, is the program of the House. If honourable members look at that, they will see that this matter is listed for debate later this afternoon. I left the Turkish Foreign Minister in order to return. I thank the minister for being here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The defence strategic review follows what is a regular and recurrent appraisal of Australia's defence situation, known as the strategic bases paper, which is submitted successively to cabinet and is a product of a fairly close consideration between the Department of Defence, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Prime Minister's department and Treasury of how they see the world around us. Because of its nature as a public document, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic review 1993</EMPHASIS> tends to be a fairly bland document which does not tell us any of the things we really want to know. I suppose that is to be expected, but it is regrettable, because the result tends to underplay some of those situations which all of us see around us but which we tend to ignore. Because it is the first paper presented since the end of the Cold War, I think it is unfortunate that that should be so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at the overall strategic threat, I want to first identify a couple of concerns that, while mentioned in the paper, do not seem to me to be adequately exposed. As I have explained, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic review 1993</EMPHASIS>&mdash;in its glossy cover and looking pretty, and being presented by the Minister for Defence, Senator Ray&mdash;is a document that he feels is sufficiently innocuous to be exposed to public gaze. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My worry&mdash;for all that I know, given any type of token significance by a minister of the government&mdash;is perhaps highlighted as a result. There are a number of worries which all of us in our theatre have, and which I do not think are sufficiently stated in the paper. Let me refer to the first, because this is the first paper since the end of the Cold War. What is happening about the outbreak of nationalism in what was the Soviet Union, which became the Commonwealth of Independent States, and which is now that loose affiliation of countries that are gradually trying to work out their way in the world?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within those countries, there are markedly independent national groups still asserting their individuality. The tragedy of it all is that it is really no better than what is going on in Bosnia-Herzergovina at the moment. In that area of the Balkans, in the Middle East and in the former soviet republics, there are many nations which are still asserting their right to be different. I say nations, but I really mean national groups. The conflict between individuals linked together because of their origins, and the extent to which they seek to resort to violence to resolve their futures, are matters of great concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put that point first, since it is because of the outbreak of new nationalism that the United Nations has been turned to as a vehicle by which resolution of problems can be found. Peacekeeping is a subject that has involved Australia and, properly, the Australian Defence Force, although not so much perhaps in 1994 as in 1992 and 1993. But there are several characteristics of Australia's role in peacekeeping that need to be related back to that first area, which I see as perhaps inadequately dealt with within the strategic review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like a recognition by the wider community of the unique capability that we have within the Australian Defence Force. Australia is a peculiar country. We are all extraordinarily proud of it and we feel quite comfortable with our Australian identity. However, we need to understand that, in a multinational peacekeeping group, those rather casual, self-sufficient, get-on-with-one's-neighbour, hail-fellow-well-met characteristics&mdash;or however Australians are described&mdash;have been the core reasons why Australian forces have been so extraordinarily successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is much in that of which we should be proud. However, being proud and recognising the role they play has a price, and the price is that there has been a significant commitment by the Australian Defence Force to peacekeeping which, in terms of personnel, equipment and expenditure, has meant that we have spent a lot more of our time than many expected in recent years in a role that is not even part of the defence task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I think it would have been appropriate to have mentioned that broader problem in the strategic review paper. I have done it in a generic sense, and I am not talking about any one nation. The first thing we have to do with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic review 1993</EMPHASIS> is to try to work out what sort of role Australia is going to play in the defence of the wider world and where that affects our security, as distinct from just what our national defence threat is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic review 1993</EMPHASIS> has sufficiently analysed the obligations that all of us feel come to a country like Australia which does not have a territorial neighbour, but which has an opportunity to play a significant role in trying to help others to help themselves, and so win peace in the world and achieve, hopefully, not only recognition of human rights, but also recognition of the democratic rights that, sadly, exist in so few countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My first concern in terms of the strategic review comes out of that wider world scene. I do not feel that enough emphasis is given to the rather extraordinary characteristic of Australians of all shapes, colours, races, creeds, origins and beliefs to endear themselves to their fellow men and women and to be able to fit into any community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anybody who saw, for example, the peacekeeping force in Somalia or the peacekeepers in Cambodia would realise how extraordinary that characteristic is. An Australian private or corporal will have relatively senior officers of other countries coming to him or her because of that unique capability of being able to get on with others and help people to help themselves. In that respect, I would have liked there to have been a slightly different emphasis within the overall embrace of the strategic review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point relates to the defence of Australia. I have a concern about Papua New Guinea. Whilst there are some fairly blunt statements within the strategic review about Papua New Guinea, I do not think any of us can understate the situation in Bougainville and the extraordinary difficulty that we have had with the relationship with Papua New Guinea as it evolves as a separate nation. We have withdrawn much of our budget support and we are moving towards project aid. We have tried to allow Papua New Guinea to be totally independent. Despite that, I suspect that in our region the Australian Defence Force has less knowledge of the capabilities and the directions of the individual members of the Papua New Guinea defence force than it has of the personnel of every other country in our region. That is unfortunate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that Australia accept several things. Firstly, while nobody on either side of the political fence in this place would consider Papua New Guinea as anything other than a totally independent country, we do have a particular responsibility to try to assist Papua New Guinea to face up to the enormous problems it will have in the future. The problems are compounded by its history and geography. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I read the other day that there are something like 4,500 languages in the world&mdash;I cannot remember the exact figure&mdash;of which about 1,500 are now spoken and about 600 of them are in Papua New Guinea. The division in that country is absolutely unbelievable. It is, I guess, a product of the physical terrain and lack of contact with the outside world. Honourable members who have been there will know the magnificent mountains&mdash;and the Kokoda Trail&mdash;over which Australians fought against the Japanese during World War II. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The country is extraordinarily isolated because of that terrain, and it also creates problems in trying to form one nation. In Australia state boundaries were laid down because Australia was a colony of the United Kingdom. The Papua New Guinea boundaries were laid down because New Guinea was originally a colony of Germany and Papua was a colony of the United Kingdom&mdash;Papua was at one stage part of Australia&mdash;so Papua New Guinea has boundaries that are not exactly those that the people who live there necessarily recognise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an enormous problem in defining just what are the rights and freedoms of the people in Bougainville, and how in Australia we can ensure that those who have suffered are no longer going to suffer, that medical aid and other forms of aid are available to the Bougainvilleans and, as well, how Bougainville is going to establish itself in the future; I hope that it is within Papua New Guinea. But whatever the future, I certainly do not believe that Australia can isolate itself from that situation. Nothing about the Bougainville situation is in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic review 1993</EMPHASIS>, yet to my mind it is probably the most immediate flashpoint on which we need to spend some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other major matters which I think have not been adequately dealt with in the strategic review. I have not mentioned Korea, where I see the prospects of a nuclear holocaust as more real than anywhere else in the world. I have not spoken of the problems that I still see in the settlement of Indochina, of the difficulties that still exist on the borders between Vietnam and China, Vietnam and Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia, and Cambodia and Thailand, nor have I spoken about Burma, now called Myanmar. There are a number of countries in our region that I do not think are adequately dealt with in the review and yet all of them affect us. I do not think we have been giving enough attention to the overall role of Australia in peacekeeping in the world or to the problems of Australia and Papua New Guinea. I think they should be paramount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time left to me, I will refer briefly to one other aspect of the strategic review. As we all know, it will be followed by a white paper. There are three aspects to that. The first is that for the services there has been a real trauma that no white paper presented by either side of politics has in fact been funded over recent years. It is extraordinarily difficult if the Defence Force is expected to be able to develop a defence capability but funds are not provided for it to do so. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr SINCLAIR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. A strategic review is produced and everybody says, `Gee, that is great', and we criticise or commend it. Then a white paper is produced and everybody says, `Right, that is the booklet on which we are going to develop our Defence Force', and then the government does not provide the money. There is a real problem. I am not blaming the Labor Party, because we were just as bad; I was the last conservative minister for defence, so I recognise the problem. But I make the point that it is no use creating an expectation from a white paper that is not going to be realistically funded. I hope that in the production of the white paper the government ensures that Treasury is well and truly tied down, because there is a reason to maintain an adequate, viable Defence Force. We have excellent men and women in the Australian Defence Force and I feel very sad when they are not funded adequately. That is the first point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is that the government has made a great deal of the fact that there has been a significant increase in local content for defence systems and equipment. I commend it for that. But I am most unhappy that we are too dependent on overseas design and equipment. I want to talk about one item of equipment, the LAV wheeled vehicle. We have an APS&mdash;an armoured personnel carrier&mdash;that goes back to the end of World War II. It is a great vehicle but it is not suited to Australian conditions. If honourable members have travelled on dusty, dirty Australian roads, they would know that conditions are pretty lousy. I would hate to have to get out and fight after I have been shut up in the vehicle for a while. Defence has got a vehicle called the LAV vehicle, which comes from Canada. The trouble is that Canada is in the Northern Hemisphere and it has a cold climate. This vehicle is not designed for our terrain or for our climate. The tyres get thorns in them and they go flat. We have to start to recognise that there is every reason for us to give encouragement to Australian design; we should be able to achieve this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have enough time to go into this, but there is a very good article on how the yanks achieve this. They give money as an incentive to private enterprise. They do it in shipping and in a lot of other ways. I would like to see Australia, in its white paper, accept the fact that we can give a few carrots as incentives to Australian industry to produce designs that can be adopted by the Defence Force. It would add real meaning to our defence exports. It would ensure that we were self-sufficient. The underlying problem in our defence self-sufficiency in 1994 is that nearly every major piece of defence equipment comes from the United States. We rely on it to far too great an extent. I would like us to be self-sufficient in every way, but we are not. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I have never had the opportunity to adequately thank those people who were involved in the development of defence policy for industry that I was responsible for in 1992.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the paper. I think it is a good paper. Because of time limitations I will not be able to talk about all the good things in the paper. Instead, I will raise some issues. Firstly, while I welcome the prominence given to industry in the strategic review, I am really appalled at the lack of reference to the defence, science and technology area and particularly research and development. It is absolutely crazy to think that we can talk about industry capability without talking about the R&amp;D effort that underpins it. I will read from the 1992 paper because I think it highlights the shortcomings or the absences:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be an examination of future management and reporting arrangements for DSTO.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.In consultation with the ADF, industry and other scientific organisations, Defence will develop options for the future management and reporting arrangements for DSTO. This will include examinations of:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the benefits which might result from the introduction of `user pays' and the establishment of DSTO as a statutory authority, or other form of GBE, with its own independent Board of Directors;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.arrangements which might be needed to provide funding for longer term priorities to guard against too great a focus on shorter term needs. . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.the extent to which financial commitment from customers, particularly Defence customers, will translate to better tasking in responsiveness of the DSTO.</PARA>
<PARA>I have hang-ups about a couple of things. I am really hooked on the idea of the importance of research and development, particularly development. I admire the DSTO as being the second largest research institute in Australia. Given the climate of cutbacks in defence funding or where Defence funds so many of the major new initiatives of the government, I felt that the DSTO was really under some threat. We need to look to preserve that R&amp;D capability within DSTO and certainly we need to encourage far more research and development in private enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have taken the view that the best relationship between organisations is that of a customer and client. One cannot really say that about DSTO and Defence. That is why I believe that if the ADF and headquarters have to task the DSTO with dollars we are going to have much better tasking and a much more responsive DSTO. Hence, I frankly favour core funding going to DSTO so that it can continue with a baseline of core and fundamental research, but all other activity must be funded out of ADF or headquarters programs. It is inevitable that it goes that way but there needs to be a decent public discussion about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also think there is a major issue about how quickly one involves industry, and the point at which one involves industry, in taking something from a general research stage into a product development or prototype development stage. One of the criticisms that DSTO has been subjected to is that it tends to hold onto things far too long, although I am the first to acknowledge some of its outstanding achievements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And last but not least is structure. Is it most effective to have the DSTO as a run-of-the-mill program area within Defence or, if one really wants to strengthen this customer relationship, have it in the portfolio area but with an independent and statutory board? That board could really provide some of the business and strategic direction that DSTO may require from time to time and also it may be able to monitor and improve on the relationship between DSTO and its overwhelmingly major client, the ADF. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the suggestions about the opportunities for collaboration have been picked up and I certainly welcome them. I also note that there has been a real change now in the climate of defence exports. Nothing excites me more than the proposal for the Malaysian patrol boats that Transfield started on when I was there and is spearheading it. I would like to publicly acknowledge the role that the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), the department and ADF have taken in getting behind these proposals. It has not been easy to change something that has been done within Australia for many years and adapt it to the requirements of a collaborative effort such that the patrol boats represent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I sincerely hope that they are successful because I believe that it will be very good for Malaysia, given the transfer of technology. It will be exceedingly good for Australia and it will demonstrate with a big bang just how superior some of our capabilities are in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) mentioned design. If there is one criticism of the defence policy in industry it is that it does not tackle the issue of design in a full-blooded way. My only defence is that a person has to pick his timing and, of course, the ADF has had some poor or bad experiences with locally designed products. But in a whole range of areas, and shipbuilding is one of them, we have certainly reached the limits of taking a proven design and building them in Australia. The next logical step is to be involved in design. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many areas Australian industry has the capability. Certainly it is an area that the white paper cannot ignore. I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr Punch) and the minister are already receiving strong suggestions from industry about their capability and about that next step. It will not surprise me to see that as the next major development in what has been a very exciting area; that is, the defence industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said that I would concentrate on a few critical areas. It is very ambitious to suggest that the white paper to be released at the end of the year is going to last for 10 to 15 years. I note that the last white paper did not last anything like that length of time. Probably half of that time is a much more realistic expectation. I do not think we should be embarrassed by the need to regularly review and update. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through the committee that I am pleased to chair, there are some concerns that I hope our report will address, but I want to place on the public record that we are still endorsing, as we should, that the priority for Defence is the defence of Australia. It is a really major statement that focuses very appropriately on defence planners. But having said that, I believe in peacekeeping. Sending a battalion to Somalia has brought about the need for some review, however. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seemed to stretch the resources of the ADF to have a battalion away for such an extended, albeit defined, period. It is conceivable, given credible contingencies, that Australia may need to place a battalion in our north for an extended period, although there is no evident threat. Most Australians would be concerned if we were not able to do that with relative ease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other concern is with regard to our reserves. We say that there are not two armies; that we defend in depth and the reserves have an equal place with the regular army. However, I note that no reservists are ever sent overseas on peacekeeping missions. I do not particularly mind that the reservists play a secondary role, but all I plead is that we should be open with the Australian public. If the reserves are to play a secondary role to the regular army, I think we should say so and change our rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Getting back to Somalia, I note that Professor Dibb has already suggested that, whilst he disagrees with sending the battalion to Somalia, he sees it as quite conceivable that we should send a battalion to our strategic area of interest, that is, in our region, in the future. So the problem of our sustaining a battalion in the field for an extended period as a theoretical proposition is not going to go away. With other committee members, I am raising and want to be informed about this issue of having a 5th battalion. Again, this is an issue that the white paper needs to take up and address very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now have an opportunity to say a couple of really complimentary things. Something that the review reinforces is the terrific effort of defence, civilian and uniform people in building relationships with our ASEAN neighbours. For anyone who has not stumbled on this it comes as a great surprise, as it did to me. But it is of key interest that even when it may go through a difficult period&mdash;as, unfortunately, it may in the relationship between any neighbouring country and Australia&mdash;that defence relationship remains intact. So we should really appreciate and value the fact that Defence is strongly underpinning the initiatives of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and it is adding depth to the quality and quantity of the relationship we have with our neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hope to strengthen even further our defence relationship with Indonesia, but I still do not get the feeling that we have a comprehensive foreign affairs program of developing the Indonesia-Australia relationship in the same way as we have in defence. If I am wrong, I would be very pleased to hear from Mr Costello at Foreign Affairs. It seems to me that Foreign Affairs keeps doing more of the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the popular misconceptions in defence, and this is very much addressed in the paper, is that, with the collapse of the Cold War, Australia has the so-called opportunity to yield a peace dividend. We continually need to remind the Australian public that Australia's defence forces were never structured to meet a cold war threat and therefore, with the collapse of the Cold War, and with the collapse of communism in eastern Europe, there is really no change to our defence posture. As the strategic review suggests, this collapse has added complexities for us in our relationships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that the paper notes that ASEAN countries have done a commendable job in improving dialogue and bilateral and multilateral understanding through their operations, and our region is marked by peace. I am sure all honourable members would hope that that would continue for the foreseeable future but, more importantly, that Australia and its defence forces will be able, with all the good things that they are currently doing, to play a significant role in ensuring that. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the opportunity to make a contribution to the debate on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic review 1993</EMPHASIS> paper, and I do so for a number of reasons. Firstly, my electorate comprises a very large number of retired and returned service people who take an active interest in defence matters and constantly make me aware of their views in the area of defence and defence personnel, and that I appreciate very much. Secondly, my father was a returned serviceman and I took a great interest in his activities as a serviceman during the Second World War. I also have the distinction of being one of the very few veterans remaining in this parliament. So I do take an interest in defence matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition, as has already been stated by the shadow minister for defence, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), broadly supports the thrust of this particular review, although, as the shadow minister said, we have a number of concerns, some of which were expressed very ably by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) in this debate. It probably goes without saying that defence is a key area of government responsibility. It is a very large area of government expenditure, probably almost the largest in the budget, with around $10 billion being spent on defence. The responsibility of ensuring an adequate defence capability for Australia is an important responsibility of government. When people elect governments, one of the things that they expect a government to do is to deliver on that issue, that is, to ensure that Australia does have an adequate defence capability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, as I suggested, a large number of people that take an interest in defence by virtue of the fact that they are former service people. These days there is a greater need than ever to continue to make young people aware of the importance of defence. It is coming up to 50 years now since the end of the Second World War. I was born right at the end of the Second World War and my fiftieth birthday will actually coincide very much with the end of the Second World War; I was born on 3 January 1946.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The younger generation has not experienced directly the importance of defence, and the generation that is growing up behind me did not even go through those years of Australia's direct involvement in the war in Vietnam from about 1965 through till 1972. To some extent this review addresses the need for people, particularly younger people, to be made aware of the importance of defence and of the need to be ready to defend the country should the need arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the world is a volatile place; things change quickly. One only has to read history leading up to both the first and the second world wars to realise how easily a huge war can actually start and how circumstances can suddenly come together to create a conflagration of the extent that occurred then. Of course, all of us would hope&mdash;and pray, indeed&mdash;that there will never be a third world war, but we cannot discount the possibility that there will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many things happening in the world today, not the least what is happening in the former Yugoslavia, where there are all sorts of interests. What makes the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina so difficult to solve is not only that the three main protagonists in Bosnia are fighting, but also that their allies extend into all parts of the Eastern and Western world. That makes a solution to the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina so difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, of course, it shows that the situation in the Balkans has the potential&mdash;and I think the United Nations and the Western nations and, indeed, the Eastern nations are aware of the potential&mdash;to explode beyond the borders of the former Yugoslavia, without any great difficulty at all. Of course, we know that that part of the world was very much a focal point in both the first and second world wars, particularly in the First World War. Many people probably do not realise that the First World War actually began in Sarajevo; and the circumstances surrounding that were, to a large extent at least, unexpected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot afford to be complacent at all about the defence of our country. I would like to believe that we on this side of the House are completely committed to having a strong defence capability. To some extent, we would like to believe that the government had that same commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be very easy, for instance, if one was not vigilant in this area, to say that there was $10 billion going on the defence of the country that could be spent on hospitals and schools and all sorts of other things. There are people in the community who probably take that view. Fortunately, the vast majority of Australians believe that we have to spend money on defence. It is an expensive proposition. It requires not only a large number of personnel&mdash;highly trained, qualified and renumerated personnel&mdash;but also a very high level of equipment; and equipment is something that is changing almost by the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of no use to have a defence force that is not equipped with the latest available equipment. If it is going to be effective, it has to be armed effectively and it has to be supported effectively by the best levels of equipment that are available. It is expensive to defend Australia, to ensure that we have an adequate defence capability. As I say, we on this side of the House strongly support the need for a strong ongoing defence capability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could observe, when talking about the volatility of world events, that the Middle East continues to be an area of great concern. How quickly things can change. A week or two ago, we could see Israel and the PLO getting very close to a rapprochement, a peace&mdash;and not only a peace for Israel, which most of us in this place regard and, certainly speaking for myself, I regard as highly desirable, but a peace that involved a place for the Palestinians to live and call home and a peace in the whole of that region. The Middle East, almost like the former Yugoslavia, is very much a focal point for the future peace of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very desirable that Israel and the PLO accommodate each other. It is also desirable that Syria and the other major protagonists are brought into that arrangement to provide a new era of peace and cooperation in a part of the world which, for all sorts of historical reasons, continues to have problems. Yet we saw a week or so ago one extremist, in the name of the Israeli cause, carry out an horrific mass murder which stalled the process to the extent that it is now badly undermined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to hope and pray that the right pressures are applied to get Israel and the PLO back together again so that they put that terrible event behind them. It is amazing how quickly things can change. It is amazing how unexpected events can suddenly occur; and they can occur just as easily, I believe, in our part of the world. So we need to be ready. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's recent role in peacekeeping forces, which has been alluded to by a number of speakers in this debate, has added a new dimension to the activities of the Australian Defence Force. It is a very valuable and worthwhile dimension. Once again, Australian service personnel have served with great distinction in peacekeeping forces under the auspices of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many such peacekeeping forces are in operation in a number of parts of the world, and some have been operating for many years. The most recent one that comes to mind is the role of the Australians in Cambodia. We can be very proud of the role that we, as Australians, and our service people, as our representatives, have played in Cambodia. They brought a new and, to some extent, unexpected level of peace and stability not only within the borders of Cambodia but also, to some extent, extending beyond that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can also be proud of the fact that the United Nations contingent in Cambodia was commanded so ably by an Australian, Lieutenant-General John Sanderson. Australia gained great kudos from its defence service personnel operating there, and that is something that every Australian can be proud of. Likewise, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) mentioned in particular our contribution in Somalia. Once again, it was a difficult operation, yet it was one that was carried out with distinction by Australians as a part of the United Nations contingent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect of peacekeeping is that it gives to the Australian Defence Force not only an additional dimension but also an additional opportunity to operate in an active theatre, not necessarily of war, but a theatre nevertheless, which may, in some respects, be hostile. It gives our service personnel valuable experience. It adds a level of experience that would prove very valuable in the event of having to serve in a theatre of war in some part of the world. So the opposition supports, and I know the government is committed to, Australia having an ongoing role in United Nations activities around the world. I believe that that is a vital element of modern-day defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a number of concerns about the current operation of the ADF. One that consistently comes up is the current rush into what is quaintly called `downsizing'. It is a pity to see the numbers in the Defence Force falling. On 30 June 1993, the total number of uniformed personnel in the ADF was 91,547, and that continues to trend down. It is a pity, particularly in these times of high unemployment, that that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not suggesting, necessarily, that the ADF is the ideal body to provide employment opportunities, although in many respects it is. It would be politically incorrect, and perhaps a little unpopular, to suggest that national service of some sort should be reintroduced, yet that concept is very popular within the community at large. Not a week goes by that I do not get input from a number of constituents who suggest national service as an obvious way to provide a worthwhile activity for young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand that the ADF does not want to give such an opportunity, nor does it really have a role to do that and nor is it set up to do that. The point is that hardly a week goes by that I do not get a young man or woman coming to me who wants desperately to join the army or the air force, or even the navy, in deference to my colleague the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor). Unfortunately, they are being knocked back; and these are really good quality young Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose that, from the Defence Force perspective at the moment, it is very much a buyers market. That is a pity. When one is approached by a highly qualified young person who really would be ideal as a member of any of the services but who is not able to get in simply because recruiting numbers are down and the services are going about downsizing, it is a great pity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ought to place on record, notwithstanding what I said a moment ago, my ongoing commitment to the concept of national service. I realise, as I also said a moment ago, that it might not be very politically correct to say that but, having been a national serviceman myself and having been conscripted straight out of the gates of university in early 1968 and subsequently going to Vietnam in 1969 through 1970, and speaking for those of us who did that, I can say that it was a wonderful experience. I do not think one would meet many of the two- to three-year national servicemen of my generation that would not say that it was not a very worthwhile experience. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity today to speak on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic review 1993</EMPHASIS> paper. The review is a comprehensive and thorough document that lays the groundwork for defence policy and practices in this nation for the remainder of the century. The review takes into account the enormous and far-reaching changes that have taken place in the strategic relationships throughout the world since the end of the Cold War and suggests avenues through which Australia's defence interests will be served in this new climate of uncertainty in some parts. It is clearly a significant document requiring the careful consideration of the House, and is a useful precursor to the defence white paper due later this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing I would like to say is that this document is the first step in the process of reorganising and adapting our defence and strategic policies to the profound changes in the post-Cold War global security environment. The challenges that this new world order presents to Australia's defence planners are wide ranging and very complex. The thinking that has gone into the strategic review and later the white paper is clearly directed to finding solutions to those challenges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major requirement of any defence policy, of course, is to provide adequately for our own defence. Whilst the strategic review has not identified any particular immediate threat to Australia or our interests, that situation cannot be guaranteed to continue in perpetuity. In particular, the risk that we could be drawn into a regional conflict exists. Our unique geostrategic conditions make the process of preparing the nation for a conflict difficult. For this reason the review has stated quite rightly that the highest priority of defence planning will continue to be the defence of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Providing adequately for the defence of Australia involves a range of initiatives. The review identifies these as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) A national defence capacity to provide for the self-reliant defence of Australia and our interests;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) encouraging the growth of a `regional security community' via cooperative defence relationships with countries in the Asia-Pacific region, but with particular emphasis on South-East Asia;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) continuing the alliance relationship with the United States in a way that will contribute to our national defence capacity and a broader regional security situation; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) continuing our high level of defence commitment to the UN and other multinational operations in order to provide a secure global environment.</PARA>
<PARA>With regard to the first of these initiatives, the national defence capacity, we are presented with unique challenges in developing a force structure for Australia. We have a small Defence Force to defend a very vast area, as we all know. This means that we must draw on the full range of Australia's resources, both military and civilian, to develop the greatest practical combat effectiveness and to respond to rapid changes in strategic imperatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most important functions of the national defence capacity is to enable us to carry out the essential combat and combat related tasks ourselves, as these are the tasks that other countries are least likely to perform on our behalf. This not only meets our goal of self-reliance but also encourages participation of our regional defence partners by demonstrating our willingness to shoulder our part of the security burden. One of these tasks is the provision of adequate warning of a conflict or an immediate threat. I would like to say a few words on this particular issue before moving on to further discussion of the review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must have continuous intelligence information in order to assess the likelihood of a threat to our shores. A general political appraisal is available through our diplomatic sources. However, the review points out the need to preserve our access to the specific intelligence gathering units of the US intelligence community. These include the joint defence facilities in Australia itself. It also points out the need to continue the development of our own intelligence systems and processes on both the diplomatic and technological fronts. With regard to the specific intelligence needs required in the force structure, we must consider capacity to provide early warning of immediate threats. This sort of information will ideally be needed only in times of conflict in the region and should not be regarded as vital in peacetime. However, as the review acknowledges, one of the key requirements of defence capabilities is the ability to collect and evaluate intelligence to support ADF operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two major elements of our forces that have a capacity for continually gathering intelligence about force movements are the four RF111Cs of the RAAF, at Amberley in my electorate, and the RAN submarines. At present, these facilities can provide adequate surveillance of our territory, but some suggestions that might come up in the white paper are worth mentioning. At present, we have a good capability for surveillance of the northern approaches to Australia, utilising the 20 P3C Orion aircraft of the RAAF. Theoretically, these aircraft are capable of observing some 7.8 million square kilometres each day. I say `theoretically' because at the present they are not used this way, for several reasons. Firstly, the present system of surveillance is quite adequate in peacetime and the current policy of the Defence Force is to use scarce resources like the Orions for higher priorities such as training in the joint anti-submarine operations of the ADF. Another reason is that the navy carries out a lot of surveillance of the oceans to our north and in the south-west Pacific. In the event of a major escalation of capacity, the navy's resources would theoretically cover about 500,000 square kilometres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An encouraging development over the last few years has been the opening up of our military training facilities to the military personnel of those countries in our region. Some nations, like Fiji, have been represented in our training institutes for many years, but the availability of our air force training facilities, for example, to pilots from Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia is a development very much in the vein of the strategic review. In fact, a contingent of Singaporean F4 pilots undertook flight training and participated in an exercise with RAAF personnel at Amberley in my electorate of Oxley in 1991. It was only in the last couple of weeks that I had the opportunity to meet some defence personnel from Papua New Guinea, Malaysia and New Zealand who were actually at the college here in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will make a few points about Papua New Guinea following on from what the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) had to say earlier. You may recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I had the opportunity last year to lead a parliamentary delegation to some South Pacific islands&mdash;Micronesia and the Marshall Islands, Western Samoa and Tonga&mdash;and Papua New Guinea was included in that trip. When we talk about relations with Papua New Guinea, I agree wholeheartedly with the right honourable member for New England about the relationship that we need to develop and have prosper. One of the recommendations of the report of that delegation, which I tabled in the parliament, concerning Papua New Guinea was that we extend the opportunities for our parliamentary committees to have exchange visits to Papua New Guinea similar to the relationship we have with New Zealand. I have actually written to the Speaker in that regard. I am encouraged by the response I got from the Speaker. He is to get back to me again but he thinks it is a good idea. He is going to pursue it with the government to see whether the government will support such a proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to suggest that the government should support the proposal, because Papua New Guinea is our very close neighbour and the long and historic relationships we have had with Papua New Guinea are very important for us in keeping stability in our region. I met two gentlemen from Papua New Guinea the other week. I had not met them before. I just happened to see them at a particular venue I was at. I went and spoke to them. It was at about the same time that the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea was visiting here. Interestingly enough, they remembered our delegation going to Papua New Guinea, so we already had that relationship before we started. I can only agree with the right honourable member for New England that it was important that we went up there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to turn to the question of patrol boats. On that particular delegation visit, we had the opportunity in a number of places to actually see first-hand the success of the patrol boats that we had supplied to various nations. Of course, there is a particular section in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic review 1993</EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> </EMPHASIS>report that refers specifically to the south-west Pacific area, and it talks about our near neighbours in New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and the other Pacific island countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) had had the opportunity to visit those countries earlier, to see for himself how successful those boats were. I mentioned the Orion aircraft before, and I understand that the Orion actually does visit some of those parts from time to time and does a lot of surveillance&mdash;from an economic, not so much a military, point of view. They are involved in protecting those islands' waters and their very vital fishing industry. That is a real plus for them. We should take every opportunity to develop these relationships with our neighbours. In my view, that is what this strategic review is all about. As we continue to develop things like APEC and the ASEAN region, it is only by working closely with our neighbours that we will always have a peaceful area to live in. Of course, the immediate Pacific region is of importance from that point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect of the report is civilian and military coordination. The honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) earlier mentioned the role of DSTO, and that there should have been more emphasis placed on DSTO in the report. Coverage of industry is somewhat lacking in this report, although one chapter touches on it. Only last week, as I am sure the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) will recall from one of the committees we are involved in, we had the opportunity to meet with a representative from ADI, Australian Defence Industries. Its good work is very important for Australia in developing industries in military and civilian areas. This is one of the success stories of our Australian industries, and there are many others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) earlier mentioned personnel. There is no doubt that the Department of Defence employs a lot of people. In my own electorate of Oxley, a lot of people are employed at the RAAF base in Amberley. We claim that they are the largest employer in our area now, even though there are a lot of other industries with significant numbers of employees. But some of the traditional industries, such as mining and transport, do not employ the numbers of people they used to in the past. Defence industries and the role of civilians are an area on which there could be greater focus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through the civilianisation process, more and more civilians are now employed in the defence area. As well, a lot of service personnel who retire at a reasonably early age are returning to work in a civilian capacity in the defence forces. If anything is going to change as a result of the white paper, we should encourage a greater emphasis on industry itself because there is a great potential for people to operate in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to focus not only on our own region. Australia plays a very important role in all parts of the world, particularly through our involvement in the various peacekeeping forces of the United Nations. The honourable member for Chifley mentioned our role in Somalia, and there are other important areas that we need to look at as well. In chapter 2 of the report there is some emphasis on global security, and Australia has a very important part to play in helping to maintain that. As a peace loving people, we need to focus more on that.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The global aspect of security in the changing world today is extremely important for us and I hope that through the white paper process we will see greater emphasis on that than there is already. With regard to industry, I encourage those people participating in the white paper process to have a good look at the role of Australian Defence Industries, because I was very impressed with the professionalism of Australian Defence Industries. The managing director, Mr Harris, appeared before our committee and talked to us about the things that it is doing, not only here in Australia but throughout the world, and about the high regard in which it is held. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the Amberley air force base in my electorate, the surveillance capability of the F111s is extremely important, as I mentioned earlier, and the defence personnel stationed there also are important. The government has been doing a lot of things to help personnel in the defence forces, including improved housing and a recent change in their salary structures. It is a good opportunity for honourable members of this House to acknowledge the role that our defence personnel play in all parts of the world. The various committees in this parliament often talk to people from the defence area, and we see the professionalism and the expertise that our defence personnel have built up in the world of high technology. I take this opportunity to support the report and all the personnel who work in the defence area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. At the instigation of the coalition, last week this House debated the practice of female genital mutilation. This debate received extensive publicity and was followed by the New South Wales state government announcing plans to outlaw the practice in that state. Since that debate took place a Melbourne court has placed two young girls under a health department supervision order. They have suffered the most extreme form of female genital mutilation. Given the Prime Minister's responsibilities for the status of women, what plans does he have to see an end to this practice in Australia? Will he assure this House that his government will take all necessary steps to ensure that this barbaric practice is outlawed in Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer. I refer to the government's fiscal framework which sets out the government's budgetary strategy for the forthcoming financial year. Is the Treasurer aware of reports that the deficit reduction target is too modest and that a much greater deficit reduction should be achieved? Can the Treasurer advise the House what the implications of such a deficit outcome would be?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1740" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier this week the government released the fiscal framework which set out the government's budget strategy. The government is committed to reducing the deficit from the estimated outcome for this year of around 3 1/2 per cent of GDP to around 1 per cent of GDP by 1996-97. That is our medium-term deficit reduction program. We adhere fully to that program and have committed ourselves to taking credible steps towards that goal in the forthcoming budget, as well as taking some substantial initiatives to address our priority areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have noted that the shadow Treasurer has called for the budget deficit to be reduced to $9 billion or $10 billion; that is, a little over 2 per cent of GDP. He wants to cut the budget deficit in one year by about $5 3/4 billion, from an outcome this year of around $14 3/4 billion to about $9 billion&mdash;a cut of about 1 1/4 per cent of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quickly take the House through the implications of such a policy. Firstly, obviously, a cut of that order would mean a large cut in demand, and that would certainly have an impact on the rate of economic growth unless it was fully supplemented by some other form of increased demand in the economy. But the fact is that the public sector has been, to this stage, providing a substantial degree of impetus to economic growth because of the policies pursued by the government to get us back onto a growth path.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We accept absolutely the need to withdraw that stimulus as the economy recovers, but to do it drastically in very large lumps would run a very great risk of reducing demand by an untoward amount. If 1 1/4 per cent of GDP were cut out of the economy in one hit, we would certainly do that. As a result of that, we would see the economic recovery faltering rather than solidifying and increasing. That would be a quite counterproductive thing for us to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all want business investment to take off. The argument from the opposition is that this policy would assist business investment because it would help with interest rates. Interest rates at the present time are at their lowest level for 20 years. What is important for business investment is not just interest rates being low and remaining low and having low inflation but also that there is sufficient demand for the products that business produces from increased investment. If there is not the demand, obviously the investment will not come. So the opposition's policy is right over the top. It would certainly be damaging to economic growth and economic recovery and, with that, damaging to employment growth. We need higher rates of economic growth in order to get higher employment growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth considering how the opposition would achieve such a reduction. It has ruled out completely any increases in taxes; therefore, one can only make such savings by cutting government expenditure. The cuts in government expenditure which would be involved would be horrendous. The starting point for the deficit for this forthcoming year is likely to be in the vicinity of $13 billion. To get down to $9 billion would mean cutting government outlays by about $4 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth the House taking note of the fact that that is a bigger cut in outlays than was proposed in Fightback in year one&mdash;even in its mark 1 version, which involved $3.9 billion in gross expenditure cuts. The honourable member is talking about net expenditure cuts. But, in terms of gross cuts in Fightback, it was $3.9 billion&mdash;just under $4 billion. In Fightback mark 2, that was reduced to $3.2 billion. In net terms, the effect on the deficit was zero, because the opposition increased some other expenditures and had some tax cuts to offset it. So there was no impact on the deficit at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is saying that we should be doing vastly more on the deficit than it proposed to do under Fightback mark 1. Presumably, this means that the honourable member for Mayo now thinks that the honourable member for Flinders was a wimp when he was the shadow Treasurer, because he was pursuing this softy old policy of cutting expenditure by only $3 billion in gross terms and then offsetting it in other ways and not reducing the deficit. He is a real wimp compared with the honourable member for Mayo, who apparently thinks he has to prove himself to be ultra hairy-chested.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth reminding the House very briefly of the sorts of things that were involved in cutting expenditure by these levels. Remember how the opposition was going to cut out the jobsearch allowance after nine months in Fightback mark 1? It eventually dumped that. It was going to reduce the budgets of the ABC and the SBS by 10 per cent; cut public housing expenditure by $100 million; cut Aboriginal affairs expenditure by $82 million; cut foreign aid by $154 million; cut pensions to sole parents by $30 million; and cut funds to the states by $700 million. I hope the state premiers remember that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition was going to force the unemployed to run down their liquid assets before providing the jobsearch allowance to save $150 million. In fact, it had a whole swathe of attacks on the unemployed. It was going to reduce their benefits by hundreds of millions of dollars and cut outlays on labour market programs. In the forthcoming budget, we will certainly increase expenditure on labour market programs to address the position of the long-term unemployed even more than we have in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition wanted in Fightback to cut expenditure on labour market programs. It had a whole program of attacks on the unemployed. That is the sort of thing that it was prepared to do to get cuts in the order of $3.9 billion or $3 billion. We will not be making those sorts of cuts. We will certainly be addressing the need to have tight expenditures, but we will not be pursuing that kind of course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It shows that the implications of the opposition's policy are a lower level of economic and employment growth and higher unemployment. It is a great attack on social justice in this economy. Yet the honourable member for Mayo, when asked what his philosophy was, described it in these somewhat unsophisticated terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We hang out in common ground where sensible people hang out.</PARA>
<PARA>These are the sorts of policies that he reckons sensible people support. All I can say is that, if he reckons they are the policies that sensible people support, thank God he is not pursuing policies that lunatic Right people support.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is again directed to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister will be aware that over the years prime ministers and ministers on both sides of politics have been questioned about possible conflicts between their business affairs and their public duties. In this context, the Prime Minister will recall that in 1978 he made a scathing attack on Phillip Lynch, concerning some of his business transactions. The Prime Minister justified doing so because, in his own words at the time, `the former Treasurer's personal affairs are in the marketplace of politics'. In view of the fact that the Prime Minister is engaging in a business venture which, by any measure, is major and which, in terms of borrowings, is unprecedented by any Prime Minister, will he provide sufficient information on his business affairs to satisfy the Australian people that there is no conflict or appearance of conflict between his private business interests and his public duties as Prime Minister?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I recall it, the former Treasurer&mdash;and I do not want to go over that affair&mdash;was involved with zoning issues, local government approvals and other things which were matters of investigation. The reason the Leader of the Opposition seems to be interested in this subject is the amount of information which is made available, first, by my disclosure in the House that I have a business interest and, second, by the publication of annual accounts to the Australian Securities Commission.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government, in its statement on 15 February, recognised the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Senator Evans pointed out in his statement on 15 February announcing Australia's recognition that all three conditions that I set had now been met. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the use of the word `Macedonia' being settled in a way that does not cause further tension with Greece . . . while the name issue has not been finally resolved . . . the international community (including Greece itself)&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>for United Nations purposes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">accepting the temporary use of the name `Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia'.</PARA>
<PARA>In recognising states, we have met the objectives that we normally lay down: permanent population, defined territory, government in effective control, capacity to enter relations with other countries. Fifty-eight other countries, including the United States and all Greece's European Union partners, have also recognised the republic. FYROM's membership under that name, as I said, was co-sponsored by Greece. That co-sponsoring by Greece made widespread international recognition inevitable&mdash;a point recognised by the shadow minister for foreign affairs, who on 15 February acknowledged:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's decision to recognise FYROM as an independent state was consistent with that state's membership of the United Nations.</PARA>
<PARA>That was correct. The government also needed to take into account its responsibilities to the roughly 75,000 Australians from the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, including difficulties caused by their lack of access to appropriate consular facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recognising FYROM we have taken steps to address legitimate concerns expressed both by Greece and by the Greek community in Australia. Our recognition of FYROM, as with our recognition of any state, does not imply any Australian judgment about its policies. Indeed, we have publicly urged FYROM to assist negotiations with Greece by addressing a number of Greek concerns, amongst them ceasing to use disputed symbols on its flag, not using the name `Republic of Macedonia' and addressing concerns about its constitution. In July 1992, in part because Australia failed to recognise or was not prepared to recognise that state then, it amended its constitution, spelling out that that country `has no territorial pretensions towards any neighbouring states', together with President Gligorov's restatement, most recently on 10 February, of Skopje's acceptance of existing boundaries between the two countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the step of changing the constitution, not recognising the state as the Republic of Macedonia and making it clear that we dispute the use of the Star of Vergina in the flag, we have done the things which are consistent with the concerns expressed by the Australian Labor Party about any attempts by the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to represent itself in some way as part of Greece or Greek interests. It is fully consistent with the principles I laid out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can I also add that recognition of FYROM is different from establishment of diplomatic relations which involves setting up of diplomatic missions. We have yet to begin negotiations with FYROM on the establishment of diplomatic relations. I remind the House that we made our agreement to the opening of a FYROM consulate in Australia conditional on it describing itself appropriately as the consulate of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, not Macedonia, and not displaying any contentious flag or other symbol pending resolution of these and other issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned about recent incidents involving community facilities used by Greek Australians and by Australians from the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. I urge both communities to show restraint. In this regard I welcome calls by community leaders for calm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attitude of most community leaders is contrasted with the dangerous and self-serving posturing of our opponents. Outrageous statements such as Mr Kennett's reference at a Melbourne rally to the `final betrayal of the Greek community' do him no credit and are a provocation to community unrest. His remarks constitute an assault on the traditions of tolerance and community cooperation on which our society is based. Need I make the obvious point that a state premier is not involved in the issue of diplomatic relations? Therefore, he took the running on the issue because, after the statement had been made by the honourable member for Kooyong&mdash;properly, in my view&mdash;the federal opposition was in no position to make remarks of the kind made by Mr Kennett.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only say this: Australia's multicultural society depends on all members of the community having tolerance and respect for the positions of others. There is a state involved here. It happens to be a poor state, a poverty ridden state, a small state. Small though it is, it has no rights to expropriate the symbols of Greece or to try to represent itself in some way as the government or republic of Macedonia. We made that very clear. In the course of making it clear, in the two intervening years it has led to this constitutional change about recognition of other people's territory; it has led to Greece sponsoring this state for entry to the United Nations as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; and it has also led to an international view that this state should not represent itself with the Star of Vergina and other things which are peculiarly Greek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should think that from the point of view of the Greek community, the pressure which Australia, amongst others, has exerted internationally has brought about this change which should suit the attitudes of the people of Greece and also Australians of Greek origin. As with most things like this, one should look at the objective facts notwithstanding the obvious emotionalism of these issues and, on the part of Greek Australians, conclude that progress was made in this issue; that there is a state there; and that the principles of recognition of the state have to be observed and were observed by 58 countries, including the United States of America. Australia so recognising this state, after Greece sponsored it to the United Nations, is, I think, a defensible recognition by Australia of a state notwithstanding the interests that the government has in the people of Greece and in Australians of Greek descent.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, again this has absolutely nothing to do with my ministerial responsibility&mdash;absolutely and completely nothing. I think that by and large the Australian banking system has played a fairly constructive role over the last few years with agricultural properties in seeing that people have not been driven off farms, that they have been able to see them come back into full production, particularly after bad seasons, extend their indebtedness and become viable units again into the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The project to which the honourable gentleman refers is about building a major new business for Australia, something that now does not exist. It will take the technology of the world's leading producer of this material and marry it to the natural comparative advantage of Australia. It is unbelievable for the country party, the National Party, to be cavilling at the building of a major agricultural enterprise. It is because of that, obviously, that there is the opportunity to exploit the Australian and international markets in this product. It is not in the position of a farm which is dealing in one commodity, which does not process or add value and it is not in a position to be compared with this project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other elements of the question I am not aware of, but let me quote the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Land</EMPHASIS> newspaper, rather than the honourable member's local newspaper. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal opposition is risking losing further support among its constituents if it keeps up its unconstructive attack on the Prime Minister over his involvement in the Parkville piggery at Scone. In recent weeks Mr Keating has been grilled unrelentingly over aspects of the piggery group's financial structure and the environmental implications.</PARA>
<PARA>Can I just say this about the environmental implications: the Leader of the National Party was on radio this week in Brisbane saying what a dreadful thing it was that a piggery with 68,000 pigs and the excrement which it produces would be a problem nine kilometres from the city of Scone when he has in his electorate a piggery of 250,000 pigs four kilometres from Corowa&mdash;250,000 pigs, the largest piggery in Australia, the largest in the southern hemisphere, four times the size of the one that he attacks, which will build up over five years&mdash;half the distance from the city of Corowa as this project is from the city of Scone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet we have had this supposed leader of rural interests out there on the highways and byways decrying the fact that a new rural enterprise which Australia does not have, which would give it a position in the white meat industry of Asia, attacking it for its by-products, when in his own electorate he has a business four times as large and half the distance from the city in which it is located.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a long forgotten saying of the 1970s: Mr H. Bug&mdash;Mr Hum Bug. The Leader of the National Party has in his electorate a piggery four times as large. The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Voters have every right to ask what it is that the coalition, supposedly the ideological stronghold of free enterprise, finds so distasteful about a Prime Minister having an interest in a commercial pig meat business. People have argued that a conflict of interest could arise by virtue of the Prime Minister's ability to influence policies affecting its profitability . . . but surely similar arguments could have been levelled against former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser who was and remains heavily involved in wool production, and&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>need I say&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Anthony, who had at the time the largest loan from the Commonwealth Bank in establishing his piggery in the 70s.</PARA>
<PARA>I think the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Land</EMPHASIS> sums it up. If the National Party wants any relevance in this country, it should at least stick to its last about the rural industry and that industry's place in the Australian agricultural scene. If the Leader of the National Party with the hypocrisy of his statements believes that the product of a piggery a quarter the size of the one in his electorate is a problem, what is he doing? What has he said to Bunges in Corowa about its output? What has he done about the smells and odours from the Corowa piggery, which is half the distance from Corowa that the Scone piggery is from Scone? I think he has to answer those questions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of initiatives which were started last year and which will shortly come to fruition will be of particular interest to Australian women. Honourable members may recall that early last year the Australian Law Reform Commission was given a reference regarding women and equity before the law. Later today the first interim report of the Law Reform Commission will be tabled in this parliament. This report canvasses the position of women and the Australian legal system. Its major recommendation is for the establishment of a national women's justice program. This program envisages a review of the operations of aspects of the legal system such as the legal aid system, the way in which community legal centres operate, as well as practical matters such as the barriers women face in accessing courts. These barriers include the lack of adequate child-care facilities in Australian courts and inappropriate waiting rooms to make sure that the victims of violence and the perpetrators are separated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members would also be aware that the Australian Institute of Judicial Administration received a grant from the government to commence the development of programs on gender awareness for the judiciary and other members of Australian courts.

We have had very strong support from all Australian jurisdictions and all Australian courts for this program, as we had with the cultural awareness programs following the setting up of such a program as a result of one of the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Black Deaths in Custody. Indeed, this morning I held discussions with the chief justice of the Family Court about the program which that court is operating.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Minister for Communications and the Arts reminds me, Italy, amongst other countries, is moving away from proportional representation. I would not have thought that the simple presence of a voting system would mean that we have some sort of holy grail about representation. Let us not mix words about the Senate. It is no longer a states house. It is not a states house; it is a party house. It has an equal number of senators for the principal reason of protecting small states against the large states in the early days of Federation when the revenue of the then states or colonies was to be directed maybe to the larger states at their detriment. That check and balance was put in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That condition has long passed. We now have national budgets. There is no notion of that kind of representation in the House of Representatives voting appropriations to the large states. It is simply a party house. Worse than that, it is now a party house which throws up members who cannot get themselves more than two, three or four per cent of the vote. I would not have thought, if you put yourself up as an Democrat, you would have found something alien about the concept of getting 50 per cent plus one somewhere, even if it was through preferences. The notion is that somebody can try to usurp executive authority with three or four per cent of the vote. Remember that governments are formed in the representative chamber, the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Has the Liberal Party taken leave of its senses on this matter in not understanding where the weight and fulcrum of our democracy are? It is in the representative chamber. That is where there are roughly equal numbers of electors across the country and we have an election where every person's vote is equal. But in the Senate a person's vote in a small state is not the equal of a person's vote in a big state. It is unrepresentative and, because it operates as a party house and now a spoiling chamber, it is in fact usurping the responsibilities of the executive drawn from the representative chamber, the House of Representatives.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Notwithstanding your point, Mr Speaker, let me just make this clear to the honourable gentleman: he knows, but he would not have the decency to say it, that this was a business that the Commonwealth Bank gave loans to&mdash;very large loans&mdash;years before I took an interest in it. In the event that those properties had gone on the market in the recession, the bank would have got very little for them and would have suffered massive losses. To have had the prospect of that business joining a major international partner, the world leader, in a new business must have been music to the ears of the Commonwealth Bank.</PARA></TALK.START>

It finished the 1980s in superlative condition, with a high stock market price, with the State Bank of Victoria as a new institution.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Consumer Affairs. Has the minister's attention been drawn to a statement by the Australian Consumers Association headed `New Banking Code&mdash;good for banks, bad for consumers'? Is this assertion correct? Is it still intended that the Australian Payments System Council will monitor the operation of the code, as the government announced last year? If so, can the minister advise whether or not the Australian Payments System Council can protect consumers' interests adequately, especially in the light of the criticism of the council monitoring system published in the latest edition of the Australian Consumers Association's own journal, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Consuming Interest</EMPHASIS>?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZH4">Ms McHUGH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Forde for that question. I did see the article. It had quite a cute headline, but of course it was totally wrong. The Australian banking code of practice is an extremely important first step for consumers. It will provide consumers with better privacy and more information; it will ensure an efficient and fair dispute resolution mechanism; and it will ensure that documentation is in plain language. Best of all, the banks have agreed to be bound by the code. That means that when it is in operation it will be enforceable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our task in government is to make sure that the code works. The key to this is the monitoring of the code. The government has publicly stated that it is committed to the Australian Payments System Council, the APSC, doing the monitoring. It will get information from the banks. The banks will provide information to the Reserve Bank. The APSC, if it considers it appropriate, can also get information from the wider community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The APSC is administered by the Reserve Bank and has representatives from the banks and from consumers. It has continuous oversight of the code, and it will provide a full report to the Treasurer within three years. The APSC has set up a subcommittee which is now working on details of how this will operate. That subcommittee comprises two consumer representatives, two bank representatives and the chair of the APSC. It is preparing a full questionnaire for the banks, which will ask for very detailed information on each individual aspect of the code&mdash;for example, privacy, disclosure of information, and guarantees. The subcommittee has nearly finished its work and will report to the full APSC later this month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say again that the negative, cynical attitude displayed in that article gets us absolutely nowhere. The monitoring is the key to all of this. We take it very seriously. The press release that was put out by the then Treasurer and me at the time made absolutely clear how important the monitoring was. That monitoring will pick up any problems. The government will then see whether anything more has to be done.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Crime Authority's current investigations cover the spectrum of organised crime, including drug trafficking, fraud, murder, extortion, illegal gambling, money laundering and bribery and corruption. In 1993-94, to date, courts have made orders, including forfeiture and pecuniary penalties, worth $152 million. One of those orders was made against Mr Ian Saxon for $69.2 million and is the largest pecuniary penalty ever issued. More than $12 million has been recouped this year to date and been paid into the confiscated assets trust fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far this year, 64 people have been charged with 193 offences in the course of national task force investigations. That compares with 41 people charged with 206 offences over the last financial year, and demonstrates the increasing effectiveness of the National Crime Authority's cooperative national investigations. In addition, 34 people have been charged directly by the NCA with 125 offences. The National Crime Authority's intelligence assessments are making valuable contributions to all law enforcement agencies' knowledge of organisations involved in organised criminal activity.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to start this discussion of matter of public importance by sharing with the House some of the tactical thoughts of the opposition during question time today. I have to say to you, Mr Speaker, as you leave, that we felt a tinge of disappointment when you gave the call to the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) rather than to me. I do not contest your decision&mdash;I am always duly respectful&mdash;but we felt a tinge of disappointment because, as the House was later to learn, I was rather keen to ask the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) a question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that disappointment we felt in your giving the call to the honourable member for North Sydney rapidly dissolved as the Prime Minister indulged himself in one of his favourite pastimes; that is, unloading on the Senate and unloading on the rights of the less populous states to be equally represented in the Senate via the existing voting arrangements. We wanted the Prime Minister to go on and on. I said to my colleague the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge) as the Prime Minister went on, `I hope all the radio sets in Fremantle are turned on as they listen to question time this afternoon'. If ever there was a prime ministerial plan which was a lethal dagger aimed at the heart of these less populous states' representation in the Senate it would be his plan to radically alter the voting system for the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could not believe my ears. We collectively in the opposition could not believe our good fortune today when the Prime Minister unloaded himself once again. He really does hate the Senate. He really does regard the Senate as unrepresentative swill. The thing he hates most about the federal Senate came out today: he hates the fact that there are the same number of Western Australians in the Senate as there are people from New South Wales. He really hates that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to those people who are going to be casting their votes in the Fremantle by-election that the Prime Minister has really put federalism at the top of the agenda as far as that by-election is concerned. I wonder what the attitude of the Labor candidate, the former premier of Western Australia, is to the Prime Minister's plan to slash Western Australia's representation in federal parliament, because that is what he wants to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister wants to reduce the number of Western Australians in federal parliament. He said on Brisbane radio yesterday, `Isn't it outrageous that 400,000 Tasmanians have the same number of senators as the people from New South Wales?'. Does the Prime Minister not know enough about the history of Australia to understand that, had it not been for the equal representation in the Senate of all the states at the time of Federation, there would never have been a Federation? Does he not know that a crucial element of the federal compact was the notion of single member electorates for the House of Representatives and an equality of representation in the Senate? Anybody who knows the first thing about Australian history would know that, but that does not include the Prime Minister. The only contact the Prime Minister has with Australian history is when he rewrites it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister described Adam Smith as a 19th century robber baron when in fact he was an 18th century Scottish moral philosopher, he described the Malayan peninsula of 1941 as Malaysia and he did not know when Captain Cook first came to Australia; so I suppose we could not expect him to know anything about the constitutional history of Australia. But a lot of people in Western Australia know a lot about Western Australia's role in the Federation. A lot of people know perfectly well that, if the equality of representation from all of the states is undermined&mdash;in other words, the states have an equal number of senators in the federal Senate, not more for the big states and fewer for the smaller states&mdash;that is fundamentally altering the original federal compact. It is betraying the basis on which states such as Western Australia enter the Federation. It is as simple as that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no way on earth that this Prime Minister can escape the odium of that argument. What he said about Tasmania on Brisbane radio yesterday was compounded by the remarks he made today. It was the most scornful, arrogant, contemptuous attack on the equal treatment of the states in the Senate, which is the essence of the federal compact, that I have ever heard from an Australian Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no argument at all with the Prime Minister's view that we should have a strident national spirit. We on this side of the House are as good nationalists as those on the opposite side of the House. The great difference between us is that we are not centralists. There is a difference between nationalism and centralism. Nationalism looks to the overall interests of the nation; centralism is the automatic assumption that a decision made in Canberra is always better than a decision made in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Adelaide or Brisbane. That man who, regrettably, sits at the dispatch box in question time on two out of four occasions is a dyed-in-the-wool centralist. He could not restrain himself today. It all just came pouring out. We know what a strident centralist he has been over the last 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all remember how much the Prime Minister cared for the interests of Western Australia when the Mabo legislation was being put together. We also know how much he cared for the interests of Tasmania when, as a member of the Hawke government, he overrode the legitimate interests of that state on numerous occasions. Most of all, we know how he deliberately set out, when campaigning for the leadership of the Labor Party, to torpedo the one authentic attempt that has been made over the last 10 years to improve the quality of federal-state relations. That was the attempt made by Bob Hawke&mdash;nobly supported by the then Liberal Premier of New South Wales, Nick Greiner, who as a true Australian nationalist was prepared to put the interests of Australia ahead of any narrow provincial interest and who was prepared to support the federalism push of the Prime Minister of Australia at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But who set out to destroy it? Who wandered around in the caucus room and nobbled Hawke's attempt to bring a bit of sanity to federal-state relations? It was none other than the honourable member for Blaxland, the now Prime Minister of Australia. He did not care about the national interests. He was not interested in decent federalism. What did the honourable member for Swan, the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), do to defend Mr Hawke? He did absolutely nothing. The present Prime Minister just pushed the former Prime Minister aside and he torpedoed that one decent attempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the Prime Minister has wrecked any hope of a decent restoration of federalism, he now has the unbelievable gall to try to pose as some kind of born-again believer in federalism. He went running off to the COAG meeting in Tasmania last week saying, `I believe in competition, provided I do not have to be in the race and provided the trade union movement does not have to be in the race'. The Prime Minister says, `Lawyers, accountants, state electricity authorities and state water authorities have to compete but, gee, you can't ask the ACTU to compete, that is unfair; you've got to draw the line somewhere. Asking unions to compete? Break it down; you can't do that'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did the Prime Minister do with the help of his mate, the Minister for Industrial Relations, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton)? He put a bill through this parliament, including the federal Senate, that reduces the exposure of the trade union movement in Australia to competition. So lawyers, accountants and electricity authorities go in one direction and trade unionists go in the other. The Prime Minister believes that that is fair. That is a nice, decent place to live in&mdash;Keating style. It is a pretty odd set of priorities and it stamps him as a politician of rank hypocrisy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of that could possibly equal what has come out of the mouth of the Prime Minister over the last couple of days on the question of Senate representation. Do honourable members know what these characters want to do with the Senate? They want to destroy the notion of a senator representing an entire state. For 93 years, even though we had a voting change in 1949, when we went from simple preferential to proportional representation, we have always had the notion that a senator represents the whole state. What they have in mind now is not only to reduce the number of senators from Western Australia and Tasmania&mdash;everybody mark my words: the Prime Minister's plan says fewer senators from Western Australia&mdash;but also to have senators in future elected not on the basis of representing a state but on the basis of representing a region or an area of the country. The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) nods his head in assent. That is what they really want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two things have come out of this little exercise by the Prime Minister. If those opposite have their way, there will no longer be senators from New South Wales, Victoria or Western Australia. There will be senators from the Riverina, western Sydney, the North Shore, the great south-west and North Queensland. They really want to alter the fundamental nature of the federal compact, yet they try to pretend that they have a minimalist republic in mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every time we scratch the surface, the maximalist Prime Minister comes oozing out. He cannot help himself. Old motormouth runs away at the mouth. He thinks he is clever. He looks around to the boys and girls behind him and they cheer him on. He does not realise that he is just running off at the mouth. He did it in true grand style today. We could not believe our luck that he was going to dump as much as he did. In the process, he underlined yet again what a radical centralist he really is. Regardless of how he dresses himself up, he is about radical constitutional change. He goes quiet for a couple of months. Those opposite got onto him and said, `Look, Paul, every time you speak in favour of the republic, the support for it goes down in the polls; so please keep quiet'. They shut him up for a while, but he breaks out again. He reveals that he is very much about radical change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There are a lot of people in Australia who believe that in a country as big as Australia we need to have a nationalistic approach and the true national interest must always take priority over provincial interests. I will never argue anything else because I am an unapologetic Australian nationalist. The truth of the matter is that the national interest is not always synonymous with Canberra. It is not always synonymous with the decisions of a central government. The national interest often is to disperse and divide power. That is what our constitution was built on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would never have had an Australian federation if we had not had equality of representation in the Senate. It is as simple as that. Yet the Prime Minister has a dagger aimed at that. I hope every voter in Fremantle and every person in Western Australia who cares about a dispersal of power understands what the current Prime Minister is all about. He is about busting that original essence of the federal compact. He is about abolishing the Senate if he could get away with it. He is about having a much reduced federal structure in this country. He is about reducing the number of senators from the less popular states in the federal Senate and he is still very much about centralising power in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the political commentators have talked about the Labor Prime Ministers over the last 20 years they got it right when they have compared Paul Keating not with Bob Hawke but with Gough Whitlam. I notice once again the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), who is becoming my resident tutor on Labor Party folklore on these things&mdash;and I am very grateful for that&mdash;is nodding again. On these things the Prime Minister is very much like Whitlam. Whitlam wanted to destroy to states. Whitlam wanted to have 25 regions. Whitlam wanted to have a strong central government and to alter the federal compact and this bloke is exactly the same. Mark my words, the Prime Minister is about destroying the power of the federal Senate. He is about tearing up the original federal compact and there is no part of Australia that has more to lose from that than the people of Western Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me set the mind of the Manager of Opposition Business in the House (Mr Howard) at rest immediately. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is not talking about changing the balance of representation between the states. That is not something that is  in  his  gift,  it  would  require  a  referendum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister is talking about the system of election, with equally based representation between the states. The issue he has referred to is whether or not the 12 senators from New South Wales and the 12 senators from Western Australia should continue to be elected by proportional representation or whether they should be elected by a preferential system such as in the House of Representatives. The Prime Minister is not talking about altering the balance between the states in Senate representation, and nor can he. The claim that he has put in place, that somehow or other Western Australia's power would be affected, is a piece of nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to have a discussion about whether or not proportional representation within that framework or first-past-the-post voting would necessarily diminish the power of the small states&mdash;if honourable members want to look at it in that context&mdash;we would have to go to a reasonable analysis of what the performance has been electorally in the small states over the last 20 years or at least within the living memory of people in this chamber. Whatever else those opposite might say about it, and whatever agreements or disagreements they might have with the process of elections, the one thing they could not say is that the smaller states' influence would be diminished; in all likelihood it would be increased. The small states with the more simple socioeconomic divisions than the large ones have tended to manifest much more emphatic election results than has been the case in either Victoria or New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia at different times the Labor Party has been virtually wiped out and at other times the Liberal Party has come quite close to it. In Queensland the Labor Party was frequently quite effectively wiped out but more recently has done a great deal better than that. The major states have not had the same split as the smaller states where the balance of representation has tended to be much more equal. Oddly enough, if we take New South Wales and Western Australia, the last result in New South Wales would be likely to have produced, in its 12 senators, a seven to five split on single member constituencies; in Western Australia it probably would have produced a nine to three or a 10 to two split in the Liberals' favour. If we look at the result in those terms and we add the New South Wales and Western Australian results together we would find that there would be a majority of Labor Party votes, but they were actually outweighed in the Senate voting outcome by dividing the chamber up in that way. That would be the potential consequence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could make many arguments around the proposition that we ought to have direct election for senators to make them responsible to constituents and not have a PR system associated with it, but one argument we cannot make about it is whether or not it impacts on the smaller states. That is an outcome which is completely irrelevant to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of federation the states focused not so much on the equality between the states in the Senate, though that was important to them, but on the nexus between the Senate and the House of Representatives. There has been one effort to change that nexus by a constitutional referendum&mdash;a change in the constitution instigated by the Liberal Party, but which the Labor Party supported at the time. It was argued against it at the time correctly&mdash;though I do not think correctly in terms of an outcome desired&mdash;that the nexus had been important in the original federation compact to the small states in agreeing to enter into that compact. The Liberal Party at the time tried to change that nexus. On that particular occasion the Liberal Party, in advocating that course of action, found no difficulty with what it now describes as centralist principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The harum-scarum, fearsome consequence that the Manager of Opposition Business was going into on this, I simply cannot comprehend. I can see an argument around whether or not we ought to have direct elections and PR, but an argument that, somehow or other, what the Prime Minister proposes diminishes in any way the authority of the Senate as a states' house, the impact of the states, I think is just absolute and complete nonsense. I cannot fathom where he gets his argument from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be delighted, however, for members of the opposition to pay a little more serious attention to the issues of democracy which they believe they uphold. There is only one corrupt electoral system left in the entirety of this country: the electoral system in Western Australia, which is the subject of this motion. That electoral system is fiendishly corrupt. It is so fiendishly corrupt that it was a matter of scandal before the Western Australian royal commission. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This electoral review&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, changing the boundaries to remove the malapportionment&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is central and of vital importance to the recommendations of the Commission. Through our committee proposals, through the inquisitorial powers we consider the Parliament should have, but, most importantly, through the independent parliamentary agencies, the Commission's recommendations, if implemented, would arm the Parliament, and particularly the Council, with formidable powers of inquiry and scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Their capacity to serve that role will depend substantially on a Parliament so structured and motivated as to be able to share their objectives and fully support them in their respective tasks.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well might the Western Australian royal commission have drawn attention to the corruption supported by the Liberal Party in Western Australia of those electoral boundaries. Virtually all the royal commission's recommendations brought down for the processes of government to prevent corruption have been rejected by the Court administration in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So that honourable members know where the opposition comes from, this is what they produce. In the various legislative council regions this is the result: in the north metropolitan region, enrolment per member is 41,000 and it is about the same in the south metropolitan region and the east metropolitan region; in the south-west region, outside the metropolitan area, it is one for 15,000; it is one for 16,000 in the agricultural region; and it is one for 12,000 in the mining and pastoral region. Those opposite might say, `Oh well, that is the Legislative Council, it is not the House in which the government is formed'. So perhaps we should tolerate corruption in the Legislative Council!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we move over to the Legislative Assembly, where the government is formed. We find this: in the metropolitan area, the quotient per member is 22,000. There is a 15 per cent plus or minus deviation. The lowest quotient is 20,000 and the highest is 28,000. The average quotient in the rural districts in the remainder of the state is 12,000, with the lowest at 8,000 and highest at 16,000. So in Western Australia the corruption removes from the Legislative Council and is manifest in the structure of the Legislative Assembly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What have Liberals said about it at different times? Let me deal with comments made by a former Liberal Speaker in Western Australia who was so disgusted with the tasks that he was obliged to perform from time to time that he had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the most unusual occurrences&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>for him&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">was just after the 1974 election when a Liberal-Country Party Government had been elected. I was invited to join a couple of other people kneeling on the floor of the Liberal Party meeting room to make a suggestion on where the electoral boundaries should be, because there needed to be a redistribution. I did not quite understand why there needed to be a redistribution until a little later on. I was a bit naive in those days. It was needed because a couple of liberal seats were in jeopardy. That was when the electoral boundaries were changed so that the seats of Kalamunda and Darling Range stayed in the country, but seats like Rockingham were directed into the metropolitan region. At the same time the northern boundary of the metropolitan area went out a little to encompass the northern suburbs because it was felt that if those suburbs remained in a country electorate another couple of Labor Party members would come into this place. There has been some jiggery-pokery with the electoral boundaries.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have not just arrived at this position. I suffered the embarrassment of having to sit in this Parliament behind a conservative Government knowing that what it was doing was absolutely crooked . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat, absolutely crooked. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It suits the conservative forces to have the Electoral Act the way it is because they get a greater number of seats in this place and on occasion control both Houses.</PARA>
<PARA>In fact, they have always controlled the Legislative Council. Is it any surprise that, when we hear the unction of the Manager of Opposition Business, we dismiss it out of hand? He defends the last corrupt parliament in Australia, the last corrupt parliament in this country. It is not just a Labor Party epithet that this situation is utterly corrupt; it is a finding of the royal commission that this situation is utterly corrupt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Manager of Opposition Business says that we must not do anything with any set of constitutional arrangements that upsets people in Western Australia, he says it on this basis: the people in Western Australia are unfree when it comes to these democratic practices. What he says he wishes to do is to channel power to a parliamentary situation which is unrepresentative, the only unrepresentative parliamentary situation in the entirety of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this particular instance, as I explained at the outset of my speech, he has no grounds for complaint. A small party might have a few words to say on that matter because in that sort of situation the small party, as we know it, might well disappear from this chamber. But in terms of the balances between the states, nothing is disturbed. If anybody wanted to disturb them, it could not be done by prime ministerial fiat; it would have to be done by a referendum in which everybody would have a chance to vote. It would also require a majority of the states for it to be carried. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I am glad that he raised it in that way because the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) also came out and said a few words about disunion. It is terribly important to say a few words about disunion. I say at the outset that secession is treason. What disturbs me more and more about the sort of commentary that we get, given that nobody else is raising the issue&mdash;Liberal party members in Western Australia always say, `We are not for secession, we are for a better federal system'&mdash;is that it is only the Liberal Party which is raising secession. It set up the straw man; it opposes the straw man. That is the proposition that it puts forward. In so far as there is any secessionist agitation, treasonable agitation at all in Western Australia, it is a product entirely of Liberal Party officials and some Liberal Party members. It ought to be named for what it is, dealt with for what it is and we should have no truck with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If ever there was an indication that the federal arrangements continue to be supportive of Western Australian interests, if ever there was an occasion of that, it is the blue that is currently going on about Grants Commission recommendations. Those matters will have to be sorted out by the governments. But it sure as heck does not indicate that Western Australia, under this government, has had an unfair carve-up of the resources that go to the various states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, who would pay the pensions? Who would defend a country of two million people with the population massively centred on the south-east corner of the country? People's living standards and very survival as the nation in the long term would be threatened by any successful outcome to that secessionist sentiment. As I said before, it is only the Liberals, who have benefited so much over the years from the continuing corruption of the Western Australian parliament, who are the force now raising that issue of secession. Is it any wonder? What a wonderful little bailiwick they have set up for themselves off there in the corner&mdash;with their pocket boroughs, with their massive imbalance between country and rural interests, with the only corrupt electoral system in the entire country supporting the continuation of their abused executive power in that state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Manager of Opposition Business has come into the chamber, so to set his mind at rest I will conclude where I began. The Prime Minister was not talking about changing the distribution of seats between the states; he was talking about changing the mode of election for those seats. That is a matter for argument and discussion. It is not a matter for characterisation by the opposition as somehow or other working against the interests of the small states. If anything, an argument could be sustained that it would have exactly the opposite effect. But that would not be a reason necessarily for doing it either. More broad principles of discussion about what does constitute a better form of representation ought to apply. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the House wants to make it corrupt but, as a good Western Australian, he would not hang around and listen. He says that if there is anywhere in Australia where each vote is not of equal value, that is corrupt. Then, of course, he wants us to believe that he does not think that system should apply in the Senate. He lectured us on the situation in Western Australia where, in some rural and remote area electorates, frequently represented by the Labor Party, the number of voters is less and said that that was wrong, but that we could trust him when he told us that that same system, when applied to the Senate, was right. That is totally illogical. It is a pity he did not spend more of his time addressing the actual situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that his assurances carry no weight. It was not the Prime Minister who talked about a new system of voting in the Senate; it was the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Evans.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And you understand, of course, that there's 12 senators for Tasmania with 400,000-odd people, as it is for Queensland, as it is for NSW . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Surely that is a hint that he totally opposes the concept as laid down in our constitution. The constitution, when dealing with the Senate, states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until the Parliament otherwise provides there shall be six senators for each Original State.&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the point, but there are the views of the Prime Minister adequately reinforced today when, in response to the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack), he complained about this House&mdash;`carefully constructed to represent equally the interests of the people in the smaller states and the larger states'&mdash;`usurping executive authority'. That is exactly what we are worried about; that is what we are terrified about in Western Australia. We are terrified that with his imperial attitude to executive authority&mdash;and I believe he sees that authority as himself&mdash;his whole republican debate has been about conditioning people, under cover of a national identity, that it is time to change the basic representative position of the Senate and how it represents the smallest state with equal numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to grin when I hear members from the Western Australian Labor Party grizzling about the fact that there are too many votes in rural Western Australia. It is about time they asked themselves why they cannot win a few seats in rural Western Australia. They have equal chance; they can oppose me any time they like. But they cannot get the votes of the people. They do not trust them. But in Queensland a similar gerrymander stood for years, introduced by the Labor Party because in those days they could get the votes in the country; people voted for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no inequality in this arrangement when one considers the massive distances associated with this country called Australia. The founding fathers were adamant that the political system had to provide for minorities. It is amazing how we can be told about the minorities that are going to parade this weekend and their rights, but the rights of the minorities as they represent the people of a state with a very small population do not have the approval of the Prime Minister because they might, as he said today, `usurp executive authority'. He got `unrepresentative' in about three times and `the spoiling chamber' in a couple of times. Apparently it is all an attack upon good, responsible government, he told us. We have just seen a minister resign for being most irresponsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the points that worry me. But I am further worried as a Western Australian because the balance of power in favour of this centralist government&mdash;if the Labor Party has its way&mdash;is about to be increased. The Labor Party wants to send us the ex-Premier of Western Australia as a member of this House and a close supporter of the Prime Minister. It is commonly said over there that they are going to get Keating's representative in Fremantle, not Fremantle's representative in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This person's history as Premier was one of conceding everything that the state holds dear to Canberra. We have the only segment of the international rail system in Australia that makes a profit and provides good work for Western Australians. She rushed off to Queensland and without any payback said to Bob Hawke, `You can have it'. That was one blank piece of paper she signed. Then she signed another to say that we would go into a national licensing system for road transport, notwithstanding the very special circumstances of Western Australia, where railway lines cover a quarter of the state and where road transport is the only means of servicing people and, in fact, large numbers of Labor electorates. She signed a piece of blank paper that committed our state to multiplying the licensing fee of those vehicles by four, quadrupling them, and, of course, passing on that cost to people living literally thousands of miles away&mdash;further than from Melbourne to Brisbane&mdash;from the central supply system of Perth. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there is other evidence of how determined the Prime Minister is to take over the entire country, be it by changing the structure of the Senate or by all the other devices he has used.

He gives nobody else any rights. He does not recognise that the people of Western Australia have a view that is contrary to his own and that they have elected a state government to represent that view.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;(4.47 p.m.)&mdash;I am genuinely touched by the newfound concern of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and of other honourable members opposite for Western Australia. The reality is, having put forward a matter of public importance on Western Australia on Tuesday and again today, they are not concerned about Western Australia at all; what they are concerned about are their electoral necks in Fremantle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Tuesday the MPI was: `The serious implications for Western Australia of the constant and continuous erosion of Australia's federal system of government'. What did the honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan) and the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) do on that occasion?  They spent the vast proportion of their time tipping a bucket on the former Premier of Western Australia, Carmen Lawrence, who is now the Labor Party's candidate in the federal seat of Fremantle. This is consistent with their current strategic political approach which, at every turn, is to engage simply in personal abuse and mud-slinging, a political strategy which we found discovered on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> and which has not been denied by any opposition member. On the contrary&mdash;we have seen it reinforced time and time again in question time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the MPI on Tuesday, we on this side saw them off on that occasion by referring to COAG and by quoting from Richard Court's document which he released at the recent COAG meeting. Honourable members opposite will recall that the Premier of Tasmania, Mr Groom, when asked whether he had read it, said:  `Ha, very interesting; it brings back memories'. I will come back to the memories shortly.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The topic of the MPI today is `the threat posed to states such as Western Australia by the Prime Minister's plan to radically alter the Senate voting system'. What is that about? That is all about what we found in a headline which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> earlier in the week: `Court misses the States' rights drive'. The article starts off by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Channel 7's Canberra bureau chief, Dennis Grant, summed up the mood at the Hobart meeting of state leaders and the Prime Minister last Friday. He told viewers: `Frankly, Richard Court has made a bit of a goose of himself'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The view was that the wheels had fallen off Mr Court's States' rights barrow. And his own sort&mdash;fellow Liberal Premiers&mdash;had hardly helped his cause.</PARA>
<PARA>Further down in that article we find what the MPI is all about today. `What's behind all this?' asks the Western Australian commentator Malcolm Queckett. He then refers to Professor David Black from Curtin University, and I suspect they both come to the following conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And, a healthy States' rights view had also become a political tool. It was seen as a vote winner in WA.</PARA>
<PARA>This is all about the Liberal Party's electoral neck in the noose in Fremantle. If honourable members opposite think that by running this MPI today it can somehow get a few votes in Fremantle. Let us just address ourselves to the actual substance of the matter of public importance rather than the politics. The MPI states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The threat posed to States such as Western Australia by the Prime Minister's plan to radically alter the Senate voting system.</PARA>
<PARA>The intellectual point behind the MPI is that somehow the Senate protects the states. That is its basic thesis. Forget about the voting system, the basic thesis here is that somehow the Senate protects the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I move to that, let us see what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has actually said about the Senate's voting system. The honourable member for Bennelong drew a very long bow, which the Manager of Government Business (Mr Beazley) debunked in his contribution. But no-one actually referred to what the Prime Minister had said in the course of his radio interview in Queensland the other day. Let me quote from the transcript of that interview. The Prime Minister was answering a question and he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the changes of Australia in the last ten years are right out in front of or up to the best and out in front of most of the OECD area of the western world and I take a lot of pride in the fact that the Australian political system has answered the policy call that Australia needed.</PARA>
<PARA>Again we see that the emphasis on our side is on policy changes rather than personal abuse. The interviewer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, I'm glad you touched on the political system. Just a couple of questions. I won't hold you up much longer . . . I didn't vote for the Greens or the Democrats in the Federal election yet it seems these people somehow have grabbed the balance of power.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They held your Government to ransom at the last Budget, they held the Mabo legislation up for quite some period of time. Australians by and large are a little concerned that minority groups can manipulate Government and Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think that's a good and legitimate concern because if you've got twelve senators to be elected in the Senate, the way the proportional representation system works, largely that twelve is devised into a hundred and a quota ends up being around six percent or a little less than six percent to elect a senator.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And you understand, of course, that there's twelve senators for Tasmania with four hundred thousand-odd people, as it is for Queensland, as it is for New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So it's not a representative chamber, the Senate. It's not a representative electoral system and if you get down to these very low quotas, what you end up with is people who could never get a majority of public votes holding powerful positions in the Senate as a consequence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I mean, this is a major and legitimate issue in our public and national life.</PARA>
<PARA>To which the compere said, `Fair comment'. What did the Prime Minister say today in response to a question without notice on that subject matter? He referred to the simple presence of a voting system in the Senate not being a holy grail. He also made the point that the Senate is not a states house, it is a party house. That is the fundamental point here: the Prime Minister is referring to the Senate being a party house, not a states house; he is focusing on its electoral system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at how the Senate's electoral system might be changed. The Senate's electoral system can of course be changed by legislation, but that requires the Senate's cooperation. The Labor Party does not have a majority in the Senate, so the passage of such legislation would naturally entail support from more than one party&mdash;more than this party. So if the Senate voting system is to change, it will be done through legislation passed by the Senate. It is hardly the great threat which the honourable member for Bennelong would have us believe and, as the Prime Minister said in his radio interview, this is a legitimate conversation and discussion which we can have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members opposite may not actually know it, but this is the subject of some academic interest as well. If honourable members bothered to go to the Parliamentary Library they would see that in October of last year the Parliamentary Research Service actually produced a paper on Senate electoral systems. That paper referred to various Senate voting issues under these subject headings: the objects of the current system of proportional representation, arguments over the relative merits of the various forms of proportional representation, overseas experience and the use of thresholds in PR systems, and estimates for the result of Senate elections with eligibility thresholds. This is a legitimate public issue and is of some academic interest as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to making the point that the Prime Minister is making, namely that we are entitled to have a legitimate public discussion about the nature of the Senate voting system, I want to come back to the theoretical or intellectual point of the MPI, that somehow the Senate is a states house and protects the states. I make two points. Firstly, when was the last occasion that the Senate actually voted on state lines?</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Filing" NAMEID="QT4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5V5">Mr STEPHEN SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to Mabo. The answer is: we cannot find it. My colleague from Western Australia the honourable member for Moore raises Mabo. Let me simply say this to honourable members opposite: in the course of the Senate's consideration of Mabo, the government put forward amendments to its original legislation, which had the support of industry in Western Australia. What happened? To a man and woman, Liberal senators voted against those amendments. Why did they vote against those amendments? Because they knew that what was in the noose on that occasion was not the interests of those relevant industries in Western Australia but the head of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). That is a very good example of the point I am making. I am glad the honourable member for Moore raised it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us now see what the great paragon, protector and defender of the virtue of Western Australia, Richard Court, has to say about the Senate. What is the paper that I referred to in the House on Tuesday, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rebuilding the federation</EMPHASIS>, all about? We find in the course of that paper Premier Court lamenting the fact that when the federation was formed it came from colonies with light imperial control. He laments the virtues of John Forrest in 1890. I made the point, and I make it again, we on this side innocently thought until some time ago that the opposition was represented by the honourable member for Bennelong handcuffed to his 1955 white picket fence, but now we discover that honourable members opposite from Western Australia are with Richard Court, handcuffed to Lord Forrest's grave in Karrakatta. This is where they are intellectually fixed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of Premier Court's document he laments the fact that external affairs of the states are no longer controlled by London. He laments the fact that Privy Council appeals have been abolished. He laments the fact that we cannot have uranium mines in Western Australia. He supports effectively the notion of succession, and he laments very gravely the fact that the states cannot have an income tax, which is his secret hidden agenda here. Richard Court basically wants&mdash;and honourable members will find it on page 16 of his paper&mdash;the states to be equal with the Commonwealth so far as taxing powers are concerned. He wants a separate state income tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does Richard Court have to say about the Senate? If the Senate is the great protector and defender of the virtue of the states, what does he have to say about it? We hardly find anything about the Senate in his document other than the reference on page 11 to a check on central power. He said in his document:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Founders included explicit constraints on the power of the Commonwealth. One of these was the Senate. Unfortunately, the Senate, conceived as a "States House" and a House of Review, has not been an effective institution . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Richard Court is not even saying that the Senate has a role in protecting the states. Opposition members here are trying to do damage to Carmen Lawrence and to enhance their prospects in the Fremantle by-election. The Senate is not a states house, it is a party house. We will win in Fremantle. I will tell honourable members opposite one thing for sure: their mud-slinging and their bucket tipping will not damage Dr Lawrence, the former premier, because when the Fremantle doctor arrives she is going to blow them away. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That Mr Rocher be appointed Second Deputy Speaker of this House.</PARA>
<PARA>This appointment comes as a result of the report of the committee of privileges. It is important because there are two people who determine the behaviour of this House: the person who occupies the chair as Prime Minister and the person who occupies the chair as Speaker or deputy speaker. It has been said before in this House, but I think it is worth reflecting on again, that former Speaker Snedden gave his view on the qualities that a person needed to occupy the chair: judgment, commonsense, patience, tact, a sense of humour, self-confidence, presence of mind and firmness tempered with kindness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Allan Rocher, the honourable member for Curtin, is an ideal person to act as Second Deputy Speaker of this House. He entered the parliament in 1978 as a senator for Western Australia. He had 2 1/2 years as a senator, and during that time he held two positions that helped him gain an understanding of the parliament: deputy government whip, and  a member of the Senate privileges committee. In 1981 he resigned his position and stood for the seat of Curtin in a by-election when Vic Garland retired. He won that by-election and he joined a select group of people who have moved from the Senate to the House of Representatives&mdash;only 14 since Federation. Surprisingly, 12&mdash;perhaps soon to be 13&mdash;have come from this side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his time as member for Curtin, from 1983 to 1990 he occupied that chair from time to time as a deputy chairman of committees. In 1990 he was a parliamentary secretary, in 1992 senior parliamentary secretary, and later that year a shadow minister. He has also served on two other committees that helped give him a good broad understanding of the parliament, the House of Representatives, and what is required as a deputy speaker. He was on the standing orders committee for two years and he was on the procedure committee for two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of fairness, I can remember a time in early 1989 when I was sitting in this House and the honourable member for Curtin was occupying the chair. The then member for Franklin, Bruce Goodluck, was performing and he named him and had cause to have him suspended from the House. It is not often that a person occupying the chair suspends someone from their own side, Mr Speaker, and we would commend it to you. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to standing as a candidate for parliament, he was a builder. He is a fellow of the Australian Institute of Building, he was President of the Master Builders Association in Western Australia and he is a fellow of the Institute of Arbitrators Australia. He has been actively involved in arbitrating disputes between companies and that sort of quality is excellent for someone to be Deputy Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, all this comes as a result of the report of the Standing Committee on Procedure. I cannot pretend that we on this side of the House are happy with that report and how it has been implemented. The Second Deputy Speaker relates particularly to the main committee chamber and we are prepared to give that a go, but there are a few things that will not really work there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think a room on the second floor&mdash;just another ordinary committee room&mdash;is adequate for the dignity of the main committee of this House; a quorum of three is something of a farce; and the fact that strangers will not be allowed on the floor will mean that the public will not have access, which is an enormous pity. We are also not happy with the way the sin-bin operates. Mr Speaker, it is two to nothing to our side of the House and, given the behaviour of the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) and the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) over recent days, we would like to see you even that up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, with your indulgence: I congratulate my Western Australian colleague the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) on his appointment as Second Deputy Speaker. I assure him that, whatever might have been said in nominating speeches, we will also see you as Deputy Speaker in this place in the detail stage. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge) very correctly identified what will be a very difficult task, though, of getting the new committee, the new process, bedded down. I do not think we have necessarily seen the last of the changes to standing orders associated with that. We will have to see what happens and whether or not it operates satisfactorily.</PARA></TALK.START>

Both in this place and the other, I think the opposition parties have done the parliament well in their selection. We have had an opportunity to see Allan as a deputy chairman over many years. I agree with the comments that were made about his impartiality and his comprehension of standing orders. There is not a huge number of members who take delight in making themselves cognisant of standing orders. Allan is one of the rare exceptions to that. He has an encyclopedic knowledge of them, which he will use well. He also has a very considerable affection for this place. As such, I am sure that he will be able to carry that affection through to gracing what is now the very high office that he holds. </PARA>

Although <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> does not record my remarks, I remember saying quite clearly, `Would the attendants kindly remove that person from the chamber?'. I made a terrible mistake. I should have said, `Remove him and detain him'. He was able to get away and dine out on the fact that he was suspected of being the chicken but it was never proven. It was not able to be proven because he took sanctuary with the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) who, I am pretty reliably informed, was a chief urger in that little exercise.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report I have just tabled covers the operations of the Committee of Members' Interests for the calendar year. Honourable members will be aware that it is this committee which was established to oversee the operations of the Register of Members' Interests under which all members of the House are required to register a range of interests for themselves, their spouses and any dependent children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three matters contained in the report which the committee has directed I should especially bring to the attention of the House. They are, firstly, whether there is a need for the registration of the membership of all organisations, irrespective of the nature of those organisations; secondly, the need to update the value of gifts requiring registration to reflect current values since those values have remained unchanged since the introduction of the registration requirement in 1984; and, thirdly, whether there is a need for the registration of interest held during the period between the dissolution of the House in one parliament and the provision of full statements of interest in the next parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall deal with each of these matters. The first is the registration of membership of organisations. When first adopted on 9 October 1984, the resolutions provided for registration as follows:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(m)any other interests, such as membership of organisations, where a conflict of interest with a Member's public duties could foreseeably arise or be seen to arise.</PARA>
<PARA>Following consideration of this requirement, the then Committee of Members' Interests on 18 September 1985 dealt with the difficulties of attempting to lay down a definition of conflict of interest, and went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst the resolutions limit the requirement to the registration of membership of organisations `where a conflict of interest with a Member's public duties could foreseeably arise or be seen to arise' it has become apparent to the Committee that membership of any organisation, be it political, sporting, recreational, religious or community based, may have the potential for a conflict of interest situation to arise. For this reason, the Committee is reluctantly forced to the conclusion that it will be necessary for it to require the registration of the membership of all organisations. It seeks the concurrence of the House in this approach to the registration requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The House accepted the committee's recommendation and, on 13 February 1986, amended the resolutions to require the registration of:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(m)membership of any organisation, and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(n)any other interests where a conflict of interest with a Member's public duties could foreseeably arise or be seen to arise.</PARA>
<PARA>The new requirements caused some concern. On 12 September 1986 the then Leader of the House wrote to the committee suggesting that the amended requirement went beyond what was necessary and suggested a return to the original wording. At that time the committee was not prepared to support the proposed change and stood by its earlier decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991 the matter was again considered by the committee. In its report for that year it recommended a return to the original wording. In doing so, it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of the notifications of membership of organisations clearly have no potential for a conflict of interest situation to arise, eg. membership of a small sporting club. It is possible that quite inadvertently some Members may have overlooked the requirement to notify membership of such an organisation or to have not notified becoming a member within the required 28 days. The Committee recognises that Members are very busy people and can very easily overlook these minor requirements. It is the majority view of the Committee that in many instances the requirement places an unnecessary burden upon Members and serves little or no purpose.</PARA>
<PARA>The present committee strongly supports that view and again recommends a return to the original wording of the resolution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter is the need to update the value of gifts requiring registration. On numerous occasions this committee's predecessors have recommended that the value of gifts requiring registration should be updated to current values. No action has been taken on these recommendations. When first fixed in October 1984, the values were $100 for gifts received from other than official sources and $250 for gifts received from official sources. These sums remain unchanged, despite the fact that in current values the sums should be $166 and $415 respectively. In its report the committee again recommends the regular updating of these values and proposes that the sums should be changed immediately to $200 and $500 respectively. It urges the House to make these adjustments without further delay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third and last component is whether there is a need for the registration of interests held during the period from the dissolution of the House of Representatives in one parliament and the provision of full statements in the next parliament. Once again, this is a matter upon which previous committees have made recommendations on several occasions. Under the existing resolutions the requirement to register interests ceases at the dissolution of the House in one parliament and does not resume until 28 days after the opening of the new parliament. In the normal course of events, this has the effect of causing a substantial gap in the registration requirements for continuing members. In the case of the 1993 elections, this gap was almost four months. It also means that any notification of interests which a member lodges during that intervening period does not form part of the register, causing confusion for members and persons searching the register. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This committee strongly recommends that urgent consideration be given to this matter. It also recommends that, if the resolutions are amended to close this gap in respect of re-elected members, newly elected members should be required to register interests held on the day of their election and to notify any alteration of those interests which occur from that date to the date of the lodgment of their full statements&mdash;that is within 28 days of making their oaths or affirmations at the opening of parliament. On behalf of the Committee of Members' Interests, I seek an early response to these outstanding recommendations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the time the Native Title Bill was debated last year, the opposition and the Liberal Party opposed very strongly this legislation which we saw as a disaster. We saw that it was going to strike at certainty and that it was going to explode 200 years of settled land law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday I was reading the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, as most honourable members of this place do, and I read that native title claims over the Great Barrier Reef are hampering tourist operators and placing pressure on the reef management agency which is now demanding more public funds to cope. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is asking for $500,000 in the coming federal budget to handle matters associated with the Native Title Bill. Aborigines have lodged native title claims over very substantial portions of this important national asset. As we endeavour to encourage the tourist industry to expand, all honourable members must be concerned over the fact that it is impossible at the present time to expedite consideration of many applications being made by people to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, I understand, about 200 applications every year lodged to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. These relate to reef based developments, mostly for moorings and pontoons. We might think, of course, that these are relatively minor developments in many cases, but they are important developments to enable tourist operators to properly bring this important national asset to the view of many people who visit our country and who wish to view and inspect it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also interesting to note that a company in North Queensland actually had to hire Aboriginal workers in exchange for permission from a Cairns Aboriginal community to build a pontoon. Quite frankly, this smacks of blackmail and is another indication of how the Native Title Act is not operating the way the government said it would. The Chairman of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, Professor Graham Kelleher, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . 10 per cent of staff time was being devoted to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander concerns.</PARA>
<PARA>He pointed out that the need to negotiate with native groups over research, zoning plans and day-to-day management of the reef had escalated tremendously since 1992, when the High Court's Mabo ruling highlighted traditional rights of Aboriginals. That was the time when the unelected and unaccountable politicians on the High Court hijacked the law as we had understood it over the last 200 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, as a result of the law of this land and as a result of the High Court decision, is required to allocate 10 per cent of its budget to deal with Aboriginal concerns. That is a major problem. The result is that the Treasurer (Mr Willis), when formulating the budget for this year, will receive a request from that authority for $500,000 of taxpayers' funds, which the authority claims it needs to enable it to carry out its obligations imposed by this parliament and by the courts of the land. This is yet another indication of the failure of the Native Title Act to meet the needs of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will call upon the opposition, when we return to government at the next election, to repeal the Native Title Act so that we are able to bring forward legislation which accurately represents the aspirations of the Australian people.

It is a discriminatory act which strikes at certainty in the land law, at jobs, at development and at opportunities for all Australians, including Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 750 affected workers have every right to feel bitter and frustrated about a political somersault which can only cast doubt on the Government's commitment to other policy promises. An alarming aspect is Mr Court's refusal to admit that a pledge has been broken and his indignance that people have had the temerity to interpret the decision in such a way.</PARA>
<PARA>That was certainly the way that it was interpreted by the local President of the Midland and District Chamber of Commerce. I quote from the Midland <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Echo</EMPHASIS> of 2 May 1993:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision to close the workshops ends 90 years of tradition at Midland, and has outraged the Opposition and the local business community.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Midland seems to be battling all the time, and we have this continual drain on manufacturing operations." he said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is a person who one would normally expect to be sympathetic to the policies of the Liberal Party, yet he said that in the local paper. I quote as well from a letter he wrote to the Minister for Transport, Mr Charlton, on 28 April imploring the minister to review his decision:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is little doubt that the government decision as it stands will adversely affect the region as a whole with a commensurate effect on Coalition credibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the opinion of the Midland Chamber of Commerce and Industry the closure decision requires rational review . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, that review did not occur. I attended a public meeting in Midland at which the President of the Midland chamber of commerce said that he hoped the government would have second thoughts before `we close down the whole lot'. I quote from my handwritten note of that meeting. He said, `It would be absolutely criminal to close down a manufacturing site of this size'. That is precisely what the Liberal Party in Western Australia has done&mdash;an absolutely criminal act to betray the people of the Midland workshops and the people of the Midland region generally. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In Tuesday evening's adjournment debate I paid tribute to pioneering Australian aviator Mrs Lores Bonney, who died last week. Mrs Bonney set a series of Australian and international aviation records during the 1930s. Her achievements have received public recognition in a number of ways. For example, her name has been engraved on America's Famous Flyers Wall, which honours the greats of aviation, a Bonney display is mounted at Sydney's Powerhouse Museum, an annual Bonney trophy is awarded amongst British flyers, her achievements have been recognised by the Smithsonian Institution and the International Air and Space Museum in Washington DC, and, until recently, the VIP room at Brisbane's international terminal was named in her honour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Bonney was awarded an MBE by King George V after her 1933 solo flight from Australia to England&mdash;the first woman to have achieved this feat. However, it was not until 1991 that she received the Order of Australia for her services to Australian aviation. Although she was feted in foreign countries she visited, she was given scant recognition in Australia at the time of her record-setting, extraordinary feats of skill, endurance and courage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once her flying exploits were interrupted by the advent of World War II, she slipped from public sight and memory almost totally. It was not until the ABC television documentary <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Somehow we almost forgot Mrs Bonney</EMPHASIS>, which was shown on the Queensland ABC network in 1977, and the publication of her biography by aviation enthusiast Terry Gwynn-Jones in 1979&mdash;which I was honoured to launch&mdash;that she received appropriate recognition in her home town of Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The VIP room at Brisbane's international terminal subsequently became the Lores Bonney Room&mdash;a fitting tribute given that all her record-breaking flights commenced at Eagle Farm. I was therefore disturbed to be told by a fellow mourner at her funeral that the Lores Bonney Room no longer existed and that the mural dedicated to her, which it contained, had been dismantled and the whereabouts of it as well as a display of her flying memorabilia were uncertain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday I contacted the Brisbane office of the Federal Airports Corporation to make inquiries about this matter because I was concerned about the possibility that, once again, this outstanding Australian would slip into obscurity. The FAC general manager was absent from Brisbane, but I was pleased to be informed by the officer acting in his place, Mr Cam Spencer, that this was not so. Mr Spencer's explanation of events is that, as part of the internal expansion of the present temporary Brisbane international terminal, the VIP room has been done away with. Mrs Bonney's memorabilia are now in a display case above the staircase to the Ansett international lounge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Spencer informed me that the plans for the new Brisbane international terminal, which is presently under construction, include a Lores Bonney Room, the equivalent of the previous VIP room. He also told me that it is planned to have a Lores Bonney display in a public area of the terminal so that this tribute to her aviation achievements will be seen by the general public. Naturally, I welcome this proposal because such a display can only serve to extend public knowledge of this truly remarkable Australian. </PARA>

Given the power of television as a public communications and information medium, I hope that the ABC will quickly act on this suggestion and give the documentary national exposure at a popular viewing time. The last and only time it was broadcast it was shown only in Queensland, and late at night at that. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only would this be a very fitting tribute to a great Australian, who was an extraordinary contributor to this nation during her long life, it would also make known for the first time her contribution to the generations who today owe so much to the pioneering work done by our early aviators&mdash;who were always at risk of their lives&mdash;to make possible the development of Australia which followed the development of air travel and air transport. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take this opportunity to elaborate on some proposals which I mentioned in the recent appropriations debate that could stimulate the creation of around 200,000 jobs over the next three to five years, thus adding significantly to the job creation that is now accompanying the projected improvements in economic growth. I want particularly to expand on the comments that I made in relation to government purchasing policy. Evidence submitted to the parliamentary inquiry into government purchasing policy now under way touched on the following difficulties that have been encountered in government purchasing: poorly trained purchasing officers under the devolved system have little understanding of the whole of life purchasing concept; there is a cultural bias among purchasers against Australian manufactures; the tendering systems are costly and complex and that, of course, is making access difficult for small and medium enterprises; and slow payment by the Commonwealth is also exacerbating the problems of these firms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think much can be done to redirect government purchasing to Australian manufactures and stimulate employment, especially in the manufacturing sector. One way of diverting some $2 billion worth of consumption expenditure from imports to local manufactures could be to step up the public education campaign to encourage Australian citizens and businesses to purchase Australian. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I see the honourable member for Burke is in the chamber. He has been a long-time supporter of the buy Australia campaign and I commend him for that interest and involvement. The object of this exercise ought to be a diversion of some $2 billion from expenditure on imports to local manufactures. In the process we can create some 60,000 jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This attack via the public education campaign against the cultural bias that exists among Australian households and some businesses against Australian manufactures would certainly do much to engender confidence in the sector, create demand for Australian goods and services, and create jobs. There is a significant cultural bias in the community against Australian products. If we effectively resource a public education campaign over a long period of time we can alter the structure of domestic private consumption and redirect some of that expenditure to Australian manufactures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final proposal involves the availability of capital and the enlargement of the venture capital base in Australia. The key problem out there in the business sector is that we have a very innovative and very inventive business sector&mdash;we register more patents than any other country in the OECD of comparable economic size&mdash;but, while there are a lot of inventions, the venture capital market and indeed the banking system do not cater for these smaller enterprises and they have difficulty getting access to the capital required to bring their ideas to the commercialisation phase. The government does have a vehicle to partly address this venture capital need&mdash;the Australian Technology Group. It is currently cashed up to the tune of $30 million. I suggest that that capital base be expanded to between $100 million and $150 million from both government and private capital sources. Its efforts ought to be directed to getting at least 100 new technologies and products into the marketplace; that is a long-term measure that would assist the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposals that I have put can be adequately financed from increased revenues as the economy grows and for a reorientating of expenditures from within existing programs. They are essentially demand driven and attack both the twin task of creating employment and reducing the deficit. As I have said, they are demand driven, they are aimed at import replacement, they are inherently employment generating and they can be used to stimulate economic activity in regional areas. There are some 200,000 jobs there for the begging for a minor outlay by the government and a reorientation of some of its programs. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the Prime Minister was unable to fit that brief meeting into his busy schedule and, since I was only advised of that yesterday, I thought I would seize the opportunity to publicly pay tribute to the year 9 students of Orara High School, who collected 570 signatures seeking the establishment of a whale sanctuary, and in particular to one young lady, Kristy Reynolds, from Coffs Harbour High School, who personally collected 612 signatures. It is important and wonderful that the youngsters of Australia have become so environmentally conscious. It is their world that they are going to inherit.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 12 June 1988 the Heatherhill branch of the Australian Labor Party in the electorate of Dunkley moved the following motion:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the ALP Dunkley FEA, strongly urges the Commonwealth Government to Review the drug called co-trimoxozole, the drug is marketed under the names Bactrim and Septrin.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reason being that in Britain, the Committee on Safety of Medicines has reported 64 deaths from side effects of the drug in 1970-84. Most of these were blood disorders in elderly people.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Dunkley FEA, recommends the Minister for Health place a ban on the drug . . . until the ADEC's recommendation is confirmed or reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Dunkley FEA deplores two giant pharmaceutical companies fighting to keep a lucrative antibiotic on the national health scheme, despite recent evidence of toxic side effects.</PARA>
<PARA>I remind honourable members that the motion is dated 12 June 1988. The motion was moved by Jean Stemmer, who is one of the stalwarts of the party, and seconded by Colin Hampton, who is the ALP candidate for Frankston East in the next state election. He will naturally win that seat. This was the reply from the honourable member for Jagajaga (Mr Staples), the then Minister for Housing and Aged Care, in August 1988:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Community Services and Health has been aware of adverse reactions to these products and the matter was recently considered by the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ADEC considered that there are specific uses for which these products are appropriate. ADEC's area of concern related mainly to the use of these products in the elderly. It therefore recommended that the product information for all formulations of trimethoprim with sulphamethoxazole should be amended to include a warning of the increased risk of serious adverse effects in elderly patients and that the use of these products should be discouraged in this age group.</PARA>
<PARA>These products are still being used in this age group and people are still being affected. On the 28th of last month, nearly six years later, there was a radio interview on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The World Today</EMPHASIS>. The transcript of that interview reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RICHARD PALFREYMAN:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Concerns have been raised in Britain, today, about the safety of two anti-bacterial drugs that are also commonly used in Australia. The British committee on the safety of medicine says that hundreds of people may have died in that country over the past 20 years, after taking Bactrim and Septrim. The drugs contain two rival anti-bacterial products, one of them sulphur based. The safety of Bactrim and Septrim has been reviewed in Australia, and they now carry a warning that they can be dangerous for the elderly.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Ross Bradbury, a specialist in infectious diseases at Sydney's Concord Hospital and a member of the federal Adverse Drug Reaction Advisory Committee, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They have been widely used around the country because of their great value, particularly for treating urinary tract infection and, to a lesser extent, for treating respiratory infection. But more recently, those of us who advise in this area for treatment . . . have tried to advise people to avoid the Bactrim and Septrim because of their sulphur content. Increasingly, particularly for urinary tract infections, organisms have become resistant to sulfur, and we no longer need to use the mixture which is sulfamethoxazol and trimethoprim, but rather just advise using trimethoprim alone.</PARA>
<PARA>These drugs are still being used six years after the Dunkley FEA raised its concern with the minister, and they are still killing people. It is a disgrace. Many people are experiencing horrendous side effects from these drugs. Who knows how many people have died in Australia. If these drugs can kill the elderly, who knows what long-term effects they will have on those of us who use them while we are still young? I call on the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) to direct the Adverse Drug Reaction Advisory Committee to hold an extensive review of these drugs and determine whether the deaths warrant the continued use of this product. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The accommodation of ageing Australians is being neglected by this government. The situation is now one of deep crisis in my state of South Australia. Many elderly people are currently unable to obtain positions in nursing homes and hostels, placing pressure on acute hospital beds and the families of elderly people waiting at home for a bed to become available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services, however, is quite convinced that accommodation for the aged is adequate. It has calculated the number of nursing home and hostel beds for each state and region based on a formula. According to the magic equation, there is no additional need for beds above the levels determined. This is despite the fact that there are currently no beds listed with the Bed Vacancy Register in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we examine the number of clients registered for accommodation year by year, it becomes clear that greater numbers of elderly people are requiring nursing home care. The average number of clients registered increased by 33 per cent in 1991-92 and 44 per cent in 1992-93. The situation has worsened. In the last three months, current registrations doubled. The demand for beds has outstripped supply to a point where there are very few vacancies available at any nursing home throughout South Australia. Four months ago, an expected bed wait was days to weeks. It is now a matter of months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The paucity of nursing homes and hostel beds is effectively turning many hospitals in South Australia into sitter services. Hospitals are forced for ethical reasons to accommodate the elderly. People who need a nursing home or hostel bed are never able to return home and look after themselves. This is an inappropriate use of resources. Hospitals exist to help sick people, not to bear the brunt of inadequate aged care and social services. The health system is being forced to accommodate inappropriate cases and so is often unable to take the elective surgery cases, causing waiting lists to continue to grow unnecessarily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department clearly needs to adapt its policy. The writing has been on the wall for some time. But the department's equation has staunchly remained as the determinant for the number of beds required. According to the equation, South Australia is short of hostel beds but is oversupplied with nursing home beds. But for the elderly people, their families and the social workers who are endeavouring to find them a bed, the equation's results do not ring true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria, the hostel-nursing home balance is reversed. There are apparently too many hostel beds and not enough nursing home beds. Some war veterans who are accommodated in private hospitals would have no chance of obtaining a nursing home bed. A few years ago, the department changed the level of funding between the states to level out the discrepancies. All it actually achieved was to reduce funding to its lowest common denominator. Too many good nursing homes are now poorly funded and are unable to offer crucial paramedical services, such as physiotherapy and craft activities, which contribute so significantly to residents' wellbeing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation will only worsen with time. It is astounding that it has deteriorated so far without the department acting upon it. It had time to see that a crisis in aged care was inevitable. In its refusal to provide more nursing home and hostel beds, it has caused difficulty to many elderly citizens and their families and unnecessary cost to the Department of Veterans' Affairs and has encroached upon the funding and the function of state health commissions. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Childcare Assistance</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Childcare Assistance (formerly called fee relief) is a Commonwealth Government subsidy to help Australian families, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families, meet the cost of child care fees. Eligibility for Childcare Assistance is based on family income. The maximum level of Childcare Assistance is $92.50 a week for one child in care (rising to $94 on 1 April 1994). While Childcare Assistance benefits families, it is not paid directly to them; instead it is paid to approved child care services to enable them to reduce the fees they charge eligible families for child care.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The "chief engineer" is an industry position which is not recognised in the CAA's legislative regime, nor is it necessary to have such a position to meet any current CAA legislative requirements. The CAA's regulatory requirements were met by the airline through its having an appropriately Licensed Aircraft Maintenance Engineer (LAME) certify for aircraft maintenance. The LAME does not necessarily have to be the airline's "chief engineer", however, Western Airlines' chief engineer was a LAME.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) There is no problem with qualified maintenance staff being employed on a part time basis, as long as there is an appropriately licensed Aircraft Maintenance Engineer available to certify the maintenance carried out on aircraft being employed at the time when the maintenance is being performed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) Western Airlines had in place a computerised system of keeping airworthiness records in accordance with the Civil Aviation Regulations. The Wagga District Office only encountered one instance where it was unable to access the airline's maintenance records, due to the unavailability of airline staff. (The Maintenance Controller was not available and the Deputy could not access the system).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were concerns by the Wagga District Office that some flights had occurred which were not recorded by Western Airlines.

Western Airlines took appropriate corrective actions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(e) The Wagga District Office had tried to assist Western Airlines to set up a life development program (DA288 program). However the airline was unable to meet the administrative requirements of such a system, which was subsequently terminated by the District Office at the request of the airline. After the program ceased, the District Office was not aware of any breaches by the airline in respect of time life limitation on its aircraft components.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(f) In respect of flight operations matters, the areas of concern related mainly to the recording of flight times. As far as the CAA were aware, the check and training requirements were being met.</PARA>

This was brought to the notice of Western Airlines maintenance staff, who rectified the leak under the normal maintenance requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(h) Civil Aviation Regulation 42ZV and Schedule 9 of the Regulations details the requirements for maintenance controllers. Western Airline's Maintenance Controller had been accepted by the CAA as meeting the legislative requirements, and there was no evidence from any of the CAA's surveillance checks to indicate that he was not controlling the maintenance in accordance with the regulatory requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i) One of Western Airlines' aircraft's VHF antenna (cable type) broke, and the cable became entangled in the empennage (the forward-facing front edge of the engine air intake). This was subsequently fixed under the normal maintenance control of the airline. This could have caused a risk to the safety of the aircraft, but did not in this instance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Following an industry complaint, the CAA conducted two internal investigations, one by the South East Regional Flying Operations Manager, and another independent one by the North East Region's Administration Manager. The North East Region Administration Manager concluded from his review that the relationship between the Regional Flying Operations Manager and the District Flying Operations Manager at Wagga had reached the stage where it was affecting the efficient operation of the Region. Agreement was subsequently reached with the Wagga District Flying Operations Manager that he transfer to the Directorate of Aviation Safety Regulation's central office in Canberra.</PARA>

Based on company advice it is estimated that there are a total of about 385 workers specifically employed on uranium related activities at the two Australian uranium production centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) I have assumed that the honourable member's reference to the "Australian stockpile of uranium oxide" refers to the Commonwealth uranium stockpile that contained 2 million kilograms (around 4.5 million pounds) of uranium oxide. The market price for uranium oxide fluctuates considerably but, if sold on the spot market at the current spot price of about US$9.60 per pound, which would put the value of the stockpile at some A$60 million on the basis of the exchange rate of US71.56 cents = A$1.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The sale of the Commonwealth uranium stockpile is expected to be completed by June 1995. In the 1993-94 Budget, the Government stated that it expected that a significant proportion of the stockpile material would be sold in the current financial year. These targets are expected to be met but details about the parties with which the Government is dealing are confidential. In prosecuting this sale, the Government will have regard to the interests of existing Australian producers/exporters of uranium oxide; will seek to minimise any possible market disturbances; and will, of course, conform with all existing nuclear safeguards and other requirements governing the export of uranium oxide by Australia.</PARA>
