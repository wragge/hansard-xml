<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the report of the Australian delegation to the 91st Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference held in Paris and of the bilateral visit to Turkey, March to April 1994.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 91st Inter-Parliamentary Conference occurred at a time when the IPU wished to focus particular attention on the issues of peacekeeping and the United Nations in a post Cold War era, and on the preservation of the environment. Accordingly, these items were scheduled as the principal agenda items at the conference under the headings `Prevention of conflicts, maintenance and consolidation of peace: role and means of the United Nations and regional organisations' and `Waste management for a healthy environment'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian delegation submitted a draft resolution on the first of these and expanded upon its themes during debate and discussion at the conference. The Australian approach focused on two issues: peace building and preventive diplomacy and the peaceful resolution of disputes. In relation to peace building, the delegation stressed the need to accompany any strategy for peace with a strategy for development. International cooperation to strengthen socioeconomic development must underpin efforts to build peace and security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On preventive diplomacy, the delegation recognised that effective dispute resolution and conflict prevention is preferable to delaying action until armed conflict has begun. It called on governments to provide political and practical assistance to the UN Secretary-General in his efforts for peaceful settlement of disputes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of consideration of this topic, the Australian delegation provided to each delegation in attendance at the Paris conference a copy of the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cooperating for peace</EMPHASIS> by Australia's foreign minister, Senator the Hon. Gareth Evans. The book was well received by other delegations with some subsequently requesting further copies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The resolution ultimately adopted by the conference reflected the themes pursued by the Australian delegation. It stressed the importance of restructuring the United Nations organisation to enable it to meet the new challenges of the post Cold War era and outlined a range of approaches to assist in achieving this goal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many other meetings were attended by the delegation during the conference. They included the meeting of women parliamentarians, and meetings of the Asia-Pacific and 12+ groups, the executive committee, the Inter-Parliamentary Council and the Committee on Human Rights of Parliamentarians. Details of the deliberations of these groups can be found in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the completion of the IPU conference, the delegation travelled to Turkey to undertake a bilateral visit there. The visit was characterised by great warmth and hospitality, which served to further strengthen the links between our countries. We would certainly like to thank our hosts for that visit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of local elections at the time, it was not possible for a visit to be made to Ankara, Turkey's capital and home of the Turkish Grand National Assembly. However, fruitful discussions on a range of issues were held in Istanbul with President Cindoruk and other assembly members. The delegation appreciated the willingness of our hosts to enter into frank discussion on topical issues at the time&mdash;the outcome of the local government elections, the Kurdish question, Cyprus, and the lifting of parliamentary immunity for certain members of the Grand National Assembly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank the members of the delegation&mdash;Senator Calvert, the deputy leader; Senators Coates and Reid; and the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay)&mdash;for their cooperation and support. I also thank the delegation secretary, Anne Hazelton, for her dedication, total professionalism and ever-cheerful assistance to us all, and also Ms Geraldine Skinner, my personal adviser. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also record the appreciation of assistance provided by Ambassadors Alan Brown and Geoffrey Price, the embassy staff of Paris and Turkey, the Parliamentary Library, and Canberra based staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for the invaluable briefings they provided to the delegation. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I have great pleasure in supporting your remarks on the 91st IPU conference held in Paris. Once again, the Australian delegation was very active in the activities of the IPU. In recent years, we have taken a role which, I think, has added some considerable shine to Australia's reputation. We have also been able to ensure that we have had a disproportionate number of resolutions, particularly relating to trade issues, debated by the IPU where we have been able to put our position and have it supported across the conference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia was involved in a number of issues at the Paris conference. One that I would like to speak about in particular was the declaration adopted on free and fair elections. For some time in recent years the IPU has seen reflected in its membership the remarkable change that has swept across the world, with the resurgence of democracy in Europe, in parts of Africa and in Asia. The delegations that have attended the IPU have turned from those from the Eastern bloc that, in many instances, used to be mono-political to those that represent very vibrant democracies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The IPU has started to take a view that it will only accept as new members parliaments that are committed to democratic values. Part of the reinforcement of that was the declaration on the criteria for free and fair elections which was adopted on 26 March at the IPU conference in Paris. I had the honour to be the rapporteur for the committee that dealt with this declaration. I am very pleased to say that there was very little change to the text made at the committee stage. The text that was adopted by the IPU conference would reflect the way in which elections occur in democracies such as ours. The IPU executive has made that text the yardstick by which it would like to see new entrants considered. From our point of view, as a parliament that has participated in the IPU for many years, that mechanism which we have adopted is very useful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members who attended those conferences in the 1960s, the 1970s and the early 1980s would have seen delegations that were representative of only one point of view; it was very difficult to get democratic proposals through the conference. The swing that has now occurred has made the IPU a lot more relevant to modern politics than it was in the 1970s and the early 1980s. The IPU has 129 countries represented in it. Parliamentarians from 112 countries attended the conference in Paris that adopted this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I resume my seat I would like to say a couple of words on the role that Australian delegations have played in recent years at the IPU. The member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) has taken a leading role in the women parliamentarians meeting, and she has also done a lot of work with the Asia-Pacific parliamentary group. It is of interest to recall that the Asia-Pacific parliamentary group was sponsored by the Australian delegation when Roger Shipton and Tom Uren were our two delegates. The member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) has been a member of the Cyprus committee, which has played a role in the IPU. Senator Calvert was elected at the last conference to be the vice-chairman of one of the IPU's standing committees. At the last conference, I completed four years on the IPU executive, finishing my term as the deputy president. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a relatively small country, Australia has played a significant role over the years. All the members who will attend future IPU conferences can look at the work that their colleagues have done and feel that Australia is certainly held in high regard in that forum of international parliamentarians. With 129 countries being affiliated and usually 110 to 120 parliaments being represented at each conference, it is the oldest and the largest forum of politicians in the world. I am very pleased that the Australian parliament has been playing a role in it. The declaration on free and fair elections that we adopted at the last conference is a landmark decision for the IPU to have taken. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The aim of the Telecommunications (Standards of Service) Amendment Bill is to provide statutory provisions to prevent consumers in rural areas from falling even further behind the majority of Australian consumers with regard to the quality and quantity of new technology associated with the telecommunications services to which they have access. The substandard level of services in rural areas is highlighted by a number of basic facts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of these is that fault clearance within one working day is deteriorating rapidly. Secondly, almost all rural consumers have a fault sufficient in severity to degrade their service, and many such faults are outside even the limits set by providers. The third and most telling point is that 74 per cent of rural and remote exchanges still remain to be upgraded to the point at which consumers are able to access detailed billing, carrier preselection, call plan charging options, and IDD and STD ring-backs. In comparison, only one per cent of metropolitan exchanges are yet to be so upgraded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My motivation in presenting this bill is also driven by my frustration at the absence of a decent mobile telephone network in my own electorate. This is an area nearly one-quarter of the state of Victoria and of which less than 15 per cent is served by mobile telephone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will amend the principal act, the Telecommunications Act 1991, to make the standard telephone definition more relevant to current consumer needs and more responsive to future technological developments. The standard telephone service is to be renamed the `standard telecommunications service', to which all Australians should be entitled to access in order to conduct their businesses in a modern world's best practice manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will provide for the definition to be amended on the basis of recommendations made by Austel under section 40 of the principal act. This is a significant alteration as previously the standard telephone service definition was defined as only a basic handset facility unless otherwise prescribed by the minister by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides that Austel's current responsibilities, defined in section 40 in relation to carrier performance and competitive safeguards, is to be expanded to include consideration of the appropriateness and equity of the standard telecommunications service definition. Special regard is to be given to the service availability to the majority of Australians, the implications of making such services available nationally and the technical demands of consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as reporting on the adequacy of the definition, Austel will also be empowered to recommend to the minister changes in that definition. It is likely then that the standard telecommunications service which consumers are entitled to access will continue to change in response to the advent of new technology. It may be mobile telephones today but video conferencing and other technologies in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the minister accepts wholly or in part the recommendations of Austel, the change to the standard telecommunications service definition would be effected through regulation and then would be a disallowable instrument through either house of the parliament. Austel's assessment of the standard telecommunications service would be published as part of the authority's annual report on carrier performance. The bill complies with standing orders 292 and 293 and consequently requires no appropriation and imposes no tax or levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the objectives of the Telecommunications Act 1991, which this bill amends, is to ensure that the standard telephone service is supplied as efficiently and economically as practicable, on an equitable basis, to all people in Australia. The problem with this objective lies with the definition of a `standard' telephone service, which the 1991 act simply defines as nothing more than a telephone handset. The weakness of this definition is that it undermines the abovementioned objectives of the act by not incorporating provisions for new technologies. It is inflexible and outdated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main purpose of this bill is to make the Telecommunications Act a much more powerful and compelling instrument. The bill also includes a number of specific practical considerations to provide protection against the likelihood of overzealous requirements being enforced on carriers. This is to ensure that carriers are not required to make all services available everywhere the minute they become available to 50.1 per cent of the population. This bill overcomes such a situation and also provides the basis on which the public can be provided with a lot more information on the services which can be made available to all Australians. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)urges all Australian governments and relevant semi-government bodies to ensure that Mrs Bonney's contribution to the nation receive appropriate, continuing public recognition.</PARA>
<PARA>The motion has two purposes. The first is to acknowledge the outstanding achievements of the Australian pioneer aviator Mrs Lores Bonney. The second is to attempt to ensure that Mrs Bonney's great achievements are never again allowed to slip into the obscurity with which Australia once mistreated her outstanding achievements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Born Maude Rose Rubens in South Africa on 20 November 1897, her family came to Australia in 1906 and settled in Melbourne. In 1917 she married Harry Bonney and moved to Brisbane, where she became a housewife and society figure. In 1928 Mrs Bonney met the man who was to change her life: her husband's cousin, Bert Hinkler. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hinkler took her for a joy-ride in an aeroplane and her great passion for flying was born. In those days women were not educated and they certainly did not fly aeroplanes. She secretly learnt how to fly. In due course she had to let her husband know what she was doing. However, when the day came that she had to tell him, to her surprise and joy, he not only encouraged her to get her pilot's licence but bought her her own aeroplane after she qualified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Her most outstanding achievements can be summarised briefly by three records. The first record she set was in August and September 1932 when she became the first woman to circumnavigate Australia by air. In 1933 she became the first women to fly from Australia to England. In 1937 she became the first person to fly from Australia to South Africa. Although these achievements can be stated very briefly, they represent fantastic episodes of courage and endurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I spoke on the adjournment debate on 1 March this year, following Lores Bonney's funeral on the Gold Coast, I had incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the flight logs of those three journeys.

The matter of fact comments in the `Remarks' section of those logbook entries reveal next to nothing of the extraordinary drama and near tragedy of this journey. Suffice to say that many pilots lost their lives at this stage of pioneering aviation; a substantial number of those who died simply disappeared, usually over the sea, never to be seen again.

Terry Gwynn-Jones surmises that one of the reasons Mrs Bonney was never taken seriously&mdash;even when she was setting these extraordinary records and showing enormous courage and physical and aviation skills&mdash;was that she was a society woman. Unfortunately, the treatment of her achievements is all too typical of the previous treatment of many outstanding Australian women&mdash;save perhaps for some singers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Her achievements received public recognition in a number of ways, albeit principally outside Australia. For example, her name has been engraved in America's famous Fliers Hall which honours the greats of aviation; a Bonney display is now mounted at Sydney's Powerhouse Museum; an annual Bonney trophy is awarded amongst British fliers; her achievements have been recognised by the Smithsonian Institution in the International Air and Space Museum in Washington DC; and in the 1980s the VIP room at Brisbane's international air terminal was named in her honour following the publication of Terry Gwynn-Jones's book and the subsequent publicity that the book and Mrs Bonney received in Queensland. </PARA>

I was further informed that the plans for the new Brisbane international terminal, presently under construction and nearing completion, include a Lores Bonney Room&mdash;the equivalent of the previous VIP room&mdash;and a Lores Bonney display in a public area of the terminal so that this tribute to her aviation achievements may be seen by the general public. </PARA>

Most of us had to be offloaded in Sydney and, in certain cases, undertake perilous journeys by car to arrive here today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first time I was aware of Mrs Lores Bonney's achievements was in viewing the ABC documentary by Adrienne Swanton, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Somehow We Almost Forgot Mrs Bonney</EMPHASIS>, which my colleague the member for Moncrieff referred to. I had much pleasure in reading the wonderful book by Terry Gwynn-Jones, which I will refer to and provide extracts from in my contribution today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is all too common for the achievements of women in our history to be thoroughly neglected. I remind the parliament that Australia needs its heroes, but it also needs its heroines. In looking at this remarkable woman, we need to pause and wonder how a woman who was part of a very strict social structure found the courage to undertake the sorts of feats referred to by my colleague. The interesting thing was that it showed up very strongly in her adolescence. After Lores Bonney's family moved to Australia from England, she was sent to school. As chapter 1 of Terry Gwynn-Jones's book states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As she developed, two traits became obvious to her parents and teachers: her love of music and hate of discipline. She was a rebel. This rebellious side of her nature led to her being moved to several schools in an attempt  to instil her with more discipline.</PARA>
<PARA>And further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At both schools her end of term reports consistently spoke of her artistic and musical ability, her dislike for scientific and mathematical subjects, and always of her independent nature.</PARA>
<PARA>I think this is a wonderful example of the importance of fostering the rebellious and the independent in all our young people. I continue quoting from the book:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the daughter of a wealthy family in the Victorian era it was never considered that school should prepare Lores for any sort of career . . . However, in 1911 Lores' Australian music professor suggested that his talented pupil should receive further training in Europe. Her parents decided that a finishing school in Europe might well be the solution. A couple of years of gently administered lady-like spit and polish would curb her rebellious nature and extend her musical ability.</PARA>
<PARA>This opportunity to travel overseas, to find herself alone, and to have to use her courage and determination to learn languages and to achieve by herself was excellent training for her future. As the member for Moncrieff indicated, her meeting with her husband's cousin, Bert Hinkler, and her first joy-flight, were the beginning of her love of aviation. They travelled from Eagle Farm airport to Yeerongpilly to deliver a bunch of roses to a good friend. One would be amazed even today that someone would take such a flight from Eagle Farm to Yeerongpilly. What did she experience as she made this first flight? I refer back to Terry Gwynn-Jones's account:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hinkler steadily opened the throttle, and keeping straight with a touch of the rudder, began the takeoff run across the tiny airport. Lores felt the seat boring into her back as the aircraft accelerated rapidly. The tail rose and a second later they were airborne. For Lores, the sensation was magnificent.</PARA>
<PARA>He quotes her directly:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was the answer to my dreams. I had always adored birds for as long as I could remember. And there I was literally feeling like a bird.</PARA>
<PARA>Anyone who saw the film <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Out of Africa</EMPHASIS>, remembering the flight that Isak Dinesen takes, could perhaps share that sensation. The story continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She never flew with her cousin again. He returned to England and was tragically killed attempting a record flight to Australia in 1933.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But he had sown the seed of what was to become a lifelong passion. Life for Lores Bonney would never be quite the same again. She had flown.</PARA>
<PARA>As the member for Moncrieff indicated, Lores undertook an incredible apprenticeship. Not being able to even drive a car, she learnt how to fly, she learnt the art and science of mechanical maintenance and then discovered that her husband was indeed incredibly supportive of her commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to one of those exciting events on that trip to England from Australia to give some flavour to the real courage that she showed and that would be very difficult for most of us, in these days of comfortable aviation, to imagine. This event follows the emergency landing and the time she had to spend in places such as Malaysia and India. It refers to her trip from Constantinople to Sofia. I quote from page 103 of the book:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nightmare returned the next day, two hours after leaving Constantinople. Bound for Sofia, a little over an hour away she was flying high at 3500 metres to clear the mountains below, when threatening storms suddenly intensified and closed in around her. She turned quickly to head back to Plovdiv but it was too late. Another huge storm cloud had come up and now sat on the mountains barring her escape. She was trapped between layers of cloud, with storms forming a wall on all sides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For five hours she circled around and around in the cloud-enclosed `room'. There was nowhere to go. She would have no chance if she attempted to penetrate the black walls of rain, hail and turbulence-filled cumulonimbus. Far below were the deadly cloud-covered mountains and here and there she could see the peaks pushing up through the dull grey carpet of cloud. The white ceiling above was no escape either. It extended way above the limit that her aircraft could attain, and once in it, the airframe would pick up ice and the carburettor throat would slowly contract then close as the ice built up. When that happened the Gipsy engine would falter then stop for good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even as she flew, more patches of cloud closed in around her and at times she was forced to fly `blind'. The hours under the blind flying hood at Archerfield were again paying off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Things became even worse when her vital turn and balance indicator stopped working. She had great difficulty keeping the wings level in cloud. Turning became a chilling experience, and on one occasion she temporarily lost control and came diving out of cloud heading straight for the side of a mountain. She turned away just in time, but realised that the moment of reckoning had come. She would have to find a way down somehow. Her `clear room' had finally disappeared. She was totally surrounded by cloud. She decided to follow the mountainside down.</PARA>
<PARA>The account goes on to quote her:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`The ground at any price was my motto now. Feeling my way down carefully, almost at stalling point, several times I passed through clear patches and there would be a temporary easing of the strain. Then again, I would come into a dark patch, and turn away in fear that it might be the timbered side of the mountain showing through the cloud. It was a nightmare business, straining my eyes to penetrate the piled masses of opaque cloud, uncertain which might hide the danger of the mountain pressed in on either side. At last I came through a patch of filmy stuff, and with indescribable relief saw a railway line below.'</PARA>
<PARA>This was only one of many incredible experiences that Mrs Harry Bonney experienced on that flight. When Terry Gwynn-Jones and Denys Dalton retraced her steps in 1976 they were truly amazed by what she had achieved, given that they had a much more modern and efficient aircraft with sophisticated radio navigation aids. Terry Gwynn-Jones concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That flight, plus my own recollection of training in Tiger Moths, direct descendants of her aircraft, made me better understand the magnitude of Mrs Bonney's achievements and her courage.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe it is important that the new international airport at Brisbane be named the Lores Bonney airport so that we will not forget this hero of our aviation history. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)That the following amendment to standing order 26 (Committee of Privileges) be adopted for the remainder of this session: Omit "to inquire into and report upon complaints of breach of privilege which may be referred to it" and substitute "to inquire into and report upon matters of contempt or breach of privilege which may be referred to it".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)That the following matter be referred to the Committee of Privileges: The question of the level of protection or privilege which should apply to communications between Members of Parliament and Ministers, including communications by letter, facsimile or other electronic or automated means.</PARA>
<PARA>The first part of the motion seeks to amend standing order No. 26. At the moment, at least in theory if not in practice, the Privileges Committee can only investigate complaints. I think it is important that the Privileges Committee be allowed, from time to time, to traverse and examine the broader issues surrounding privilege and, indeed, look at the effectiveness of some of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of the first part of the motion is to give the Committee of Privileges that power. The second part refers to the Privileges Committee the question of the level of protection or privilege which should apply to communications between members of parliament and ministers, including communications by letter, facsimile or other electronic or automated means. My interest in this arose when my good friend the honourable member for Bowman, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca), had a fax published in a paper. This matter was referred to the Privileges Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to draw to the attention of the House that, given the history of the way this place developed and bearing in mind that the founding fathers did not envisage members or senators having staff or electorate offices&mdash;it took many of them months and months just to come to this place, where they would stay for six months&mdash;it is true to say that what was said and done in here was of the utmost importance. Mr Deputy Speaker, if you were to survey all the members of this House, or if you were to ask their constituents what is important about a member of parliament, they would say that it is the way they service the electorate, not the way they speak here, not the way they do their committee work or operate in the party room. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably the most fundamental thing a member can do is to handle problems on behalf of his constituents. What have we seen over time? The powers of members to represent their electors have diminished. They have been diminished by the Privacy Act. They have been diminished by the executive of the government, the ministers. I understand that and I do not expect them to fix it. The most privileged and precious role that members have is representing their constituents honestly, diligently and vigorously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not apologise to this House for wanting to do that in an unencumbered way. In wanting to represent those constituents, I might write to a minister in very fulsome language; I might even question his competence and the competence of his department. I would make no apology about that. That is what I believe I am elected for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was in my electorate office on Sunday going through some correspondence, I got a letter&mdash;and here is a fax of it. It is about someone who lives in housing department flats. What is she complaining of? She is concerned, she is suicidal; I think I would be too. She has been raped twice in these flats and robbed on seven occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do ministers, members of the public, the press, the Privacy Commissioner, or whoever, expect me to sit down in a very unemotional way and say, `This matter can be dealt with in the fullness of time. I do not want any urgency. I want you to overlook the fact that complaints have been made or that this woman has desperately tried to get a transfer. You shouldn't mention that at all'? Of course I will not, although in a cooler moment I might think that perhaps I could have rephrased things or said them better. But this woman expects me to do something about it, and quickly. If I have to offend a minister in a letter, if I have to offend a public servant in a letter, I will&mdash;and I am not apologising for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, under the current system of privileges, if I write a letter to the minister, if I fax it or E-mail it to him through the computer system&mdash;I would send a copy to my constituent because he or she would be entitled to know what I have done about it&mdash;and that somehow gets published or broadcast, I can be hauled before the courts because my actions are not covered by privilege. I think that they should be covered by privilege. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying that this is an open and shut case. All I am asking is that the Privileges Committee look at the situation and bring the Privileges Act up to date. For goodness sake, we are facing the year 2000! We do not want to go back to the quill and ink stage, or to turbocharged pigeons. We are living in a modern era. Notwithstanding our low standing, people's expectations of their members of parliament are higher, are greater, and so they should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without fear of recrimination, without fear of a writ, without fear of unnecessary entanglement with the courts, we should be able to represent our constituents no matter how poor or how low, whether they are migrants or whether they are rich or poor. I do not resile from that, and that is what this motion is all about. It was brought about, as I mentioned, by the circumstances surrounding the honourable member for Bowman, and I felt for him in those circumstances. I do not think we handled it very well. I said then and I say now: every member of this House could be faced with the same situation. If you are not, maybe you are not doing your job; I do not know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If some letters that I have written to ministers were published, rebroadcast or one of my constituents decided to spread them around, they would get me into all sorts of trouble before the courts. But that is my job, that is why people come to me. They are dissatisfied, they cannot get anywhere and they see me as their last resort, their last avenue of hope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a contrary point of view which I respect; that is, we have to be careful that we are not disempowering citizens and that civil servants do not become second-class citizens. I say in response to that that I have a fundamental belief in the role of a member of parliament and believe members should not be challenged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Trying to stop me coming to this parliament to attend a session of parliament is a breach of privilege and if that occurred I would get all the support I needed from members of parliament, but if I vigorously pursue the interests of a constituent of mine and use some very forceful language that may be defamatory&mdash;it may be the truth, but it may be defamatory&mdash;I get no protection. That is clearly wrong. It is about time the Committee of Privileges&mdash;I have a lot of confidence in it&mdash;has a look at this situation and brings us up to date. If we want to enhance the position of members of parliament and the esteem in which they are held, it is important that we be given this opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention another case, concerning civilian employees of the RAAF who have not been given access to superannuation. I have suggested politely to the minister that I think there is a cover-up operating. It was a very polite letter but I am getting nowhere. My next letter may very well be defamatory because I want some action on behalf of my constituent. I hope all members of parliament will think about, if not support, this motion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have pleasure in joining in the debate on the motion moved in passionate terms by the member for Chifley (Mr Price) this afternoon in an attempt to update and clarify the privileges of the parliament in relation to communications between members of parliament and ministers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important for those of the general public who listen to such debates and who may be in the gallery today to understand that the privilege we talk about is not the privilege which is used popularly to indicate that an advantage flows to some particular member of a class or certain group within society&mdash;for example, when we talk in popular terms about a privileged class. Privilege in the parliamentary form is the special rights and immunities which belong primarily to the parliament itself but through that to its members also. Those rights and immunities are considered essential for the operation of the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Privilege has a long history. It goes back to centuries past and the struggle in the United Kingdom between the parliament, as representatives of the people, and the monarch over sovereign parliamentary rights. Therefore, the privilege of parliament being referred to is that body of rights and immunities which enable the parliament, and the members thereof, to carry out its responsibilities and functions in a proper and rightful manner. These rights and immunities allow the parliament to meet and carry out its proper constitutional role in a democratic society. It allows members to discharge their responsibilities to their constituents and to be properly involved in the parliamentary process without fear of obstruction or prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the House of Commons has indicated&mdash;the forms and procedures of this parliament are largely based on the parliament of the United Kingdom&mdash;the privileges are not the prerogative of members in their personal capacities. The House of Commons has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In so far as the House claims and Members enjoy those rights and immunities which are grouped under the general description of "privileges", they are claimed and enjoyed by the House in its corporate capacity and by its Members on behalf of the citizens whom they represent.</PARA>
<PARA>It flows from that that breaches of privilege and contempt of the parliament are punishable by the parliament itself. Whilst there are technical differences between privileges and contempts, generally they are matters which can be dealt with by the parliament itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that as long ago as 1704 the House of Lords and the House of Commons agreed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That neither House of Parliament hath any power, by any vote, or declaration, to create to themselves any new privilege, that is not warranted by the known laws and customs of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>So it is important that for almost three centuries a condition has been established that, whilst there are certain privileges which are important to allow the parliament and members of parliament to carry out their responsibilities, the parliament does not have carte blanche to simply go out and create new privileges at any time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at the privileges which have been enumerated and created, one sees that probably the most important of those privileges, those rights and responsibilities, is the right of free speech in parliament without liability to action or impeachment for anything which is spoken in this place. So members may come into this chamber or the Senate and make statements which, outside those chambers, would be defamatory and would enable a citizen to take that member or senator to a court of law in a civil action for defamation. Those statements are privileged; that is, an action against the member or senator will not lie because members and senators are said to be subject to what is called absolute privilege. This flows from the ninth article of the Bill of Rights, which was enacted in 1688, which declared:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>So there is a long history over a number of centuries in which the parliament has said that, in order for the democratic process to be carried forward in a way in which the parliament can retain the sovereignty of the people, what is said in this chamber and in the Senate ought to be subject to that privilege; that is, a member or senator should not be subject to a writ for defamation in the ordinary civil courts for whatever is raised in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliament has looked at this in Australia. In fact, the Parliamentary Privileges Act of 1987 sought to clarify in some more detail what those privileges are. Section 16(2) of the act sets out what the proceedings in parliament are for the purposes of article 9 of the Bill of Rights of 1688. The section states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . "proceedings in Parliament" means all words spoken and acts done in the course of, or for purposes of or incidental to, the transacting of the business of a House or of a committee, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, includes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It sets out four subsections of which, for present purposes, subsection (c) is important. Subsection (c) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the preparation of a document for purposes of or incidental to the transacting of any such business;</PARA>
<PARA>So the proceedings of parliament are subject to or covered by the privilege, and that has been clarified in the act of 1987 to include the preparation of a document for purposes of or incidental to the transacting of any such business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question which was raised by the honourable member for Chifley then comes to this issue of whether a communication in written form between a member of parliament and a minister of the Crown is one which is covered by privilege, his assertion being that it ought to be looked at by the privileges committee to determine whether or not there ought to be an extension or a clarification of the privilege so that a member of parliament can write to a minister and that communication and the terms of the communication would not be subject to an action for defamation in the courts of law. That was made fairly clear by the member for Chifley in some of his examples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems clear&mdash;and this has been looked at a number of times over the years&mdash;that the scope of absolute privilege does not extend to normal communications between members and ministers. There may well be a qualified privilege, however, which applies to the communication between members of parliament and ministers. That is, if there is an obligational duty on the part of the member of parliament to communicate this information to a minister, that may well be covered by what is termed a `qualified privilege'. If not attenuated by malice, then that qualified privilege would be a sufficient defence if an action for defamation were brought.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the member for Chifley is suggesting that qualified privilege is not perhaps certain enough and that there ought to be an absolute privilege in relation to these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue was looked at by the Joint Select Committee on Parliamentary Privilege, which reported to the parliament in October 1984. In that report the committee decided not to extend the privilege in the way that has been suggested today. The committee quoted the words of Mr Justice Evatt in the case of Gibbons and Duffell, which it said `provide an eloquent and powerful caution against specific extensions of the defence of absolute immunity in defamation proceedings'. The paragraph by Mr Justice Evatt which was quoted says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Absolute immunity from the consequences of defamation . . . is so serious a derogation from the citizen's right to the State's protection of his good name that its existence at all can only be conceded in those few cases where overwhelmingly strong reasons of public policy of another kind cut across this elementary right to civic protection; and any extension of the area of immunity must be viewed with the most jealous suspicion, and resisted, unless its necessity is demonstrated.</PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He went on to say that `the extension of the privilege by reason of analogies to recognised cases is not justified'.</PARA>
<PARA>It is clear, given what Mr Justice Evatt said in that case, that in the view of the joint committee at that stage it was not justified. However, as the honourable member points out, there has been the case involving the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca) and an earlier case involving the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) in which this matter arose. Whilst I do not come to any firm conclusion about whether we ought to extend the privilege in this way, I believe that the member is right and proper in raising the matter in this place and in indicating to the members of this House that there is a real issue that ought to be determined. I certainly support him in his motion to have the matter referred generally to the Privileges Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to second this motion and speak in support of it. The presentation by the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) shows his depth of feeling. I congratulate him on his presentation, which highlighted his concerns when it comes to privilege for members of parliament. This motion is one of the most important we will be debating in this place. It goes right to the heart of our duty as members of parliament to represent our constituents. When we represent the constituents in our electorates probably the most important thing we do is to represent individuals' rights. We can speak in this place as often as we like, and we probably do not get a lot of recognition for doing that, but the individuals in our electorates, the individual Australians out there, hope and expect that members of parliament will be able to make sincere representations to ministers from time to time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are often called to act on behalf of those constituents in very sensitive matters, and the honourable member for Chifley mentioned a letter he received from one of his constituents. Often this involves communication with ministers' offices. On a lot of occasions we have to explain and put our views forward regarding the problems of people who have come to us, often as a last resort. Perhaps they should come to us first in some cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So any move to strengthen the level of protection regarding inter-office communication, whether it be by letter, fax or any other means, must be applauded by members of parliament. For this reason I am pleased to support the motion in toto and in particular the second part of the motion, which refers those matters to the Committee of Privileges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we act on behalf of the constituents in our electorates as members of parliament, we are subject to moral and ethical imperatives not to expose any information that is used of an extremely private and confidential nature. I am sure that we all respect that position. The right to do this without fear of persecution or incrimination by the media, the public generally or any other quarter is absolutely sacrosanct. I hope that it is a right which the majority of the media would respect. I think they do in most cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the media is under an obligation to respect the right to privacy of an individual who comes to us looking for assistance&mdash;and that is often the case. The communication between the office of a member of parliament and that of a minister should be given the utmost protection, and its confidentiality should be acknowledged and respected by third parties that may have some vested interest in exposing that communication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would not want to give the impression that our friends in the media do not act professionally and ethically in this regard. I am sure that the overwhelming majority of them do, and I respect them for that. What should really be mentioned in this debate is a more common example of someone gaining some sort of benefit by having access to confidential material. I am speaking, of course, about the occasion when an employer might persecute an employee because that person has appealed to the federal member for assistance in an industrial relations matter, such as a case of unfair dismissal or a dispute over pay rates. That does unfortunately happen from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had that experience in my own electorate. Several of my constituents have said to me that they approached me for assistance only as a last resort after they had exhausted all other avenues&mdash;various government departments and what have you&mdash;because they were afraid that their boss might find out and, if not actually sack them, at least make life very difficult for them. I think that is very sad. I think this happens a lot particularly in government departments. I know that personnel at the air force base in my electorate would very reluctantly come to speak to their federal member because they believe that the processes within the defence department should be sufficient for them. Quite often they are not. It is important that we make sure that those people have the right to come to us without fear of persecution in any way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to be able to make a brief contribution to the very passionate proposal made by the member for Chifley (Mr Price). As a member of the Privileges Committee and as a former member of the committee on privileges in the Victorian parliament for eight years, many of the matters raised by the member for Chifley have struck a chord of interest and sympathy. A member of parliament faces great challenges and pressures in society. Generally speaking, there are signs in society that people are now more prone to issue a writ against members of parliament than before, although it has recently been the subject of interesting comment in the High Court, and we will see how that develops as time goes on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to be too definitive as to my attitude in this matter except to say that, in the interests of Australia, the community and democracy, I support the need for a further thorough inquiry into this issue. I do that not to sit on the fence, but I think as a member of the committee I should reserve my substantive view until such time as the matter is fully considered. I do support the idea of further work being done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The words expressed by Mr Justice Evatt in the case of Gibbons v. Duffell are words of warning. Any committee that examines this and any member of parliament interested in it will obviously have to bear in mind that, if absolute immunity is to be extended to written communications from a member to, say, a minister that have the effect of damaging the reputation of a citizen, that is a matter not to be taken lightly. The rights of citizens and individuals are paramount and have to be absolutely respected. We should bear in mind that if a letter is written to a minister which does have absolute privilege the citizen may not know that the letter has been written about the citizen's behaviour or character, yet the minister will have read it, and it may well be that the minister's deliberation would lead the minister or the department to take certain steps to the detriment of the interests of that citizen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pose the question: is it fair that a citizen should have an action taken against him to his detriment without his knowing that the action was based on an allegation which he knew nothing about and which he had no chance to rebut? That is a factor that has to be considered: if absolute privilege is to be extended, will we then have to ensure that the citizen is notified immediately of the communication from the member and given the opportunity to rebut? If that happens, a lot of areas for immediate consideration are opened up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To balance that, we do have freedom of information&mdash;the citizen's right to know about and access documents. Yet freedom of information is a procedure that is somewhat frightening to an ordinary citizen, to a lay person. I do not think we should rest content as members of parliament and simply say that a citizen's rights are protected if a member writes to a minister and says something detrimental about his or her character because after all, even though the citizen is not given notice of the letter having been sent to the minister or of the minister's consideration, the citizen has general rights of access to a file under freedom of information. I think it is too glib to say that, because citizens do not always take action under freedom of information. Sometimes they do not know. Why would they know? They need to seek it because they are not aware that the letter has been written. We can see there are great problems associated with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point we have to bear in mind in a contemporary parliament, and particularly following the recent High Court decision, is that the community is increasingly questioning the role of members of parliament and, unfortunately, adopting a cynical attitude to the actions of members, most of whom are hardworking and trying to do their job in the interests of their constituencies. Nevertheless, the community is very wary of members of parliament seeking further protection apparently to make their job a little easier. Perhaps it is the community's view that it is not fair and that members of parliament should be brought more to account. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to commence by referring to the point made by the honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) regarding the recent High Court decision on defamation and how it affects politicians. It would now appear that for better or for worse there is almost an unfettered right for ordinary citizens to say what they like about a member of parliament. In the context of this debate today, that puts into new light the right of parliamentarians to say what they like about a particular matter to a member of the executive when they are forthrightly representing their constituents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the job of a member of parliament to forthrightly and vigorously represent his or her constituents. In the process of doing that, members of parliament should&mdash;and must if they are to do the job properly&mdash;express themselves in a strong and forthright manner. The problem we have with the lack of clarification about the privileges of a parliamentarian making statements outside this chamber is that if parliamentarians choose to make a strong statement which could be potentially held to be defamatory then they could be impeded from doing their job properly because they could be sued in the courts of the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an enormous contradiction between that position and the position brought down recently by the High Court, which says that the citizens we represent have the right to make those strong statements about us and that we have no redress through the law of defamation. I would suggest that for that reason alone there needs to be a substantial relook at this issue of absolute privilege, or qualified privilege, for members of parliament in terms of their communications with a member of the executive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> If the position that has been interpreted via the Privileges Committee is to be upheld, we can no longer forthrightly represent a position to a minister of the Crown which is potentially defamatory of a member of the public or, more importantly I suppose, a member of the Public Service. In my view, we ought to be able to freely do that because the size and scope of modern government makes this imperative. There are many departments of state&mdash;social security, employment and education, the Child Support Agency&mdash;and many areas of government which vitally affect the lives of citizens where very important decisions affecting people's lives are effectively delegated to senior public servants. Yet we would be unable to claim privilege if through our communications with the minister we were to make a very strong and damning statement about the actions of an unelected official. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my short time in this House, I have already dealt with many constituents. I have written very strong words in communication with ministers of state. In fact, on one occasion I had a minister's staff member say to me that I should not have written the letter the way I did because it was so strong that it could not possibly be sent on to the department. Of course, I replied, `I did not expect it to be sent to the department in the first place.' But that illustrates the point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A problem does not exist, given the size of modern bureaucracy, unless it is in writing. We cannot communicate on the phone all our problems with the actions of unelected officials, because if we were to check in two weeks we would find there to be no record. So we can do our job only through the written word. That is why it is essential that this question of privilege be cleared up. If our communications with ministers of the Crown are not granted absolute privilege, we should at least be accorded some form of qualified privilege. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scope of modern government is now so wide that we cannot effectively represent our constituents across the range of all those very important issues, unless we commit our strongest thoughts and strongest representations to paper. Therefore, I commend the motion moved by the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), particularly in light of the recent High Court decision that all of us in this House have a responsibility to clarify the position of privilege so that we can more effectively represent the needs of our constituents and do our job properly. </PARA>

The intent of the motion is to bring the Parliamentary Privileges Act and the practice of parliamentary privilege up to speed with new technology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, any statement made in parliament or during a parliamentary committee hearing enjoys absolute privilege. This fact has been covered by each of the previous speakers. The Privileges Committee can recommend that contempt of parliament proceedings can be invoked for matters other than privilege. The case of the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca) illustrates the problem of members writing letters to ministers on behalf of constituents. The honourable member for Bowman wrote to a minister on behalf of a constituent and sent his constituent a reply. The letter made remarks about a departmental officer. In the officer's opinion the remarks were derogatory and he issued a writ of defamation against the honourable member for Bowman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this motion is to extend parliamentary privilege to modern forms of communication such as fax and mail and, for that matter, electronic mail which we, as members of parliament, all use. We on this side of the House do not have much to argue about with that. We believe privilege should be extended. I hope the reference is made to the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I want to make one criticism. I believe that the diminishing role and the diminishing importance of parliament have emphasised the shortcomings of the Privileges Act in addressing new technology. The fact is that parliament is being used less and less for the purpose it was created for. Ministers no longer make policy statements in parliament. Rather, they issue policy statements at the Press Club, at a press conference or in a committee room. The parliament is not being used for the purpose it should be. How many times do we open the morning papers and find that a new policy has been announced? This place is the place in which to do that. This is also the place where private members should have the opportunity to stand up and make statements on behalf of their constituents. The fact is that we do not have the time because the government does not allow sufficient time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All members of parliament have constituents who write to them, asking that their cases be represented in parliament. But we cannot do it; the opportunity does not arise. We all have constituents who write to us and say, `I want you to ask this question in parliament,' but we do not have the opportunity. Those of us who sit in this place know that the questions asked at question time are structured. They are asked on our side by the front bench and on the government side by arrangement with the minister&mdash;the dorothy dix questions. Question time is for entertainment rather than for seeking information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If parliament accepts this reference to the Privileges Committee, I suggest that the terms of reference be made much broader. We examined the role of the parliament. Are private members given sufficient opportunity to raise matters of importance? I will be asking that the privilege be extended because there is insufficient opportunity in the parliament to do that. I suggest that adequate time be set aside in the second chamber which now operates in this parliament for private members' business and for members to raise queries on behalf of constituents and to put their cases on the parliamentary record. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I read the motion moved by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), I was particularly interested in what he was saying. I must say that people on this side of the House would agree with much that is included in the motion. Our problem is, however, that Labor members are once again resorting to the suggestion that, whenever we find a deficiency in some aspect of life or activity in Australia, it really is a requirement of the federal government and not the state or local government to remedy it. This particular motion says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House declares its support for:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)federal funding of municipal libraries to promote quality, equity and access to those services in areas of greatest need; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)developing Australia's network of 1400 municipal libraries as public access points on the so-called information superhighway.</PARA>
<PARA>It is pretty clear and, I think, very common ground that municipal libraries, like other libraries in Australia, perform a very worthwhile and essential role, particularly given the decentralised nature of library facilities and the fact that municipal councils throughout Australia provide these facilities in regional areas. For many people, particularly those a long way from the capital cities, the local library is often the first and last port of call when information is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that in recent times there have been 100 million loans from Australian libraries and 10 million requests for information. That indicates that libraries are performing a worthwhile role and that they are an essential element in keeping the people of Australia informed. As technology becomes more widely available and more advanced, it is essential that library facilities in various parts of the country be enhanced and improved and continue to develop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I differ, however, from the honourable member for Werriwa because he says that these improved facilities should be brought about by the involvement of the federal government. In his speech he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the clever country has not been clever enough in its support of public libraries.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Werriwa might be correct in so far as it could be said that enough money is not being spent in the support of public libraries. I differ from him here, because he would then go a step or two further and say that any deficiency should be remedied by the Commonwealth parliament, not by the state parliament or the local authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose his approach to the federal system is very similar to the approach that we have seen from the Labor Party over the last 11 years. Our side of politics accepts that in 1901 the people of Australia federated under a constitution which gave certain powers to the Commonwealth and retained the remnant powers in the hands of the states. Of course, the states have delegated some of those powers to local authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that it is important to recognise that there are decentralised views within Australia. It is also important to realise that different regions and different states of Australia might have differing priorities in relation to various matters. I believe that a proper and vigorous federal system is an essential element in our democracy. I do not think the approach suggested by the honourable member for Werriwa is the right approach, because he suggests that a national set of standards should be imposed from the central or federal level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Werriwa also pointed out that the states have disparate guidelines in relation to libraries. The nature of federation indicates that, of course, that is natural and normal. If he is not happy in his own state with what the state government and its predecessors have achieved in the area of libraries, he should be vocal in criticising the priorities of New South Wales. My own view though is that it is very much the wrong approach to suggest that, just because some states might not do what the honourable member for Werriwa wants them to do, that is a reason for the federal government coming in, overriding the states yet again and dictating some form of national uniformity across the 809 local authorities in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I think may have been pointed out by an opposition speaker earlier, the honourable member for Werriwa is somewhat out of step with the general approach of his own government over the last couple of years. The honourable member for Brand (Ms Fatin), who was formerly a minister, differed quite substantially from the approach of the honourable member for Werriwa, because she accepted that libraries ought to be a state or local responsibility. I will quote from a speech she made at a gathering at the National Library only a couple of years ago when she was the Minister for Arts and Territories. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I appreciate that the funding issue is high on your agenda. Nevertheless Government policy since 1980 has been that responsibility for the direct funding of State and local libraries rests primarily with State and local governments.</PARA>
<PARA>She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To change the status quo would require a rather massive shift in priorities and funding and the arguments would have to be most compelling.</PARA>
<PARA>She concluded by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not convinced that there has been sufficient shift in argument nor has it changed from when the Commonwealth enunciated the current policy.</PARA>
<PARA>So it is pretty clear that the honourable member for Werriwa is a voice in the wilderness on his side of politics. The government accepts&mdash;at least in relation to libraries, though not on all matters&mdash;that some issues should be handled at the local level. The honourable member for Werriwa is seeking to, in effect, overturn what has been a longstanding government policy in relation to libraries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the second part of his motion, the honourable member also suggests that there should be support for developing Australia's network of 1,400 municipal libraries as public access points on the so-called information superhighway. This is absolutely vital. I give 100 per cent support to what he is suggesting in this area with one objection, which is that I believe it is up to state and local governments to put the facilities into this area when working out their own priorities. I call on the state parliaments and local authorities as much as possible to allocate resources to help this information superhighway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important in any fair and equitable society that there should be access to information for people regardless of the level of their income or their means. But the honourable member for Werriwa was a little precious in parading his credentials as a proponent of social equity when he is a back bench member of a government which, during its years in office, has presided over the greatest gap between the rich and poor of any country in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will recall that on 2 June I asked the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) whether he was aware that a UN report on human development revealed that Australia recorded the highest levels of income disparity of any OECD country. Of course the Prime Minister fudged the question and failed to answer. When the parliament broke up in uproar, I was suspended for 24 hours. I brought to the attention of the government and the people of Australia what a sham this government is as far as portraying itself as the champion of the underprivileged while it has presided over the greatest gap between the rich and poor of any country in the OECD. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government stands condemned by the people of Australia. The pious words of the honourable member for Werriwa do not in any way detract from this government's shocking record. I am not suggesting that the honourable member is in any way hypocritical&mdash;I accept that he genuinely believes the substance of this motion&mdash;but his approach is quite wrong. He should be lobbying state governments and local authorities for resources to be put into this very important area of public libraries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the principle of public libraries receiving the assistance they need so that they are able to perform this vital role which everyone in the country accepts they should be performing. But I disagree with the honourable member when he says that this omission in funding and these deficiencies should be met by the federal government. In a federal system of government, it is a state or local responsibility. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Ballarat should just sit quietly. I know that he has had a stressful journey to Canberra. A road trip in the wind might have unsettled him a little. But when he interprets statements that are made by ministers and members, such as the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), as indicating that they disagree with the approach adopted by the honourable member for Werriwa, he needs to look a little closer. In a previous speech on this debate, the honourable member for Ballarat quoted a former minister, the honourable member for Brand (Ms Fatin), who said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Councils play a crucial role in delivering services to our community and they are best placed to determine local needs and priorities.</PARA>
<PARA>What has the honourable member for Werriwa said in this place, either in the proposal he has put forward or in support of that proposal, that goes against those words of the former minister? The opposition has to understand that, if we are to have national approaches to things such as libraries and access to information, it will require under the constitution the cooperative effort of not only the federal government and the state governments but also local governments, which in this case are most important. In his speech, the honourable member for Ballarat also quoted the honourable member for Lalor, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the expansion and extension of all library and information services should be achieved . . . with each service retaining its autonomy within the overall state plan for the development of these services.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, there is no contradiction with the proposal before us today. For the honourable member for Ballarat to come in here, as have his colleagues the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) and the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), to try to make this a debate about some form of centralist government as opposed to the system that we have today is a nonsense.

Another 12 per cent represents resources that the library services have to find from other avenues.

My colleagues who have spoken before in this debate have put forward statistics that indicate that certain sections of the community are better represented with respect to the percentage of people that use the service. The use of libraries by unemployed people is higher than that in the wider community. The number of books taken out by young and old people is higher in general than it is in any other of the age brackets that use libraries. They are indications of the good use that is made by members of the community who do not have as much access to the information that they require. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was claimed that in some way the honourable member for Werriwa is a lone voice on this side of the place. I again refer members to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Long Term Strategies, which is chaired by the member for Lalor. I ask members to look at the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Role of Libraries/Information networks</EMPHASIS>. This committee, which is clearly an all-party committee, made certain recommendations based on the work of the Horton committee back in 1976. Recommendation (a) states:</PARA>

Why do members opposite try to read something different into this motion?

That presents me with a difficulty, but if a government needs criticism on something like this so be it. I would encourage those opposite to revisit some of the things raised in that report in the light of what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced in Creative Nation which addressed the issues of information and what the federal government could do to ensure that that information is successful. Creative Nation stated:</PARA>

<PARA>At least part 2 of the motion moved by the honourable member for Werriwa has been agreed to by both sides of the chamber in this debate. This is a very important aspect of municipal libraries. If we develop Australia's network of 1,400 municipal libraries as public access points on the so-called information superhighway, that will be a most important effort towards ensuring that we do not see a disparity between the information rich and the information poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion was moved on 17 October, which was the start of Australian Library Week. As part of the promotion of that week the Australian Library and Information Association produced a postcard which said, `Don't get flattened on the information superhighway. Get your facts straight, ask your librarian.' This motion is about encouraging the government to come to grips with technology which, as the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) said in his contribution when this motion was last debated, is changing at an excessively rapid rate, which makes it harder for even those who work directly with the types of technologies available to come with grips with. It certainly makes it harder for those in the community that are seeking information and can now have that information more readily available and at their fingertips&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Information is set to be one of the leading commodities of the next century and the provision of information services, whether using methods which are centuries old or methods which are at the leading edge of technology, is becoming increasingly important to people. Today's debate tackles significant areas, but I am firmly of the view that there is room for some healthy scepticism. Reading the first part of this motion, one begins to wonder whether the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) is already jotting down some funding ideas on a great big whiteboard. The second part seems to represent a wide-eyed leap into cyberspace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Libraries have always been vital sources of knowledge, whether things are written on papyrus or transmitted via fibre optic cable. They are also vital parts of our communities, used by almost 40 per cent of the population. One of the reasons municipal libraries are so popular is their responsiveness to local needs. This should come as no surprise. Councils are the closest level of government to people and are the best placed body to determine local needs and priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It makes me a little suspicious then of the merits of a proposal like this that would lead to more tied grants and more Commonwealth direction over what local governments should or should not do. We have a federal system and it makes sense for Canberra to regulate many things, but this is not one of them. Under this Labor government, federal programs that promote quality, equity and access in areas of need have all too often consisted largely of photo opportunities for its marginal members and candidates. If we really believe in our libraries, then I think they deserve better than this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important not to look at information technology in an equally superficial manner. Last year, in a speech at the Banquet Hall in Whitehall, Rupert Murdoch observed that technology has liberated people from the media barons of the past. A few weeks ago he told a meeting in Melbourne that Orwell was wrong&mdash;that technology, rather than enslaving us, will set us free. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Orwell wrote in a world dominated by the intensive technology of the age of mass production. In an age where new technology and business tools&mdash;personal computers, desktop publishing, fax machines and cellular phones&mdash;are tools that give individuals flexibility, we have new ways to work and to express ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Murdoch told his Melbourne audience that the next century will be one in which the tyranny of distance will be abolished. For Australia, it will be a century of networking, where we will profit from our strategic location. As a highly educated, English speaking society, technological change has integrated us into a global economy as much as any place on earth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Murdoch, of course, is absolutely right. The power and potential of the information superhighway is truly revolutionary. But its emergence is already creating new dilemmas for government. It will be an enormous task to decide how best to deal with the rapid convergence of various TV delivery systems; local, long-distance and mobile phone services; films; computers; and compact discs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the same day that Murdoch was speaking in Melbourne, a smaller media player, Kerry Stokes, offered his views. Stokes warned that technology and profit were setting the communication policy agenda rather than broad social issues of national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Britain slumped in the 1960s, Harold Wilson used to like to talk of forging a new nation in the white heat of new technology. It would be ironic if Labor in Australia, in its rush to embrace the whizzbangery of new technology, forgot the social dimension. The member for Werriwa has suggested that our municipal libraries provide, if you like, the public transport system of the information superhighway, but he blithely fails to discuss some of the equally important other issues about the sort of information highway we should build, its ownership and whether or not it will pay for itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Broadband Services Expert Group has estimated the cost of providing an Australia-wide fibre service as being around $10 billion. An investment of such size will need to deliver a genuine return that will benefit its owners and its users. We must make sure that the information superhighway does not bypass the poor but liberates them. Access through libraries will be vitally important. It will be even more important to decide what sort of information network we really need before we build it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion and congratulate the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) for bringing this very important matter before the House. Municipal libraries have developed slowly and amazingly&mdash;even with conservative opposition over the last 20 or 30 years&mdash;so that now almost all Australians have access to municipal libraries. I say almost all Australians because there are some in remote areas of Australia, like the Cape York Peninsula in the Torres Strait in my electorate, who have limited access to municipal libraries. I certainly support that part of the motion which funds the extension of municipal library services to those areas in need and those areas in greatest need.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Remote shires in my electorate such as Cook, Torres, Aurukun and&mdash;to some extent, in terms of remoteness&mdash;Douglas and Mareeba all have low rate bases and would require additional assistance to extend services in both existing technology and certainly new technology. Access is often difficult in remote areas simply because of the lack of mains power supply. That is an additional problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the motion is absolutely necessary if Australia is going to be a more equitable society in the next century than we have achieved in this century. Despite the promise of an eminent technological superhighway, half the world's population still does not have access to telephones. The statistic is higher in Australia, but not everyone has phones. Studies have shown the obvious: those in lower income brackets are less likely to own a computer, and more likely to have an outdated model if they have got one. They are less likely to own hardware such as modems and printers and to have access to advice and support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Libraries could also form an important part of open learning in external studies. Municipal libraries might be able to give access to teaching material to people in remote areas and people who, because of their work commitments or their caring commitments, cannot access the large educational institutions in the capital cities. Such people could also use interactive technology to interact with other students. Libraries of the past have had access to information and databases and now increasingly rely on electronic sources of information. However, if they are going to keep up to date with the information superhighway, they must link to networks. The best example at present is that all Australian connections to the worldwide Internet are through ARRNet, which is in turn restricted to the universities in Australia. Most members of the public, the business community, community groups, and the education sector outside universities have no access to Internet. The trend in access to technology has been largely in the direction of user pays. Pay TV is now the most obvious example of this. The coalition promises to sell Telecom; the British government only recently pulled back from privatising postal services. So it is essential that the second part of the honourable member's motion is carried out. </PARA>

The first is the information poor, who cannot afford to access any of the PC based information services and who become marginalised in society, excluded from participating altogether.

<PARA>My electorate, as with the electorate of the honourable member for Cowper, is on the mid-north coast of New South Wales, which is, and has been over the history of this nation, largely based on the timber industry. The people who operate within the timber industry are honest, hardworking people. They are entitled to the protection of the law. They are entitled to conduct the activities that they are engaged in, which produce wealth for this nation and which generate employment for the people in our areas who need it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They should not be subject to the sorts of acts that we have seen occur in some areas across Australia&mdash;albeit not yet to the level that they may reach. There is quite a number of documented cases of ecoterrorism where expensive equipment has been damaged, costing the industry hundreds of thousands of dollars and where lives have been put in jeopardy because of the actions of these people. The conservation movement is done no favour by the people that are perpetrating these acts of ecoterrorism throughout the timber industry, particularly in northern New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to note some comments that were made in the local newspaper in Coffs Harbour after the address by the member for Cowper a fortnight ago with regard to that debate and what should be happening. A Mr Ducamp said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If Mr Nehl wanted to see timber workers left alone, the government should stop old growth logging, stop the violence in the timber industry and grow hemp and eucalypt plantations.</PARA>
<PARA>For goodness sake, what sort of responsible attitude is that! The important thing we have to highlight to the House and the people of Australia is that we cannot allow people to put themselves above the law. This is what a lot of these people are doing. In recent times in my electorate we have had a number of protests in the forest when people in the conservation movement have been putting at risk not only their own lives with their protests but also the lives of their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The timber industry, as it stands today, goes through a very, very onerous process of getting approvals. There is the EIS process, the FIS process. There are full government inquiries set up by state governments to establish the bona fides of the operation that is going to take place and its impact on the environment and the fauna in the area. Once an area has passed that process, it is legal for those contractors, those operators to go on and conduct their logging operations. They are bound by&mdash;and abide by&mdash;the law of the land. They are entitled to conduct those activities in those areas. They should be entitled to do that without being concerned about their equipment being damaged and spikes being driven into trees that one day will cost a life. One of the policemen in Tasmania said, `It is an accident just waiting to happen. Terrorism of any kind cannot be acceptable in this country and we must, as a community and as a nation, reject acts of criminal vandalism that are affecting jobs and families. Above all we have to reject the life threatening acts of ecoterrorism.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must highlight this to the nation today, and also to the government. This government has a role to play in maintaining the balance and, probably, in providing a bit more incentive. The conservation movement is very keen to see the development of plantation forests&mdash;and I agree with that. That is the way of the future, but we have to encourage this development. We certainly have to lend our support to the people who are given the job of enforcing the law. When these criminal acts take place, police should have the authority to act and we should support them in their actions. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion of the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) that condemns all acts of ecoterrorism in Australia and, in particular, those directed at the forest industries and which consequently endanger the lives of the workers or are extremely detrimental to the wellbeing of their families, small business and the community at large.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In early September, a Dover sawmiller in southern Tasmania was struck in the chest by a log after the saw had hit a galvanised spike. This was the tenth such incident in the last two months. I ask: what has gone wrong? What has gone wrong with society when an individual or group, whichever the case may be, would stoop so low as to endanger another human being's life in such a manner as to secretly and deviously spike a tree deep in the forest? The man in this incident was an employee of Clennet Industries Pty Ltd, which is a Dover regrowth sawmill. Fortunately, he was only winded and not seriously injured. That is this time. What about the next time?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last few months several spikes have been found, mainly in the north Picton area of Tasmania's southern forests. The discovery of these spikes has enraged the forestry sector, the families of the workers and, indeed, the people of Tasmania. It has placed a large cost on the viability of sawmills that have encountered these spiked logs. All the logs that come from the coupes that are known to contain spiked logs are now having to be checked by a metal detector, and this is both expensive and time consuming. However, the question asked may be: what value a human life? I doubt that anyone would say that these extra precautions are not necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though the logs are checked, the tailor in, who is the man who feeds the logs onto the breaking down saw, must double-check them for his own safety and for that of his work mates who work nearby. Always in the back of their minds they are thinking, `What if?' Is this a fair burden to place on the hardworking man and his family? No, it is not. I know exactly what goes on in their minds. I spent all day last Monday visiting sawmills in Bass, and I can imagine what they are thinking as they feed logs into those saws in the south of Tasmania. The result for the Dover mill is obviously a drop in production levels, plus extra responsibilities for the men because of their concerns for each other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Forest Industries Association has offered a $25,000 reward to help catch those responsible for these potentially life threatening acts of ecoterrorism. `Will dad come home?' is often the question asked these days by the wives and families of those who go each day to their jobs in the mills. Who has the right to make these families live a day-to-day terror? Who has the right to put lives in jeopardy on a daily basis? Who dares to place a higher value on trees than a fellow human being? One thing we are sure of is that the conservationists are not to blame. It is for certain that it is someone with a lot of knowledge of the industry. Sooner or later they will be caught. One would dearly hope that happens before there is a fatality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only are metal detectors being used to eliminate some of the risks; the industry itself is undertaking other measures, which will not be made public, to limit the chances of any more incidents taking place. It is extremely frightening not only for the individual but also for the industry and for a way of life in Tasmania and other Australian forest areas. It could be anyone&mdash;someone with a grudge, someone with a distorted view of the industry and reality. I am concerned. Those from both sides of the House who speak to the motion today are concerned. The green movement is concerned. Those who live and work in the forest industry are concerned. The mothers, fathers, wives and children of the men are concerned. We must all work towards the goal of stopping this terror in our forest, stopping those who perpetrate these crimes. Let us work to bring back sanity to the forestry industry and allow those in the industry to go to work each day without the terrible thought that this may be the day their luck runs out.

It is good to see that this motion has attracted the support of all parties in this House and that we are united on this motion. The motion specifically relates to the forest industry.

Certainly, mining is a legal activity. In fact, it is part of the very reason for Bendigo's existence. It also contributed to the welfare and wealth of Victoria in the early days of gold discovery, with Bendigo and Ballarat leading the way. It is a legal activity, and the mining industry has changed its approach to it over the years. It has done some excellent work in reafforestation of mining areas which have been mined for gold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, over that period, the mining industry has been subjected to a lot of interference with its valuable equipment. When such equipment was vandalised, it could have resulted in a life threatening situation and caused damage not only to the workers but also to the other people involved in that mining pursuit. I condemn those acts of eco-terrorism, and I support the motion put forward by the member for Cowper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must as a community and a nation reject any criminal acts of vandalism that affect jobs and families. There is an opportunity for a lot of the people undertaking those acts of vandalism to direct their energy into positive programs. Lord knows that in Australia we have enough other needs to be met in the ecological and environmental area, for example, in the improvement of soil quality. A global assessment of soil degradation in 1991 estimated that 11 per cent, 1.2 billion hectares, of the earth's vegetated surface is suffering from moderate to serious degradation, and that is increasing. If people want to become involved in and protect the environment, they can do so much to assist in that area. Improvement of water quality is another area where people could direct their energy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obvious that those people have plenty of energy to vandalise and destroy equipment, put people's lives at risk and put families and small business at risk. Why do they not get on and do something about the limited amounts of good quality water that are unevenly distributed throughout the world? There is a lot they can do in the area of catchment protection. They could become involved in anti-salinity measures and landcare issues. All of these people who are claiming to be involved and interested in the environment could direct their energies and attention to these areas and do something positive for Australia instead of having this negative attitude and vandalising equipment and placing people's lives at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area those people could direct their attention to is the improvement to green cover throughout Australia by tree planting exercises. There are many organisations throughout my electorate which conduct weekends when people go voluntarily and plant trees. They have the opportunity to go there and become involved in that. I think we as members of this House should encourage the people who are committing these acts of vandalism to become volunteers for the conservation and protection movements that exist and do something positive for the community. Instead of putting up with the constant vandalism and terrorism of the environment, let us do something positive&mdash;encourage these people to become involved in and get right behind proper conservation of soil, water and green cover in Australia. </PARA>

But it is this sort of irresponsible group that believes that human life is expendable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is quite a horrific thought. Anyone who puts lives at risk in trying to put forward a philosophy has to be condemned. We condemn this sort of behaviour in other parts of the world under the terms of human rights, yet these extremists, these so-called environmentalists, have no consideration for the safety of bush workers, their families or the communities in which they live. Those who take away workers' rights to work in a safe and reasonable environment can only be seen to be just as odious as those who deprive people of their freedom or who try to overcome their power problems with force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The green movement has played a useful role up to now. It has sensitised big business to the importance of environmental management; it has alerted politicians to take heed of communities that have particular concerns about environmental degradation; and it has helped, along with others from all sides of parliament, to encourage a more responsible approach to issues about the environment. But some of its supporters have other agendas, and I do not believe it is able to control this lunatic fringe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been 10 incidents in the last few months in Tasmania. All of these have had the potential to kill someone. The latest round of incidents involved the spiking of trees in the forest with galvanised spikes. So, when the timber worker in the mill pushes a log towards the saw, he never knows whether he is going to have pieces of that saw flying around his head. This cannot be tolerated. Although the Greens have condemned the action, a lot of the focus of this activity has come from a very short-sighted view of forestry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent document circulated around parliament not long ago purported to represent the argument that if lobbying were stopped in the Huon and Meander areas in Tasmania the tourist industry would boom. The facts just do not back up the argument. By using these simplistic arguments, people who have little or no knowledge of the industry are encouraged to view forest workers as the enemy; thus guerilla tactics are somehow legitimised by these assumptions. We are in a situation now where ordinary forestry workers, going about their daily work, are having to defend their lives as well as their livelihood. They are patient people. They understand that getting angry does not assist anyone, but they are constantly fighting an uphill battle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The irresponsible paper circulated by the para-greens tried to argue that if forestry were discontinued in certain areas there would be a huge boom in tourism. This is simply not true. Recent survey work covering ecotourism and adventure holidays utilising state forests in Tasmania reveals that the industry currently employs 230 people&mdash;but only in peak season. This industry consists of owner operators providing guided operations into natural locations, with some offering a very basic interpretation of forest ecology. Most have been in operation for only three or four years and have only minimal skills in understanding forest ecology and dynamics. Only four or five Tasmanian ecotourism businesses are big enough to employ up to 15 guides in peak season. Only 25 per cent of the operators are able to survive on ecotourism as their sole income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Though there is a potential for growth, last weekend's Congress on World Ecotourism and Adventure Travel, held in Hobart, signalled that there was a limit to the number of tourists who could be catered for without spoiling the environment. One of the keynote speakers, Jerry Mallett, said that Tasmania could become a world model for ecotourism but that much care must be taken when we sell the very thing we are trying to protect. These comments were reiterated by the state and federal ministers for tourism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the growth here should be in the skills, expertise and care for the natural environment that will allow outsiders to share the Tasmanian experience. It certainly does not bode well for a huge growth in jobs in this industry. By comparison, the forestry industry&mdash;including furniture manufacture and pulp and paper making&mdash;is the largest sector of the total Tasmanian economy. It contributes $1,000 million to the Tasmanian economy and directly and indirectly employs between 20,000 and 25,000 people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Forestry companies have become much more responsible in their activities and are actively seeking to incorporate tourism into their managed forestry sites. They are working within their boundaries and do not impinge on the current world heritage areas.

Those who resort to these measures are acknowledging publicly their failure to win the argument by logical and fair means. They have lost the argument; they have lost the plot.

It is not just the fear that individual forest workers suffer when they go to work each day; many have to camp out on site to protect their equipment.

Over a number of years, those who have raised public awareness of these problems have done so, I believe, from a sound philosophical base and strong moral value.

He was instrumental in creating a public sector in which women could begin to have the same opportunities as men. He applied his management skills and social commitment to advance the cause of reform in the United Nations and to focus the attention of the international community on the needs of women and human rights issues.

While I know that we now have two independents present in the House, I think Ted St John's term in this place shows that there can be independence within the party system. I think it is worth while for those without the system to recognise that there is another way to express their differences. As one who believes that the party system contributes significantly to the stability of government within the Westminster concept and its Australian adaptation, I think that Ted St John's term and the contribution he made serves as an excellent example.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Prime Minister. In view of recent murders of Australian citizens by the notorious Khmer Rouge, why is the government refusing to make a full statement to this parliament about the real situation in Cambodia and the future course of Australian policy, including military assistance? Does the Prime Minister share the deep concerns which then Ambassador Holloway conveyed to the government some months ago in a leaked cable about the prospects for peace and stability in Cambodia?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2646" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BLAXLAND" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Right from the period when Cambodia was left ravaged by the incursions of other forces into that country after the Vietnam War it was always going to be difficult to put that country back together, particularly after the regime of Pol Pot and the legacy that that left and the murder and deprivation of the civilian population that came from that. It was always a terribly difficult task. I think Australia has played a very strong role. Certainly my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, has in terms of seeking to bring about a process where there could be some real authority brought to the government of Cambodia via a democratic election and the processes of democracy taking place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For countries such as Cambodia it is very difficult to draw down any public authority when there is no recognised government and where only people who operate political factions or who have had power by virtue of their family position, such as the royal family, have governed. This has meant that managing Cambodia or trying to get some kind of consensus about how it is governed was a difficult thing to do. That is why the peace accords were pursued with such vigour by Australia and why as a consequence that election gave the opportunity to the elected representatives of the people of Cambodia to form a government and to operate that government in a manner conducive to progress, social development and human happiness in that country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As in any switch to a democracy or with any authority being vested in particular leaders, particularly where there are substantial given general authority by the election, getting a coalescence of view about how the country should be governed has been difficult, and I think the content and import of the cable which the Leader of the Opposition refers to reflect some of the disquiet by the then ambassador about the progress being made by the government of Cambodia in consolidating the country and improving progress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think one thing is clear; that is, responsibility for the tragic death of David Wilson and his two travelling companions lies solely with the Khmer Rouge and its leaders, like Pol Pot and General Paet, who pursue power by terrorist tactics. That has been maintained as a policy by them despite the willingness of the international community to involve the Khmer Rouge in the processes of democracy. Indeed, in the visit I made to Cambodia, the Khmer Rouge was represented at a lunch with Prince Sihanouk. The Khmer Rouge had every opportunity of being involved with the process and taking their chances in a democratic sense with support of themselves in the community. It has rejected that course and as a consequence pursued the sorts of tactics which it is currently pursuing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will shortly consider how Australia can best help prevent a repetition of the kind of tragedy we have just witnessed by helping to build the capacity of the Cambodian armed forces against the challenge from the Khmer Rouge. The alternative is to leave ordinary Cambodians to suffer at its hands. The government will make decisions on this within the next few weeks and after consultation with other relevant countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can I say on the tragedy itself that Senator Evans and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials in Cambodia and in Canberra put a determined and persistent effort into securing the release of the hostages. I do not think they could have done more. As a consequence, I would like to pay tribute to the work in arduous circumstances performed by the consular and other staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and by the Australian Federal Police throughout this period. This, of course, will not bring any comfort to the families of those bereaved by the deaths which occurred at the hands of the Khmer Rouge. But at least it should be known that, from our point of view, the government took this matter seriously and did everything it could to pursue the release of David Wilson and his colleagues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the government's point of view, we will be considering how best we may support the process of democracy in Cambodia and the Cambodian government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs and it relates to the same issue that the Prime Minister has just spoken about. Should the Australian government continue to aid Cambodia when it is clear that the Cambodian government cannot protect the lives of foreign citizens and when it appears to be having great difficulty in being effective?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2647" SPEAKER="Bilney The Hon G.N." NAMEID="RE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="KINGSTON" MINISTERIAL="DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION & PACIFIC ISLAND AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RE4">Mr BILNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister in his last answer dealt very effectively with the question of possible military aid to the Cambodian armed forces to assist them to combat the menace posed by the Khmer Rouge, and I have nothing to add on that aspect. At the same time, I emphasise that our program of civilian development assistance to Cambodia will not be and cannot be allowed to be derailed by this senseless and brutal murder.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past months, we have acknowledged in the civilian aid field the profound problems faced by the Cambodian government. It is quite unrealistic to expect that those problems will be solved in a fully functioning democracy after 20 years of war and genocide. We do not contemplate cancelling programs which bring basic health care and immunisation to children in a country which has an infant mortality rate of 117 per 1,000 and help to mothers, who die in childbirth at a rate of more than one in 100&mdash;programs which provide the poorest communities with education, skills and credit in a country where the average annual income is $US200 and the adult literacy rate is less than 20 per cent. We do not plan to reduce programs which rid the country of 10 million landmines which are waiting to cripple or kill farmers and their children, or programs which aim to improve the functioning and accountability of a fledgling government suffering from serious but predictable problems. If we do that, the murderers of David Wilson will have had their way; they will have won the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last budget, Australian assistance to Cambodia was more than doubled to around $92 million over the next four years. Targeted areas of the greatest need are repairing bridges on the national roads; establishing a fair and equitable exam system in primary and secondary schools and upgrading the university; providing an agricultural extension system for poor farmers and their families, who still constitute 85 per cent of the population; immunisation programs; assistance, importantly, for the good work which Australian non-governmental organisations are doing in Cambodia; and, very importantly, remaining a very large contributor to the demining operations which are essential to bring land back into production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, to answer the honourable member, we have no intention of turning our back on Cambodia at this time. We intend to assist in its return to stability and security. Like the Prime Minister, may I too add my condolences to those already expressed to the Wilson family. All Australia shares their grief.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. In his recent statements on Cambodia, Senator Gareth Evans has said that elements of the Thai military continue to support the Khmer Rouge and that the Khmer Rouge are able to seek sanctuary within Thailand with impunity. Given that easy access to such sanctuary clearly hampers the capacity of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces to counter the Khmer Rouge, will the Prime Minister signify the importance with which he treats this matter, as he suggested in his answer to the first question, by taking the matter up with the Thai Prime Minister when he meets him next week at the APEC leaders meeting in Bugor. If not, why not?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I took it up with the Thai Prime Minister when I visited Thailand on the last occasion, saying that the Australian government has been less than pleased by the commercial and logistical support given by some figures in the Thai armed forces and in commerce to elements connected with the Khmer Rouge along the border. I was assured by the Prime Minister that that support did not come from the government of Thailand. It is, I think, from his remarks, a bewildering problem for him and his government, as it has been for the community of the area, including Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am quite happy to assure the honourable member that I will be taking the issue up again with the Thai Prime Minister when I see him at the APEC meeting next week. Given that this issue has received so much attention in recent weeks, not just in Australia but round the region, it is an opportunity to again reinforce the fact that the Khmer Rouge are getting support from external sources, some of them in Thailand. Without that support it would severely, or at least materially, curtail their activities. It is a great pity, I think, that this support has continued, particularly after the peace accords and the elections. No doubt a lot of it is simply corruption where there has been a trade in forest products and gems and, obviously, cabals of power within sections of the Thai military.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At any rate, let me repeat that the Thai Prime Minister assured me that the government of Thailand supported our view that external support for the Khmer Rouge would leave them in a position where they have to fend for themselves and earn support within the Cambodian community and that there was no support for such activity by the Thai government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very important program which enjoys bipartisan support and which is strongly supported by the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. The discussions I have had with the medical profession have been generally positive. It means that, at the pharmacy, on request or on the advice of the pharmacist, a generic brand can be substituted. But, if the doctor believes there are sound, clinical reasons for no substitution, he or she can write that on the prescription form, and the drug will be given according to the original prescription. This has the capacity to save a considerable amount of money. The out-of-pocket costs above and beyond those provided for in the pharmaceutical benefits schedule will be lower, and that is particularly beneficial to low income earners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was mightily surprised when the President of the AMA, Dr Brendan Nelson, was apparently opposed to the scheme. At least two newspapers reported that with some confidence. As a result, a number of groups responded very angrily, including pensioners, because they are amongst those supporting it very strongly. I was surprised to see that Dr Nelson was alleged to have said that he and most other GPs would get `no substitute' stamps&mdash;in other words, they would routinely stamp every prescription, thereby preventing the scheme from operating. `Exceptions,' he said, `would be made for needy people.' The response to that I think was appropriate. For example, the Council on the Ageing said that it was much offended by the view that the AMA would administer a `new poor law'; that it would decide who was needy and who was not and would then, in a very patronising way, decide which prescriptions would be stamped `no substitute' and which would not, rather than on the basis of clinical need. I think that is a most extraordinary outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard various statements during the week that members of the medical profession were worried about this measure because drug companies provided for their continuing education and their conferences. It seemed a very strange view that the less well-off in our community, pensioners in particular, should be paying for medical conferences. I found that view extraordinary. I am pleased to say that the majority of practitioners who contacted me said just the opposite. They were very supportive of the scheme, and they were surprised at the apparent position of the AMA. It appears that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> got it wrong and that Dr Brendan Nelson was not saying that at all&mdash;at least that is the view that Dr Brendan Nelson has put in his press release.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Nelson is now saying&mdash;I am pleased to announce this just in case it has not been generally noticed&mdash;that the AMA is not planning to undermine generic prescribing, that the AMA is not planning to tell doctors to prescribe only brand name drugs and that the AMA has not suggested that doctors order rubber stamps stating `not for substitution' to be placed on every script. I am very pleased at that. There appears to have been a misunderstanding. That is the kindest interpretation. If not, the President of the AMA has responded to his own members and to members of the community, and changed his mind.</PARA>

There is all this sort of hankering after a bit of partial analysis which looks at one level of income or one stream of payments, but not looking at the totality of an accord with tax cuts, transfer payments and the rest is an analysis not really worth bothering with. That is why the government, when these things come along, basically flicks them, because everybody out there who is low paid or has been on the bottom end knows that the support which has come by way of this government in more employment, a rise in household disposable income, transfer payments, tax cuts, wage improvements and the safety net have all made a tremendous difference.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In his speech to the Liberal women's conference, the Leader of the Opposition said that Labor was biased in favour of working women and that the government has sought to drive a wedge between women in the home and those who work outside of it. But not everyone agrees with the Leader of the Opposition, including his shadow minister responsible for the status of women. The honourable member for Pearce is concerned that it is not the government which is being divisive but rather the Leader of the Opposition. Immediately after Mr Downer's address, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> carried the following report:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mrs Moylan had warned that the coalition not cause divisions among women through policies dumping on women wanting a career.</PARA>
<PARA>Good on you! Not only is Mr Downer divisive on this, he is wrong. It is not true that the government is biased in a favour of working women, but it is true that the government is biased in favour of low income families, as I have been saying over and over again today. Eligibility for government assistance is largely determined by the level of family income, irrespective of whether that income is earned by one or two parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the same speech on the status of women, the Leader of the Opposition reiterated his view that the ALP's decision to ensure that we have women candidates in 35 per cent of winnable seats by the year 2002 is discriminatory and patronising. According to a Saulwick poll this morning, 60 per cent of women do not agree with the Leader of the Opposition. What it is patronising to assume is that only 10 per cent of the women members of this House are members on the basis of merit: that is, the others had not enough merit to warrant membership of the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I made reference to the fact that, at his conference the other day, the Leader of the Opposition was out talking about the reform of the Fraser government, while we support paying family allowances directly to the mother. But then he is adopting motions to go back to the tax system for payments to families. The tax system invariably gives the greatest benefit to the highest taxpayer who is, in the main, the person who earns the income. Certainly in single income families, this is more often than not the male. The coalition would be back to the old days when family assistance went to the male earner in the work force, rather than directly to the parent&mdash;usually the mother&mdash;caring for children at home. Again we see this dichotomy of view about the interests of women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has extended the number of child-care places from 40,000 to well over a quarter of a million. We have also introduced a generalised child-care rebate. This sort of notion that the way to advance the interests of women in society is to adopt a political bias in favour of rhetoric which says that the policies of the government are biased in favour of working women is cynical in the extreme. The member for Bennelong is out there talking about his brand of tax policies when in fact, as we know, his policies&mdash;by his own self-admission&mdash;came from the most conservative leader the coalition has ever had.

Has the minister received any advice concerning the potential impact of the implementation of a single domestic aviation market with New Zealand on the earning capacity and profitability of Qantas? If so, does this advice indicate that a decision to honour the agreement with the New Zealand government would have undermined the price received for the Commonwealth's forthcoming Qantas float? Given the material nature of the effect of these matters on the value of Qantas, will the minister provide potential investors with a firm indication of the government's commitment to its `open skies' policy prior to the issue of the prospectus for the forthcoming float?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The performance of those opposite on this question of the trans-Tasmanian aviation arrangements could not have been better or put more strongly if they had been paid lobbyists for Air New Zealand. That is the truth of it. You performed one after another, particularly the Leader of the National Party, in there saying, `What about New Zealand?' Let me say this: this government makes no apology for insisting that all the provisions under the memorandum of understanding are fully and completely complied with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that this does have some implications for Qantas. It does have some implications for Ansett. It has some real implications which are perhaps best reflected in looking at the future profitability projections of Air New Zealand. It is quite fair to say that Air New Zealand expected to do very handsomely as a result of the memorandum of understanding&mdash;not by competing equally with Qantas but, instead, by taking maximum advantage of on-flying ability; that is, carrying passengers to and from Australia internationally as well as cherry picking our Australian domestic routes. The fact is that all of the conditions of the MOU have not been complied with. We do not have the one aviation market that was envisaged in the MOU, nor do we have any real progress towards one market by way of airline equity between our two countries.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for his question. I am pleased to say that there has been a huge breakthrough in developing a national training system for this country. At meetings that were held last week with state and territory education ministers, the Commonwealth secured agreement to implement, from 1 January next year, a single national system for training. It is called the Australian vocational training system. As a consequence of this, for the first time school leavers and industry will have a comprehensive structured national system of entry level training; and for the first time people undergoing training will get a nationally recognised certificate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under one umbrella, as a result of this agreement, the new system consolidates and opens new pathways by which skills and competencies can be developed through education, training and workplace experience. The agreement involves new areas of opportunity between school and work, but it also allows people to continue learning throughout their working lives. I am pleased to say that industry is fully supportive of this agreement, which is based on nationally endorsed industry and enterprise standards. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the ACTU, the Business Council of Australia and the Metal Trades Industry Association have all given this initiative their strong backing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement goes further because it will cut out duplication in course accreditation. As a result of this, standards and curriculum developed in one state can now be recognised and applied nationally. It will also assist the major expansion of places announced in the government's Working Nation statement. This agreement is a clear example of further progress on micro-economic reform. It shows that government is willing and able to respond to the needs of industry. It gives practical effect to the principle of mutual recognition, and it creates a national approach to skill formation across government and across education and training sectors. I commend the detail of the agreement to the House and hope that we do not see any silly statements coming from the other side.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I referred those documents immediately, and they are the subject of investigation right now. When the honourable member raised this matter in the House in May, Yanda was already under investigation by the Civil Aviation Authority. I am able to inform the House that the Civil Aviation Authority had identified deficiencies in relation to aspects of the Yanda operation, including a maintenance control manual and the operations manual. I am further advised by the Civil Aviation Authority that individual deficiencies such as this rarely lead to a situation that would warrant suspension or cancellation of the air operator's certificate. Usually education and counselling are sufficient to eliminate less serious deficiencies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of Yanda, the Civil Aviation Authority initiated action plans to eliminate the deficiencies, and the CAA allowed Yanda a short period to rectify the deficiencies. The company was given a deadline of 31 October 1994 when its AOC expired. The Civil Aviation Authority considered that, in the short term, safety levels were not jeopardised. The Civil Aviation Authority advises that it had hoped Yanda would have been able to demonstrate a sustained period of compliance. However, the Civil Aviation Authority concluded that maintenance control, check and training regulatory breaches had continued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the circumstances the Civil Aviation Authority was not satisfied that Yanda had complied with the civil aviation regulations relating to safety. The CAA, in these circumstances, decided not to issue Yanda a new AOC. Yanda has a 28-day period in which to apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of the decision. I suggest to the honourable member and anyone else who has some problem with this process that they take it up with the parliamentary inquiry which I authorised to pursue all such allegations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been looking forward to raising this matter concerning the crisis in aged care in Australia, the problems with people and relatives affected by dementia and also the plight of the unsung heroes in Australia&mdash;that is, those people who are caring for the ill, the aged and the disabled in their own homes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of brief background, 11.1 per cent of Australia's population is over 65 years of age. That represents 1.8 million Australians. Of those, about 75,000 Australians are currently in nursing homes. Those nursing homes are not able to provide the care that is needed in every case, especially for those who suffer from the tragedy of dementia and associated problems. Nursing homes in my state of Victoria are currently being forced to take more and more patients with dementia but do not have the funds or the physical facilities to adequately care for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also a tragedy that in Australia a large number of patients who are suffering from dementia are at present being cared for in psychiatric institutions or organisations and many of them, regretfully, are being drugged in order to control them when they should be in an environment where they are given proper care and encouragement. In many cases it is well documented that dementia sufferers can live a reasonably happy and active life without being restrained or drugged if given the proper care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other frightening element that I want to highlight today is the tragic error of this government in the way it is approaching the provision of care for the aged and the disabled and the inequities that are arising as a result of that. Mr Deputy Speaker, did you know that, if you stay at home and look after your aged mother or demented spouse or disabled or chronically ill child yourself, the government pays about $26.60 a week in domiciliary nursing care benefits plus a means tested carers pension of $159 a week? That is only if the person being cared for is over the age of 16 in certain circumstances. There are anomalies I will not have time to go into in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the relative or disabled person is placed in a nursing home, the government becomes financially involved to the extent of between $382 and $700 per week&mdash;that is taxpayers' money&mdash;in subsidies for the care and maintenance of the relative, friend or child involved. In some cases, if the relative is in receipt of a pension he or she can pay 87 per cent of that pension towards the costs of the nursing home. As you will see from those figures, there is an astronomical additional cost to the government in caring for people in nursing homes and institutions compared with the cost of providing some assistance to families and relatives for caring for their relatives at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This leaves a very heavy burden of care on the invisible army of 1.5 million devoted relatives and friends in Australia who give their time and make many sacrifices to care for the chronically ill, the aged and the disabled persons in their own homes. Seventy per cent of the 1.5 million Australians in this invisible army are women. Tragically, research indicates that many of those carers&mdash;the unsung heroes, the invisible army&mdash;are themselves subjected to poverty, isolation and failing health because of the task they take unto themselves. It is true that some of those carers have contemplated suicide because of the pressure on them. Carers are the poorest and most ignored section of our community, yet they are doing a marvellous job for the people who cannot care for themselves, whether they be relatives or friends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it rather worrying to say the least that this government, in developing policies for the care of the aged, people with dementia and disabled people, is steering the ship towards establishing provision of care that is far more expensive than the provision of care by carers in their own homes. I believe this is an urgent issue and the government is overdue in addressing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is this nation going to continue to provide financial incentives for people to put a relative or friend into a nursing home? The cost to the Commonwealth and the taxpayer is far greater if that happens. Or is it going to re-examine the ways in which it helps carers to stay at home and look after people at home? I believe it should. After all, it is true that most elderly and disabled people are far happier if they are able to spend their time with their relatives and friends at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that in some cases it is not possible to continue to care for these people at home and when that happens the bullet has to be bitten and additional care in a hostel, nursing home or other type of facility must be provided. We have to have a dual system. It alarms me to look at the figures and see that the taxpayer through this government is being asked to support a system that encourages people to be placed in nursing homes rather than one that provides incentive and assistance to families to persevere for longer with their disabled or aged relative in their homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What sort of a society are we if we provide a financial disincentive for home carers and a financial incentive for the transfer of aged people to institutions? I do not believe the Australian community wants to see that model develop, but it is the course this government is allowing health care and the provision of planning for aged and disabled people to take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know of a family in Wodonga with a severely disabled daughter under the age of 16. Both mother and father have given up their work to care for their little daughter, who is very ill. It is only as a result of the 24-hour care provided by the mother and father that this little girl is still alive. The sacrifices this family is making to support their child at home are worth observing and certainly deserve commendation. These people are being penalised by a too rigid system of allowances for parents with disabled children. Even their pensions or support allowances are means tested, so if they have a bit of money in the bank the interest on that is counted against their income. Yet if these parents give up the care of this child and the child goes into a hospital or institution, the 24-hour, seven-day-a-week cost of caring for this child in the institution would be, in my estimate, 10 to 15 times more than the pitiful amount now being paid to these parents to help them exist&mdash;to feed themselves and their other children, and to care for this little girl. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the government must urgently re-examine its policies in these areas and provide a much more flexible system of enabling parents and relatives to cope in a dignified way with looking after a child who, as I said, in any other circumstance would have to be placed in a much more expensive environment of care, fully paid for by the taxpayer&mdash;and perhaps up to 15 times more expensive. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

While unemployment continues, the people of Australia can be certain of one thing: they will be cared for far more compassionately by this government than they would by those who sit opposite, should they ever manage to find their way by some misfortune back into government.

She looked at me&mdash;I was sitting next to Senator David Brownhill&mdash;and said, `Bureaucracy does not hold sway here. There is no income test here. There is no assets test here. So, if you need a pair of shoes, go and pick them up.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it was my turn to speak I thanked the women for their ideas but pointed out that had Senator David Brownhill and member Eric Fitzgibbon quietly tiptoed down to the back of the room, gone through all the shoes, picked out a good pair each and trotted off into the day they would have said, `Look at those two bloody greedy politicians'&mdash;and they would have been totally justified. Any thinking Australian realises the necessity for an income test, an assets test. No Australian believes that we should be giving the pension to millionaires. I think I managed to make that point quite well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, that is not Tim Fischer's view. Up in Quirindi they are saying that the pension should be given to everyone, but what is Tim Fischer saying? The Leader of the National Party is saying that the pension should be given to no-one; that we should go down the Asian track, where the nuclear family looks after the extended family. A husband and wife are supposed not only to look after their own kids but also to look after grandma and grandpa as well. So there we have it; some people up in my electorate who would normally vote National Party want the pension for everyone and the Leader of the National Party wants the pension for no-one. </PARA>

<PARA>I still stand by what I wrote a week prior: it is the business of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) to look after the interests of Australians first and foremost. I first made that comment in relation to the way in which the plight of the Gillespie children was dealt with. This is a very different circumstance but the duty of the foreign affairs minister is still to look after the interests of Australians first. There were many of us in the opposition at the time the plan was floated, with all the aggrandisement and all the claims that this could end up with a Nobel prize, who disagreed with the policy of in any way, shape or form legitimising the Khmer Rouge. I stand by my interjection today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard the diatribe, fantasy and fairytales of the Prime Minister as he told the people of Australia that they had never had it so good and how successful his policies had been.

Tell that to people who are in small business struggling to stay in existence. It is a funny thing, is it not, that the Australian people do not understand how Bob Menzies, whom the Prime Minister likes to deride&mdash;and perhaps we are starting to see the real reason&mdash;who gave great service to this country retired unable to buy a house that his constituents thought was decent for a former Prime Minister to live in.

He had the hide to get up here today and talk about the irrelevance of the poverty test and the poverty line. </PARA>

Do not say you are at arms length, Minister, because you have already managed to stand down the Chief Executive Officer. It is rather like shutting the gate after the horse has bolted. But to stand there and say that no action was taken against Yanda Airlines between May and October because a member of the opposition did not give you access to material that he had when you, as the minister, could get it from your authority any day or hour you wished simply will not wash.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The substance of my grievance today is the building of a national identity and the identification of the particular national policies that will contribute most strongly to the building of that national identity. With the year 2001 and the centenary of Federation only seven years away, it is I believe timely to debate these matters and bring them onto the national agenda.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To develop a national identity, national policies require coherence and inclusion and a theoretical framework that actually works. Labor governments in the past have attempted, not always deliberately so, to build a national identity. It happened in the period of reconstruction after the Second World War. The Snowy Mountains scheme is a resultant major icon of that reconstruction. It happened again in 1983 when Hawke in the election speech spoke about national reconciliation, recovery and reconstruction. It happened with One Nation in 1992 focusing on national infrastructure and again in 1994 with Working Nation focusing on the long-term unemployed. Intertwined with One Nation and Working Nation, there has been debate on the republic, the flag, native title and the preparations for the centenary of Federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that those four issues are certainly important in the evolving development of an Australian national identity. It is therefore pertinent to ask the fundamental question as to whether the majority of the Australian people consider those four issues as the unifying themes necessary to build a national identity. My short answer is yes, no and maybe. In other words, the response is somewhat confused. However, I do believe there are logical reasons why this is the case. Human beings, such as all of us in here and outside, crave vision and consistent and coherent behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All human behaviour can be described within a trinity of ideas, strategies and outcomes. Of course, the words `ideas', `strategies' and `outcomes' can be substituted with other words. `Ideas' can be `rationale', `policies', `philosophy', `vision' or `goals'. `Strategies' can be `procedures' or `process', and `outcomes' can be `programs' or `tasks'. Human endeavour will not be as successful if part of the trinity is missing or if the trinity is not coherent. Coherent policy development demands vision and ideas. To make sense of any vision, a translation process to coherent strategies and procedures needs to occur. Then and only then can identifiable outcomes be spelled out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can all learn from the past to more effectively plan for the future and, in the process, include the overwhelming majority of Australians. In terms of postwar reconstruction, national identity was a side issue. Basically, the whole program was outcome driven. Ideas and strategies were not the main game. However, it did leave a great legacy and icon in the Snowy Mountains scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I contend that Hawke's election speech in 1983 was not ideas driven. Reconciliation and recovery are strategies and, obviously, reconstruction is an outcome. That is why, although initially very attractive, it was never going to be sustained as the basis for developing a national identity. One Nation in 1992 was certainly ideas driven. Unfortunately, in my view, it lacked coherent strategies that could be understood by the nation. This inevitably led to what was perceived as a confused set of outcomes. Working Nation in 1994 was a response to long-term unemployment. It was certainly coherent in terms of ideas, strategies and outcomes. It could have been about building a national identity but it was not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The approach taken with Working Nation was one of synthesis rather than analysis. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with taking a synthesis approach, but there is a very big difference if you are trying to promote a national identity. Synthesis, by its very nature, excludes. Analysis includes. Synthesis is identifying a part of an idea and then maybe or maybe not working towards a bigger picture, but without knowing what the big picture really is. As an approach, that is its great weakness. By contrast, analysis is identifying the whole idea and then identifying the parts that make up the whole. In other words, whatever is being discussed is always related to the bigger picture. To conceive a national identity, the theoretical framework must be by analysis. It must be ideas driven, it must have strategies coherent with the vision and it must have identifiable outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next question to ask is: where do you apply the focus for identifying unifying themes that will build a national identity? I believe that that focus is fairly straightforward. It should focus on the Australian people, the Australian national assets and a productive future for all Australians. The next question to ask is: what are the national portfolio areas to best address that focus? Again, I believe they are fairly straightforward. If we are talking about the Australian people, it will be education; if we are talking about the Australian national assets, we are talking about the environment; and, if we are talking about a productive future for all Australians, we are talking about the economy&mdash;in particular, transport and communications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I see it, Australians want a coherent view of the future&mdash;one in which they can participate. The year 2001 can be the most significant celebration in our history. Symbols are certainly important but they are only part of the story. I am quite confident that Australians will respond to a long-term vision for this country. As a nation, we need to initiate a major visionary, technological, scientific venture. The project should unify and more than likely will be pretty basic, concentrating on water, energy, waste, urban and regional development, transport, environmental management and technology, and food production. For example, if we could invent a sewerage system that did not use water and could be applied to an urban environment, we would become the richest people on earth. Australians will respond enthusiastically to a vision of future icons. That scientific advance would focus not only on research and development but also on manufacturing and marketing on a global scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a revolution in education in the last 11 years under this Labor government. There are 533,000 students in higher education and 1.8 million students in further education and TAFE, and year 12 retention rates are near 80 per cent. But one group&mdash;the five- to 15-year-old age group&mdash;could rightly be described as the forgotten people in the Australian community. The expenditure on that group&mdash;which is mainly the responsibility of the states&mdash;has fallen dramatically, particularly in the last five or six years. That makes the education area weak. It is perhaps a poor investment in the future in terms of federal investment in higher and TAFE education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the environment, environmental technology and management is regarded to be worth a world market of $US400 billion by the end of this decade. The current value is $US200 billion. Australia's share of that is that it produces some $US200 million and imports $US800 million. The Japanese have a program called new earth 21. They hope to be the world leaders in environmental management and technology by the year 2000. It is an area in which Australia should play a strong role. Germany and the United States are big players in that area and Australia should be a strong player, too. When you look at transport in this country, you sometimes wonder why we, as a trading nation, carry only 7 1/2 per cent of our own trade and why our international carrier, ANL&mdash;the only participant in international containerisation&mdash;carries 3 1/2 per cent. They are issues that, along with transport, need to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To conclude, I repeat the main points I have made. Australia needs, wants and is ripe to build its own unique national identity. The approach must be by analysis, not synthesis. There must be a vision. The strategies that evolve need to be congruent with the vision, and the outcomes must be identifiable and congruent with the vision and strategies. The focus should be on the Australian people, the Australian national assets and the Australian view of the future. The policy areas that will best assist the building of a national identity are education, the environment and the economy&mdash;in particular, transport and communications. I thank the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to grieve today about many of the disadvantages facing Cranbourne residents and businesses in their use of Australia's telephone system. For many years, there has been both an actual cost and a perceived disadvantage in locating a business in Cranbourne, since the area is partially in the 059 and the 03 telephone zones. Many of Cranbourne's residents are young and first home buyers. They might have previously lived with their parents in suburbs like Sunshine or Eltham and now be faced with additional telephone costs to contact their families in the Melbourne telephone zone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the latest Department of Social Security figures show that there are at least 3,500 newstart and jobsearch beneficiaries in a labour force of 40,000, any disincentive to firms locating within the city of Cranbourne means that employees or job seekers incur high transport costs, often having to travel to distant suburbs of Melbourne for employment. As a result, many Cranbourne households must have two cars. This problem will be only partly resolved with the late December opening of the electrified rail link, because not all transport needs can be met by the public transport system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When phone calls made using Telecom as the carrier go beyond the area covered by the Clayton, Croydon and Dandenong exchanges, they are charged at community call or STD rates. I note that Optus is now planning to offer timed local calls, which may be of some use to local businesses or residents if they typically make many short calls. Optus has stated that its rates will be less than 25c a call when available from 1996 or thereabouts. However, this particular Optus initiative will not really solve the problem of Cranbourne businesses and residents making lengthy calls into, say, the centre of Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> My office recently had some discussions with Telecom. It may commence trials of what it calls its Reachout 100 plan this month. This plan, if approved by Austel after Telecom has submitted it, will allow customers to pay 25c per call for a local call and a flat rate of $1 for a call within 100 kilometres of the customer's home exchange. Telecom tells me that it is considering introducing a new plan more relevant to Cranbourne and similar outer suburban areas called Reachout 75. It will again be a mix of a fixed local call fee of 25c, together with a fee of perhaps 50c or 55c for calls beyond the local area and up to 75 kilometres away from the Cranbourne exchange. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last financial year, the government creamed off $834 million in tax receipts from Telecom and $738 million in dividend payments, or almost half the amount of the second round of supposed tax cuts proposed by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that were put on the never-never. The cost to Telecom of these new tariffs is a lot less than the yearly payments the government receives from Telecom. On 30 August, Austel disallowed a previous effort by Telecom to introduce what it also called a Reachout 75 tariff, which was then structured on the basis in effect of a flat untimed 37c charge for every call within 75 kilometres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Effective competition must occur among Australia's telecommunications providers. The second carrier, Optus, is not yet profitable, although that is in line with its business plan. Vodafone and resellers such as AAP Telecommunications are growing quickly but are still only tiny by comparison with Telecom. An umpire like Austel has to be vigilant to ensure that Telecom does not abuse its still very large amount of power over both residential and business markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I was a little intrigued to see that on 30 August Austel issued a media release after disallowing Telecom's first attempt at introducing a Reachout 75 service. Just over 30 per cent of the customers surveyed by Telecom in Cranbourne had expressed interest in taking up this proposed tariff option, as it was then known. In that release, Austel's acting chairman, Neil Tuckwell, said that one of the reasons Austel disallowed Reachout 75 was that it placed a constraint on the consumer's choice of preferred long distance carrier. But he also said that Austel's decision did not preclude further tariffs which may have some of the features of Reachout 75. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My discussions with Austel since then indicate that there is a pretty good chance that it will allow this new Reachout 75 tariff under the Telecommunications Act 1991. Austel must make a decision on a tariff within 15 working days of a carrier's submitting a suggestion, although another phone company can object. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend Telecom for being innovative in developing this new proposal to bring down the cost of calls for Cranbourne residents and Cranbourne businesses. Together with some of the good deals on offer from Optus, Vodafone and others, it will help to reduce Cranbourne residents' cost disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am still concerned that Cranbourne cannot enjoy complete local call access to the rest of the Melbourne metropolitan area. I understand Telecom's argument that existing boundaries for local calls are allegedly only exceeded in terms of areas covered by those in Greater London. Telecom also says&mdash;and probably rightly&mdash;that, if it were to extend local call boundaries in Melbourne, it would have to do so in Brisbane and Sydney. Australia's population density is much lower than London's. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps it is time for the government to somehow require Telecom to provide a local call area where populations expand quickly to outer suburbia as part of a community service obligation for which a specific budget payment could be made. The shadow minister for communications and the arts has said that, whatever form telephone ownership takes under a coalition government, existing community service obligations will be maintained. At present, though, the question still remains why Cranbourne's 45 rail kilometres from Melbourne is not wholly within the Melbourne 03 zone when Berwick's 44.5 kilometres from the city is. Half a kilometre can certainly mean a lot of difference in telephone call costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 19 October, I drew the attention of members to the discriminatory price increases by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS> for areas where it faces telephone book competition, such as Melbourne, and areas where it does not, such as the 059 area, of which most of Cranbourne forms a part. I placed an order for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS> telephone directories for the 059 area in April 1994. When I had to look up a particular name in these <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS>, I noticed that after page 192 my copy suddenly jumped to page 321. After continuing in order to page 384, page 257 suddenly appeared until page 560 at the end. It would have been bad luck if a consumer were trying to find gates, fencing materials or safety glasses or a business wanted to clean its grease traps, because these 64 pages were missing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On many occasions, printing or binding errors would be picked up by the printers, proofreaders or quality control officers. Generally, Telecom's printers, Wilke Directories of Clayton, do a good job. Mr Kerry Kinnane, Telecom's directories manager at Box Hill, has been courteous in trying to track down just how many books have been affected. It is one more reason for businesses in Cranbourne to be a little annoyed. Some of these potential customers who receive a particular book might look up another category that has not been omitted or use an alternative way of finding a business or service. So companies advertising in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS> lose the effective chance to service those customers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the worst cases, as Mr Wally Rothwell of the Australian Telecommunication Users Group says, firms that are omitted from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS> go out of business, so it really does not matter if Yellow Pages offers them free TV or radio advertising. While I grieve for the problem Cranbourne residents and businesses face with the extra costs incurred in their telephone bills, I hope that these differentials will reduce over the next year as new tariffs are gradually introduced by Telecom, Optus and other service providers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with great sadness that I rise to speak, on indulgence, on the death on Thursday last of an extraordinary man, Dr Peter Wilenski AC. I first knew Peter in the days when we were student politicians together. He was the President of the Sydney University Students Representative Council and I was the president of the same body in Adelaide. In the following year, he went on to head the National Union of Australian University Students, NUAUS. He was the president and I was the international vice-president. I mention these matters because I believe it was in those very early days that one saw the great themes and the great passions which would come to dominate Peter's life and to which he devoted his life, to the extraordinary benefit of this country and to the foundation and enhancement of many aspects of our contemporary Australian civilisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of those themes, perhaps the most striking to me at that time, being an Adelaide boy who had really never moved out of Adelaide, was Peter's internationalism. He was deeply committed to the idea of international cooperation to solve problems in the world. He was deeply active in those causes and in enlisting others to them. I was so enlisted and to him I really owe much of what I have done in my life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Peter was deeply committed to the idea of equality. He was of course Jewish and came to Australia at the age of about four. He often used to tell the story of how at the age of two he took his parents from Lodz in Poland, where the pogroms were well and truly on, and brought them through China and India, finally ending up in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He believed in equality between races. We both joined the Labor Party at about the same time. Why? Because the Labor Party had a plank of White Australia. We joined it in order to amend that plank, which we, along with a great number of other people, succeeded in doing in the fullness of time. Peter's views about women were very much too feminist for those days of machismo amongst students, of which we were all guilty but he less than most. Peter was also committed to health. He graduated in medicine and I graduated in dentistry. We both had similar views about a society in which access to health services was effectively restricted by one's wealth. That was a cause to which he devoted time as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third great thing which dominated his life was the idea of public service. It never really occurred to him that he should go out into the world of business or the profession of medicine, in which he graduated first. He saw government and public service as a way of changing lives of disadvantaged people and of creating opportunities. I am sad to say that this concept has been lost in some ways in the Public Service. But he devoted his life to making the Public Service that relevant engine of reform and innovation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Peter pursued these themes not with bitterness or invective but as a gentle man whose main weapons were reasoned argument, research, writing and a devastating wit. He had a sense of humour which I found enchanting and which was often a better weapon than anything I could have thought of. Quite soon after I met him we were elected by this fine body the National Union of Australian University Students to be delegates of a body called NYCA, the National Youth Council of Australia, which had a membership with an average age of about 60, I dare say. I remember the Boy Scouts' representative was certainly over 70. The membership was more or less equally divided between, on the one hand, bodies of the persuasion of the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott)&mdash;that is, the Boys Brigade, the Boy Scouts, the Girl Guides and so forth, who believed in a monarchy forever&mdash;and, on the other hand, those who were of a religious bent, such as the Student Christian Movement and the Young Catholic Workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proceedings at this meeting began with a very long debate on how proceedings at the meeting should begin. One camp said that we should begin with the playing of the national anthem, which at that time was <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">God Save the Queen</EMPHASIS>. Another camp believed that there should be a prayer, but that camp split into two over whether the prayer should be a silent prayer or a prayer that everybody said. After this had gone on for about three-quarters of an hour, Peter got up and said, `Look, the students of Australia have a compromise to  suggest. We suggest that there should be a prayer, but it should be a silent prayer and, while the silent prayer is on, you can play <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">God Save the Queen</EMPHASIS>.' Naturally, this turned everybody into passionate opponents of the National Union of Australian University Students, but it certainly exposed the pomposity that had gone on. Peter devoted his life to pricking pomposity and cant with that dry humour and wit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not speak about his subsequent career to any great extent because I am sure others will. He went on to become the Chairman of the Public Service Board, a key adviser in the reform of the New South Wales, and not least the Tasmanian, public service. He was the Ambassador to the United Nations where he established the Wilenski Group, which set about to reform that Augean stable of an institution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Peter became the Secretary to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I joined that department in 1966 and he joined it in 1967. I remember him remarking to me at that time that he did not believe that a Jewish refugee whose name ended in `s-k-i' would ever get far in such an Anglo-Celtic institution, as it was then. In the end, he became the secretary to that department. It is a matter of the most extraordinary sadness that his illness prevented him from running it and changing it in a way that would make it ever more relevant. That is not to suggest that I do not think that has not happened already. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was a Sydney person first, last and always. He was elected on his sick bed with a record vote to the Sydney University Senate, something that gave him great pleasure, just as his elevation to be a Companion of the Order of Australia gave him great pleasure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one thing at which he was not successful was acting. I remember he was in Adelaide at a time when the Adelaide University's Footlights Club put on a very expensive production of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hamlet</EMPHASIS>, with which I was associated. The entire cast managed to get the flu on the night before opening night, so we had people reading parts. Dr Wilenski, who was staying with me at that time, was obliged to be a soldier to come on carrying a spear. He did that badly. I recall that one of his duties was to come on at the death of Hamlet and be one of those people who carried Hamlet off. If ever there were an epitaph that I would like to read into the parliamentary records, it is the lines that Horatio speaks on the death of Hamlet:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise&mdash;in a very small way, amongst other things&mdash;to echo the comments of the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney). The obvious sincerity of his comments about Peter Wilenski reflects great credit on both of them. I knew Peter Wilenski extremely slightly when we both served on the university Senate&mdash;he in an august position; I as a mere student representative. I have to say that, while I did not always agree with him&mdash;in fact I nearly always disagreed with him&mdash;his contributions were remarkable for their intellect and for their verve. Obviously, Australia has lost a very significant human being with his passing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, I wish to pay tribute to a predecessor of mine as member for Warringah, Mr Ted St John, who held the seat between 1966 and 1969. In a short but remarkable career he made quite an impact on public life. There were two issues which, I guess, live at this distance. The first was his championing of the cause of the victims of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> disaster. He believed that an injustice had been done to those people. He proclaimed that injustice loudly, and for proclaiming that injustice he was widely reviled. Yet, in the end, injustice it turned out to have been. Ted St John deserves the gratitude of all those people, but really he deserves the gratitude of all Australians because the ultimate function of this place is to ensure, in so far as we are able, that justice is done to all our fellow Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was another matter for which he entered the headlines and that was in respect of the standards of personal behaviour of the then Prime Minister. While by today's lights his strictures seem somewhat puritanical, by the same token it is very important that we maintain the highest standards of decorum in the highest offices of the land. It is as relevant today as it was then that we have the very best possible behaviour from our Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On leaving public life he did not lose interest in public affairs. In 1975 and 1976 he engaged in lively public debate on certain constitutional events that took place on 11 November 1975. He maintained an interest in public affairs up to the last months of his life. I recall reading in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Manly Daily</EMPHASIS> a letter from Ted St John in which, amongst other things, he remarked on the importance of remedying an act of great environmental vandalism, that is, draining Lake Pedder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was a maverick. He was a noteworthy maverick. We cannot have too many mavericks in public life, but we certainly need a few.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this condolence debate to honour Peter Wilenski. It is very unusual for the House to have condolence motions for public servants, but both Peter Wilenski and Sir Geoffrey Yeend were public servants of outstanding quality. Peter Wilenski was a particularly outstanding public-spirited Australian. He worked with dedication and determination for the common good. No higher praise can be given to anyone in public life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the outstanding things about Peter was his capacity to move between sectors. A number of people have remarked on that fact. It is worth noting again that he began in medicine, he was active in student politics&mdash;this is where I, like the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney), first knew of him&mdash;he was a fine scholar, he was an absolutely outstanding public servant, he made a very major mark in international relations and, if circumstances had been different, he would have been a member of this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was a polymath, a renaissance man. He was a natural intellectual. He was thoughtful, creative, original, and one of the few people whom one could continually read with and learn new insights. Some of his contributions have been mentioned by others, but one of those that has not been mentioned was his contribution to the Coombs Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration which was perhaps the most comprehensive and rigorous study of the Australian Public Service that has ever been made. He was an outstandingly fine professional public administrator&mdash;a calling which does not receive the same affirmation now as it once used to. It is important to reassert its importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was impressive to hear praise from members of the opposition earlier. That indicates that, while having strong commitments, he was also perceived as having the capacity to be a dispassionate public administrator. He was the only Companion of the Order of Australia that I know of who received the award for work for social justice. I think that demonstrates that the people who nominated him understood well the contribution he made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His national contributions in employment whilst chair of the Public Service Commission were tremendous. One notable point that has been made and which is worth emphasising again was his commitment to gender equity. This was a very important contribution. One contribution he made to international relations which has not been mentioned is that he was one of the founders of the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau. He did some of the original work in 1974 and 1975 when AIDAB was being set up. He was also behind the establishment of the National Centre for Development Studies at the ANU. The minister who just spoke knows well that contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was reading a report yesterday on the need to reform the United Nations. An important part of that report was quotations from a report of a committee that Peter Wilenski chaired whilst Australian ambassador to the United Nations. He is remembered at the United Nations as a major innovator and for the quality of his work. He was highly regarded there and by his own department. When talking recently about an issue with members of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, they said, `We should ask Peter about that.' Even knowing how sick he was, they were still seeking his advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was a very cultured man. He may not have been able to act, but he had a fine and deep appreciation of the arts. One of my memories of him was going with him in New York one afternoon to see a marvellous exhibition of Velazquez at the Metropolitan and of Edward Hopper at the Guggenheim. He was a very warm man, shy in some ways, but he had a great range of friends. I think some of these condolence speeches demonstrate that well. He was a man of great dignity. The dignity and courage he showed during his terrible and long sickness is a clear indication of that. I join with others in sending my wholehearted sympathy to Jill and their children. I conclude by saying that his inspiration will live on in those who knew and admired him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to say a few words about Ted St John and then a few more words about Peter Wilenski. I came to know Ted St John in the 1960s because he was very interested in a number of causes that I was involved in. He was very concerned about the question of civil liberties and censorship. He was also very concerned about the death penalty and was a strong campaigner in the Liberal Party for its abolition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As was quite correctly said by the present honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), Ted St John was a maverick in this House. He inflicted very great harm on John Gorton, the then Prime Minister. Temperamentally, they were so dramatically different. There was a puritanical streak in Ted St John which made it very difficult for him to understand what made John Gorton tick. I was surprised by a newspaper comment at the end of the week that said that virtually no politician had attended his funeral service. If I had been in Australia last week, I certainly would have attended. I had a high regard for his tremendous integrity. He was one Liberal, like Malcolm Fraser, who first took up the whole question of South Africa and the appalling abuse of human rights there. He was involved in that from the 1960s. He was president of the Australian section of the International Commission of Jurists from 1961 to 1973. He was a remarkable man, a frequent correspondent of mine with a fierce independence of mind in a variety of areas. I think the parliament misses that; we ought to have more people of his quality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should, in passing, make reference to Sir Geoffrey Yeend who, again, was a very distinguished public servant and made a large contribution to this nation&mdash;not just as the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet but also because of his interest in education. He became the chancellor of the Australian National University. He had not been involved in that for very long before he had to give it up because of his ill health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say something about Peter Wilenski that other members have not mentioned. Last Friday in Paris, UNESCO's executive board heard a tribute from the Director-General and a response from Australia's ambassador to France and to UNESCO, Alan Brown, followed by a minute's silence. The fact that an international tribunal with 51 people from around the world wanted to pay tribute to this Australian public servant demonstrated very dramatically that he was a genuine international figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">UNESCO was very much concerned because Peter Wilenski was chairman of the panel of international advisers on the reform of its structure. Although he was busily involved in other things as ambassador to the United Nations, he nevertheless flung himself with his customary energy and intellectual penetration into changing the whole nature of UNESCO's secretariat. It is a good illustration of his capacity to tackle complex problems and to find solutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His extraordinary record is illustrated by his having been the only person to have headed four distinct Commonwealth departments&mdash;Education, the Public Service Board, Transport and Communications, Foreign Affairs and Trade. I think that is an unprecedented record. We should consider not only his role in the Coombs report, as the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) pointed out but also, talking about Augean stables, his extraordinary transformation of the government of New South Wales when he did the report for Neville Wran. It would be fair to say&mdash;and I am sure the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) would agree&mdash;that whatever reforms were achieved by Nick Greiner were very much based on the reforms initiated by Peter Wilenski. </PARA>

We were very close friends for a period of three years. He was indeed an independent person. He was once accused at a Liberal Party meeting of being too independent to be a party member, and I think that describes Ted St John to me. He was a man of real conviction. He was not scared by anybody in a senior position.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He had a lot of tragedy in his personal life. He had three disabled children, which is more than most people have to face. He faced that, particularly with his second wife, Val, with great courage and great strength. It did not affect his professionalism at all. He was able to do it all.

I apologise to Val and his sons now for not having been there. He did not last as long in politics as he should have done. That is strange coming from me. Ted St John applied himself very strongly. He entered politics late in life and he stayed a brief while. He is going to be remembered, sadly, for his involvement in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> incident.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;A fortnight ago the House had a second reading debate on the provisions relating to this particular bill and, in response, I just want to make a couple of brief remarks in summing up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset I particularly thank the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) who contributed constructively to the debate and, as a member of parliament, outlined, I think, very reasonable and legitimate concerns relating to this particular establishment. The concerns on which he indicated he had made concerted representations to the government over time related to staff and the ongoing operation of the facility and, in particular, a concern to ensure that the needs of staff for the future were properly taken account of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I indicate, as I did in my second reading speech, that the government has been very conscious of the concerns that were felt in the Geelong area about the timing of the proposal and, indeed, about the sale process in itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am confident the arrangements that have been outlined following those extensive consultations will ensure that the Geelong community and all those associated with ASTA are well served in the new arrangements. It has been made clear, indeed, in terms of the facility's operations in recent times, notwithstanding the difficult economic conditions and state of the industry that has been experienced over the last few years, that the board has made significant strides forward. We would be confident that, with the sale process proceeding, we would be in a position to ensure this important industry is able to be carried forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just make a couple of other comments in relation to the contribution of the member for Ryan (Mr Moore). What has happened here, I think, is a good illustration of the way you can go about examining each of the business enterprises the government has in the different industries, trying to ensure that they are placed, in the first place, on proper commercial terms prior to any sale process proceeding, and then ensuring certainty and clarity about that process from that time onwards. That, exactly, has been the approach the government has followed in relation to ASTA. I think the net result will be a good one for the Australian taxpayers, first of all, the Australian people; and I think it can be positive for this industry as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel very confident the measures that have been outlined and adopted in relation to the rights of employees, both now and in the future organisation, can be well served.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill continues the major reform of Australia's income support system for unemployed people arising from the government's white paper, Working Nation. The measures provide increased incentives under the income test for unemployed people to take up low paid work. They also include the introduction of parenting allowance. The bill also continues the strategy of phasing out payments based on a dependent relationship between people in the social security system, with individuals needing to establish a personal entitlement to a social security payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1 July 1995 there will be an important new non-activity tested, independent payment for families. This new payment, to be known as parenting allowance, will be available to the partners of income support recipients who have dependent children under 16. It will also be available to the partners of low income earners, and to partners who have low personal income who have dependent children under 16. It will incorporate and go beyond the home child-care allowance currently being paid to Australian families. It will, however, preserve the major elements of the home child-care allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The maximum rate of parenting allowance will be the same as the rate paid to each member of a pensioner or allowance couple&mdash;currently $268.20 a fortnight. Generally, parenting allowance will be income and assets tested. Income of both members of a couple will be taken into account. However, as home child-care allowance will be merged into parenting allowance, an amount of parenting allowance of up to $61 a fortnight, a basic parenting allowance component, will be available regardless of income received by the recipient's partner. The amount of up to $61 represents an estimated maximum rate of the home child-care allowance that will apply from 1 January 1995. This amount may be reduced only by personal income of a parenting allowance recipient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the maximum parenting allowance rate, $268.20 a fortnight, and the maximum rate of basic component, $61 a fortnight, will be indexed twice a year in March and September. Although parenting allowance will generally be taxable, any amount paid up to $61 a fortnight will be free of tax. Generally, only people receiving parenting allowance at a higher rate than the $61 basic parenting allowance component will automatically be entitled to additional family payment and health care card concessions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parenting allowance has been carefully designed to improve full-time work incentives for unemployed couples with children. It will also make sure that low income couples with children will continue to be financially better off with one partner in full-time work rather than both being on income support. A further feature of the new allowance is that low income families will have a greater degree of choice about whether one partner will stay at home and care for their children, a choice generally available up to now only to those on higher incomes. At the same time, the entitlement of most higher income families to the basic parenting allowance component that was formerly home child-care allowance will be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Around 260,000 families will receive more than $61 a fortnight. Overall, some 117,000 families are expected to gain around $59 a week from parenting allowance. Announced and introduced into parliament in the International Year of the Family, the parenting allowance initiative will give the partner caring for the children an independent source of income, recognising financially the valuable work of the carer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill makes strategic changes to the income test for unemployed people to make sure that they will always be financially better off by increasing their work earnings. Under the current arrangements, every dollar of income earned above a modest amount causes the loss of a dollar of income support. This seriously diminishes the incentives for people to increase their earnings since they will generally be no better off overall unless the increase in their income is so substantial that they have no further need for income support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1 July 1995, all unemployed people will be able to earn $60 a fortnight before losing any income support. They will lose 50c for each dollar of extra income between $60 and $140 a fortnight, and 70c for each dollar beyond that point. The new rule will apply to single unemployed persons and to couples unless one member of the couple is a pensioner. The new rule will generally replace the joint income test that has tended to discourage both partners from seeking work. The income of one member of a couple will start to affect the other partner's allowance only when the first partner loses entitlement to a social security benefit altogether. Based on current rates, the first partner will be able to earn $466 a fortnight before the other partner's payment will start to reduce. The reduction will then be 70c for each dollar of earnings. The existing joint income rules will continue to apply where one member of a couple is a pensioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill continues the elimination of social security payments based on dependence on another person that started with the withdrawal of the partner add-on rate component earlier this year. Payments are being redirected to individuals based on need in their own right. This bill also recognises the desirability for equity between social security clients, some of whom have to undertake activity testing to qualify for income support and some of whom do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wife pension is currently available to a woman whose partner is receiving either age or disability support pension, disability wage supplement or rehabilitation allowance in certain circumstances. Mature age partner allowance is available to the partner of a mature age allowance recipient. Special needs wife pension is paid to a woman whose partner is receiving either special needs age or special needs disability support pension. All three payments are available without activity testing. There will be no new grants of any of these payments on or after 1 July 1995. However, people who claim and qualify for one of the payments on or before 30 June 1995 will have their entitlement `saved'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most people affected by this proposal will qualify for another form of income support. Those with dependent children under 16 may claim the new parenting allowance. The full range of principal income support payments such as jobsearch allowance or the various pensions will be available. Carer pension may be paid to those caring for an aged or disabled person. Partners aged 40 or more without recent labour force experience may claim the non-activity tested partner allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Partner allowance itself is being refined in line with other changes made by this bill. People currently on partner allowance who have dependent children under 16 are expected to move to the new parenting allowance. Partner allowance will continue to be available to the partners of recipients of jobsearch, newstart or sickness allowance or special benefit. It will also become available to the partners of recipients of age or disability support pension, rehabilitation or mature age allowance or disability wage supplement. However, it will be restricted to partners who are aged 40 or more with no recent work force experience and no dependent children under 16. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Current clients who do not fall into this category will need to claim income support in their own right, with most expected to move to jobsearch allowance. If the client has been registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service, CES, for the 12 months prior to 1 July 1995, newstart allowance will be available. Clients at risk of long-term unemployment will be taken to have the same history of CES registration as their jobsearch or newstart allowance partners so that they will have access to the same programs and job compacts as their partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also provides that a parenting allowance and a partner allowance will generally remain payable to a qualified person even if the person's partner is subject to a non-payment period and even if the partner's payment ceases, subject to meeting the income and assets tests. In a further amendment, parenting and partner allowance recipients will be entitled to health care cards in their own right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A new widow allowance is being introduced by this bill. Since July 1987, there have been no new grants of widow B pension to women under age 50 at that date or to those under age 45 if they had previously been sole parent pensioners. This has been part of a strategy to remove from the social security program gender specific and non-activity tested payments for people of work force age. Many women who would have qualified for widow B pension previously have moved onto other payments such as jobsearch allowance and have had to undertake the usual jobsearch activities to be able to get income support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, many of these women grew up in an era when it was not expected that they would ever work outside the home after marriage and have no recent work force experience with which to confront the harsh realities of the job market. The new widow allowance is being introduced to ease the transition between the current provisions and the eventual phase out of the types of payment mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1 January 1995, widow allowance will be available to women who are widowed, divorced or separated who become so after turning 50 and who have no recent work force experience. The new allowance will be paid at the same rate and under the same income and assets tests as jobsearch and newstart allowances, but it will not be activity tested. Widow allowance will carry an entitlement to a health care card. Women receiving another payment immediately before 1 January 1995 may transfer to widow allowance without having to satisfy the recent work force experience requirement. Women who have turned 60 and who have been beneficiaries for 12 months or more will be entitled to a pensioner concession card. There will be no new grants of widow allowance on or after 1 July 2005, except to women born before 1 July 1955. To avoid confusion, the current widowed person allowance will now be called bereavement allowance but will not otherwise be changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other measures in this bill relate to advance pharmaceutical allowance and education entry payment. Advance pharmaceutical allowance was introduced in 1990, originally to operate until the end of 1991. The success of the scheme has resulted in its extension year by year. It is now to be extended indefinitely by the removal by this bill of the sunset clause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Education entry payment is currently available to recipients of certain social security payments to ease the costs associated with taking up study which may in turn improve the person's chances of finding work. The $200 payment is now being extended to recipients of partner allowance, wife pension and mature age partner allowance, and to recipients of the new parenting and widow allowances. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the opposition, I will address my comments to the Social Security (Parenting Allowance and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. I am glad, in a sense, that the new procedures allow us to follow the second reading speech because we can pick up, I think with a greater sense of clarity, the issues that are involved. The issues are not always simple. This legislation runs to 169 pages; the explanatory memorandum 137 pages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I listened to the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio), I tried to follows those matters about which I have been briefed comprehensively, and I looked around at the gallery to see whether there were any nodding heads. I looked at the advisers and noted that they were very carefully following the parliamentary secretary's every word. I thought it may make it easier for them to understand what they were actually doing. I looked at the clerks&mdash;I am always glad to look at the clerks because I find they have a great deal to occupy them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To listen to these matters, as some people would be for the first time as they heard the parliamentary secretary, one could be forgiven for asking what it is we are doing to our Social Security Act with the myriad of new allowances paid on a whole range of different conditions and criteria which require explanation of the sort that we heard here tonight. I understand this bill is to give legislative effect to measures that were first announced in the budget this year and also in the white paper on employment and growth. The explanatory memorandum says it is also to give effect to one non-budget measure. There was apparently a mistake in the sense that the government, by oversight, had forgotten to include it in some earlier legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I foreshadow that I will be moving an amendment to put certain matters clearly at issue. It is more important to try to get an overview of what the legislation is about and how effectively it is going to achieve its objectives and to use some of the material from those who are in a position to analyse these matters to better understand what is happening. It is my intention to move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for:</PARA>

<PARA>I note that this is the government's major reform bill in this area. In other words, it is the bill that implements its policy to deal with issues that are relevant to the people who are on the lowest income support levels in our community. It is to put in place the regime that will address those sorts of problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting today that we heard a number of questions about the recent ACOSS inquiry and particularly about the poverty and inequality paper prepared by Professor Ann Harding of the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling at the University of Canberra. Professor Harding went behind all the rhetoric that is involved in this matter and made it clear, laid it out, what the government is achieving through this myriad of name changes and alterations of conditions upon which benefits are paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What she made clear, and what we all ought to understand, is that those people in our community who are worst off are not seeing their position improve under this government; they are seeing it worsen in comparison to the most wealthy. I think the government ought to be sensitive to this matter. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) indicated enormous sensitivity to this matter. He challenged the data. He challenged the way in which information is dealt with. He challenged the Henderson poverty line. He argued that there may be ways of explaining this away. Even Professor Harding in her own paper acknowledged that poverty is a very difficult matter to address and that the estimates may have some variations, but the major trends are nevertheless sound. I can understand why the government is sensitive, but Professor Harding had this to say, and I refer to page 3 of her paper:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sole parents continue to be the group most likely to be in poverty, although they are now closely followed by non-elderly single people. About one in every five sole parents or younger singles are in poverty. Couples with children are the third most `at-risk' group, with 12 per cent being below the HPL. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is notwithstanding all of the changes that have been introduced. I suspect that, notwithstanding the cashing out of benefits again and renaming them, which is essentially what we are involved in in this legislation, Professor Harding will be able to produce another paper in 12 months time which will reveal that the circumstances have not changed. Professor Harding went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The risk of being in poverty rises with the number of children in the family (Table 2). For married couples, poverty rates for those with one to three children are reasonably similar, at 10-11 per cent (Figure 2). Only for large families with four or more children does the risk rise sharply, to 22 per cent. For sole parents, the likelihood of being in poverty increases steadily with the number of children, from 17 per cent for those with one child to 31 per cent for those with three or more children.</PARA>
<PARA>She went to deal with each of those groups&mdash;couples with children in poverty, sole parents in poverty, younger single people in poverty, to the inequality estimates. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After ranking all Australians by the equivalent income of their family, and then dividing them into 10 equally sized groups called `deciles', it is possible to estimate the share of total income received by each group. The top 10 per cent of the population received an estimated 26.5 per cent of total equivalent income in September 1994 (ie. after adjusting income for the different needs of different types of families, using the Henderson equivalence scale). As Figure 6 shows, the bottom 10 per cent received a 1.5 per cent share of total income. The richest 30 per cent of Australians received more than half of total income, while the poorest 30 per cent received a 10 per cent slice of the income cake.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is possible to calculate the average needs-adjusted income received by each decile group. The poorest 10 per cent of Australians received an equivalent income of $85 a week, while the richest 10 per cent received an equivalent income of $1500 a week. In other words, the top 10 per cent received almost 18 times as much as the bottom 10 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>It is not me saying that; it is Professor Harding whom the government pays to undertake original research of this type. That makes it abundantly clear that notwithstanding all of the changes, all of the rhetoric, not only have things not got better; they have got worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings us to the changes that are involved in this legislation. The bill introduces a number of new measures, some of which are interrelated and some of which are consequential on other elements of the bill. Amendments to the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act, the Income Tax Assessment Act, the National Health Act and the Veterans Entitlements Act are purely consequential and the coalition will not be opposing them. That brings me to the issue of the parenting allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parenting allowance is one of the major components of this legislation and the government plans to introduce it on 1 July next year. Despite the rhetoric, it is not a new payment. It is a replacement for other social security payments, including the home child-care allowance, which the government introduced on 29 September 1994, and the wife pension, which this legislation will also abolish. The government's explanations for introducing a parent allowance is essentially that it is cashing out other benefits and paying it in the form of a new allowance. There will not be a substantial amount of new money involved in the payment of this. We have to ask ourselves whether this is a good idea. It might be good to use more politically correct language to describe an allowance. It is dreadful to have something called a wife pension; it is better to call it a parent allowance. But what often happens when we change benefits and the titles by which they are known is that we have a whole lot of unforeseen consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One consequence I recently learnt about, and which I have emphasised in this parliament on one or two occasions before, is the extent to which assurances of support, which are given on behalf of new arrivals by relatives who are here, are often found to be ineffective because the form of benefit for which the assurance was given had a name change. Therefore, if you promise to pay any unemployment benefits&mdash;now called a jobsearch or newstart allowance&mdash;the person is able to walk away from the agreement. That is pretty clever politics in using taxpayers' funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is perhaps indicative of this government's legislative performance that it has introduced this legislation to effectively subsume the home child-care allowance into another payment before the legislation to fully implement the home child-care allowance has been passed through the parliament. We are not even up to that yet. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3), which we debated when we were last here, seeks to abolish the with-child dependent spouse rebate&mdash;the payment which the home child-care allowance is replacing. The home child-care allowance is still in the Senate awaiting resolution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the government's current refusal to support opposition and Democrat amendments&mdash;it seems to find them difficult to understand or suggests that they will be difficult to administer&mdash;which would ensure that persons who currently receive the with-child dependent spouse rebate and do not qualify for the home child-care allowance will continue to get support&mdash;one would not have thought that that would not be unreasonable in relation to children&mdash;it is quite possible this bill will pass through the parliament before the taxation changes do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parenting allowance will be an income and assets tested payment payable to partnered persons who have dependent children under the age of 16 years. It will be subject to a new income test for allowees. That will also be introduced in this bill. I will comment on that later. The parenting allowance will doubtless continue the farce which has resulted since the introduction of the home child-care allowance. I will not go through all my press releases in relation to these matters but I will outline some of the issues that have arisen. Currently, due to the government's inability to get legislation through the parliament in a timely fashion, the home child-care allowance, which came into existence on 29 September, is now being paid, but the payment it is meant to abolish has not yet been abolished. That is pretty smart politics on the government's part. One wonders why, when the government introduced legislation that could deal with these matters contemporaneously, it was not able to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The home child-care allowance was introduced to the Australian people as a new $30 a week payment. The Prime Minister was up here today in question time railing on the government's record in relation to poverty and telling us that there was this new home child-care allowance, $30 a week in people's pockets, but the reality is that once we cash out the dependent spouse rebate families will receive only $2.65 extra a week. Is it any wonder that the payment has not addressed the issue of poverty?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Social Security has a computer system which has been beset by problems following the introduction of this new allowance. The system has been unable to cope with the vast amount of information required to be processed. That has had quite significant consequences so far as other beneficiaries are concerned. It has caused payments to be delayed. It has meant that, at times, departmental staff had little or no access to departmental files or other computer records. The government thought it was pretty smart. It introduced a new allowance but the computer system went down&mdash;the unemployed could not get their cheques and others could not get cash payments because the computer was down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of this has to be seen in the context of a government anxious to make changes. The introduction of the parenting allowance, combined with the other changes to this bill, will in my judgment cause problems of the same nature. I would like to know whether the parliamentary secretary is prepared to put her name on the line and give us an assurance that the computer will not break down when they have to feed in the new information. I would like to know whether she is prepared to put her reputation on the line in relation to these new changes and have me come back to this matter at a later date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, unemployed couples cannot get the home child-care allowance. They are some of the worst off people in terms of the poverty line. This is despite the government's rhetoric that the new payment was to benefit low income families. The situation arises where couples, or both partners in a relationship, are unemployed, have a reasonable expectation that they or their partner will be able to get this new benefit. But, no, what has the government done? Because the new home child-care allowance is means tested on the carer's income, it has set an income limit of $250 per fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of the partner allowance on 20 September, which was not an additional payment but was the splitting of the income that the unemployed partners now receive, meant that the carer was now assessed as having an income of approximately $265 per week, making them ineligible for this new payment. In the time that I have been shadow spokesman for social security, I have had more complaints from the partner/spouse in an unemployed couple about this issue than almost any other social security issue. ACOSS has raised the concern&mdash;and quite legitimately&mdash;that where both partners are not able to get into the work force they are also not able to benefit from the home child-care allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure there is a rationalisation. The benefit that was being cashed out did not provide for it. This is the government that is supposed to be addressing the problem of poverty. The government had different commencement dates for the home child-care allowance and the partner allowance. That meant that some people were told they were going to receive this benefit. A letter came out one week saying that they have the benefit&mdash;they had won lotto&mdash;and the next week they get a letter saying, `Terribly sorry; you are getting the partner allowance and you will no longer be eligible.' That is great politics. I can see the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) nodding. He must have had a few complaints in his electorate as well. The fact is that the government could not coordinate it in such a way as to ensure that people were not put in that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will not be opposing the introduction of the parenting allowance, as it is a payment which will provide some additional support to certain low income families&mdash;people who were previously denied access to the home child-care allowance. But I wish to emphasise that, despite the government's claims, it is not a new payment of $132.65 a week. It is just like HCCA&mdash;it was not a new payment but in fact the cashing out of the dependent spouse rebate. Some low income families will receive an additional payment as a result of this change, but relatively few will be eligible to receive the maximum rate of parenting allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the amendments on income tests for jobsearch, newstart, sickness, partner and widow's allowances, this measure will introduce a new taper for the income tests for these allowees. It will remove the earnings disregard&mdash;a very clear statement of policy if you are unfamiliar with these matters&mdash;and abolish the joint income test for benefit couples. The government has stated that these amendments are part of a package of measures to encourage unemployed persons to obtain work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently the income test for unemployed people should mean that for every dollar of income earned over the income threshold, including the earnings disregard, $1 of income support is lost. The new taper will provide a standard $60 a fortnight taper-free area, a 50 per cent taper between $60 and $140 and a 70 per cent taper for any income over $140. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will not be opposing these amendments. However, it needs to be understood that the only unemployed people who will benefit from these changes are those who have been able to find substantial full-time or part-time work. In fact, a large number of unemployed persons, those who have been unable to find extra work, will have their incomes savaged because of the new taper system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not so long ago I put out a detailed paper identifying who some of those people would be. Homeless persons on jobsearch and newstart aged under 18 with an earned income of between $40 and $110 a week will be worse off. Single persons between 18 and 20 years on jobsearch and newstart not living at home with an earned income of between $40 and $110 a week will be worse off. Single people aged 18 to 20 on jobsearch and newstart living at home with an earned income of between $40 and $110 will be worse off. Single persons aged 21 and over on jobsearch and newstart with earned income of between $40 and $110 a week will be in the same position&mdash;worse off. Couples with no children on jobsearch and newstart in which one partner has earned income of between $40 and $150 a week will be in the same position, as are couples with no children on jobsearch and newstart. I produced detailed tables outlining the impact. So, again, the people on the lowest income are going to be put in a worse position. Sure, the bill addresses one of the poverty traps, but we had to lower the standard of living of some of the poorest in order to address the poverty trap. That is the outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments will substantially alter the qualifications for the partner allowance. Currently the partner allowance is payable only to partners of jobsearch allowance, newstart allowance, sickness allowance and special benefits recipients. The bill will modify the partner allowance to provide that partner allowance is payable to persons who have an age pension, disability wage supplement, a disability support pension, mature age allowance pension partner or a partner in receipt of a rehabilitation allowance. This is a consequence of abolishing the wife pension and the mature age partner allowance. It is not because we are paying new benefits; they get a new name. It is not additional income; it is abolishing other payments and, in a sense, cashing out the benefit into a new form of payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will restrict the partner allowance to recipients with little or no recent work force experience who are over 40 years of age, without dependent children under the age of 16 years. All persons who are over 40 and without dependent children under 16 will remain on partner allowance regardless of recent work force experience. All persons who have children under 16 may be qualified for a parenting allowance. The bill will provide that persons who no longer qualify for a partner allowance after 1 July will be granted  access to newstart programs if they are at risk of long-term unemployment. It will be based on their partner's unemployment  duration. It will provide that the partner allowance is payable to a person where a jobsearch or newstart allowance non-payment period has been imposed on the person's partner and subject to the income and assets test provided that a person can remain qualified for a partner allowance after the person's partner ceases to receive a social security payment or pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes will mean that a younger woman who is the partner of a social security recipient and who does not have children will have to qualify for income support in her own right. Younger women who have children and who currently receive the partner allowance will now have to transfer over to a parenting allowance. The partner allowance was only introduced in September this year and already the government is making substantial changes to it, which is typical of the government's piecemeal approach to social security issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst not opposing this measure, the opposition is concerned about the confusion the government will generate by making these changes. There still exists considerable confusion in the community resulting from the introduction of the home child-care allowance and the partner allowance and the proposed abolition of the with-child dependent spouse rebate. The further changes to the partner allowance and parenting allowance amendments will only exacerbate this problem. The government appears to be going out of its way to ensure that the welfare system in Australia is as complex and as user-unfriendly as is possible. If this indeed is its objective, then the government has gone a long way to achieving its goal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is also introducing legislation through this bill which phases out the wife pension, and mature age partner allowance. The wife pension is currently available to a woman whose partner is receiving the age pension, disability support pension, disability wage supplement or, in certain circumstances, the rehabilitation allowance. The mature age partner allowance is available to a person whose partner is receiving the mature age allowance. The special needs wife pension is available to a woman who has a partner who is receiving the special needs allowance or special needs disability support pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be no new grants of any of these payments after 1 July. However, women who qualify in claiming these payments before June 1995 will have their entitlements `saved'. Wives of people granted a pension after 1 July 1995 or partners of allowance recipients will now be forced to apply for parental allowance, jobsearch allowance, disability support or carer pension depending on their circumstances. The measure will affect approximately 137,652 women over the next three years. I admire the government's estimating skills. The coalition will not oppose this measure. We are not opposing the education entry payment. The sunset clause relating to the advance pharmaceutical allowance is repealed. Those amendments which repeal the sunset clause and allow for the advance pharmaceutical allowance to continue on an indefinite basis are not opposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by discussing the changes relating to the introduction of the widow allowance and the renaming of the widowed person's allowance. The widow allowance was announced by the government less than one month ago, after the release of the white paper and three weeks after the 1994 budget. The introduction of this allowance is an attempt to rectify a major policy deficiency that became very clear with a number of public campaigns that were being waged on this matter, that is, politics which relate to older single women with limited employment experience. Contrary to the government's claims, it was the coalition that first raised this anomaly after the release of the white paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1987, when the government decided to phase out the widow B pension over a 15-year program, Labor's policies have discriminated against single older women. The white paper changes further extended this discrimination against older women who were either divorced, separated or widowed. When the abolition of the widow B pension was debated in the House of Representatives in 1987, James Porter, who was then my predecessor, outlined our concern on this measure:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Again the government is acting against the woman who marries young, raises her children and stays at home to care for those children. Once the mother reaches the age of 50 to 55 and has little or no income, the children have grown older and the husband has died, the government says that she should not receive a pension. She is expected to go back into the work force and, of course, she will have few skills to enable her to go back into the work force and, if she does not, she will have to go on the dole.</PARA>
<PARA>The widow allowance is not a new initiative; it is just a poor imitation of the widow B pension. If the government had really intended to remedy the matter and put those women back in the same position they would have been in as widows, it could have extended the widow B pension. But the government made changes to it to effect budgetary savings. The widow allowance is paid at lower rates than the widow B pension. I took out a comparison upon which they were paid. If you were receiving a widow B pension fortnightly, when I prepared this table it was $318.10 per fortnight. If you receive the widow allowance and you have no children, it is $294.10. It is the same rate if you have children. The income tests are different. For the full rate it is up to $90, if you have no children. It is up to $114 if you have one child and you add $24 for every extra child. But, if you are getting a widow allowance, the income test is up to $60. Part rate changes are similar. The assets test is similar in relation to full rate beneficiaries but in relation to those who are on the part rate it is imposed on a different basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not opposing the changes, but it ought to be clearly understood that the government, in addressing this matter by paying an allowance, is not remedying the fundamental problem but ensuring that those people do not receive any additional payments as a result of their circumstances.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that when the opposition spokesperson on social security matters rails against us for being a government daring to spend an extra $350 million a year supporting families in this country, when he says how dreadful the way we are doing that is, he never in fact uses the opportunity that a good, effective opposition member would to say what the opposition would do if it were in power? Did anybody actually hear one word from the opposition spokesperson on social security about what his party would do? No. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio) is shaking her head, and well she should because she sat here for half an hour listening to the honourable member for Berowra telling us how bad we are because we dared put in place additional payments, new support payments for families and for unemployed people, new opportunities for them to earn money through part-time employment and therefore increase their effective income. All of these things, we are told, are bad because we are introducing all these new measures, but there was not one word about what the opposition would do. The main reason it cannot is that it has no policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has a few empty words in that little flat book that disappeared without a trace called The Things That Matter. It said very little indeed about social security. We do not really know what it would do but we do know that it would be prepared, and is arguing very forcefully and very strongly, for cuts in government expenditure. The empty rhetoric we heard today was particularly shallow because the opposition was pinned right against the wall in question time by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when he said that the opposition has the gall to get up in this House and talk about how dreadful poverty is, how the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer, yet it is not prepared to actually contrast that with the fact that its members are the ones who want to cut the incomes and the support programs that this government has put in place for the lowest income families in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a consistent part of the opposition's policy platform since it has been in opposition to slash social security expenditure. In its last policy manifesto, Fightback, the opposition intended to slash some $10 billion from social security payments. It would have been the unemployed who would have suffered, the very people whom the honourable member for Berowra was claiming to be so concerned about. It would have been the unemployed, the low income families, the most defenceless groups in our society who would have borne the major brunt of the opposition's slash to social security expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us put the rhetoric aside and look at the performance compared with the rhetoric. This opposition does not have one ounce of concern for the unemployed, not one ounce of credibility for talking about poverty traps in this country, whereas the government, through this legislation, is in fact proposing to aid those very groups by giving an additional $347.2 million in the next financial year to families who are the lowest income earners in this country. That is the contrast between the empty words of the opposition and the performance of the government. We have consistently put in place programs that have boosted the incomes and boosted the earning capacity of the lowest income people in this society, and this legislation will continue with that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Social Security (Parenting Allowance and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 implements a range of important initiatives announced in the federal government's white paper, such as the parenting allowance, and other key initiatives revealed following the publication of the Working Nation document in May. Before outlining some of the main elements of this bill, it is important to place in context Australia's system of income support measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Effectively, our nation's social security arrangements for unemployed people still largely reflect the unemployment benefit system that was introduced by the Labor governments of the 1940s. Australia's labour market has undergone a somewhat radical facelift since that decade from when only the male of a couple was looking for work to today's situation which is witnessing a massive participation in the labour force by women. Naturally, these have not been the only differences. An increase in part-time employment and a decline in full-time jobs, particularly for young Australians, is a trend that was not encountered in the 1940s when it was natural for unemployed people to gain full-time jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further changing characteristic of our labour market has been the very large increase in long-term unemployment&mdash;a factor that did not have to be contended with 50 years ago. It must be pointed out that, as was the case half a century ago, today only a Labor government has the vision, the inspiration and the drive to introduce a broad range of initiatives to support those in our community who have fallen on hard times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many in the opposition, such as the honourable member for Berowra, poured scorn on the Prime Minister when he made his statement, following the success of the election in 1993, that he would not leave the unemployed people of Australia behind. The policies and programs contained in the white paper&mdash;some of which we are debating today&mdash;deliver on that commitment. That is another contrast: we deliver on our commitments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we are debating this legislation, let us not forget these important facts. Only the socially progressive and community responsive programs of Labor governments can deliver a balanced income support system for Australia. The white paper programs which are contained in this bill include, firstly, replacing the 100 per cent taper in the income test for jobsearch, newstart and sickness allowances with a 70 per cent taper. This change, in particular, is a significant incentive to unemployed people, and their partners, to work additional part-time hours. At present, a single unemployed person loses $1 in allowance for each additional income earned between $85 and $214 per week. Importantly, without any doubt, this measure will ensure all unemployed people will gain financially from working additional hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the legislation replaces the joint income test in these allowances for couples with a separate partner income test. The existing disincentive applies to both members of a couple as the present income test operates on a joint family basis, even since the introduction of the partner allowance in September 1994. This current disincentive is highlighted by the fact that wives of unemployed men have a significantly lower labour force participation rate and higher unemployment rate than the wives of employed men. This bill changes this situation by introducing a new partner income test. From 1 July 1995 the payment received by each member of a couple will be unaffected until the partner's payment is exhausted under the income test&mdash;that is, at $233 per week&mdash;and the reduction will then be 70c for each dollar of income. Once again, both members of an unemployed couple will gain financially from working additional hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, this legislation introduces a new parenting allowance available to low income families where one partner receives a social security payment or is in low income employment and the other parent cares for the children. The parenting allowance, which is the crux of this bill, will be introduced on 1 July next year. It will incorporate the recently introduced home child-care allowance and will be payable to partnered persons who have dependent children under the age of 16 years. This process of supplementing incomes of low paid families began with family payment supplements in the 1980s and their integration into a single payment in January 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This had the effect of paying low income families the same amount in family payments, regardless of whether they were unemployed. Despite the existence of family payments, around 2.5 per cent of families still gain no financial benefit from taking a full-time job. The introduction of the parenting allowance will overcome this problem. It will not be subject to an activity test and will be paid at the same rates and subject to the same personal income, partner income and assets test as the jobsearch allowance and newstart allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, all unemployed persons will now gain financially from taking full-time work. An additional $350 million&mdash;or, to be completely accurate, $347.2 million&mdash;will be channelled to low income working families in 1995-96. That will increase to $366.7 million in 1996-97 and $393.3 million in 1997-98. Yet the honourable member for Berowra claims that the parenting allowance will do nothing to assist low income families. It is a significant payment which will have an enormous benefit to those families, and it is something that the opposition should be applauding rather than criticising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a few examples of the exact impact of these three measures on families. The first example is that of a single unemployed person taking up part-time work which pays $200 per week before tax. Under the current system, this person's jobsearch or newstart allowance payment would be reduced to $12 per week, giving a total gross income of $212. When the new system is introduced, this person's total jobsearch or newstart entitlement will be $36 a week, making him $24 a week better off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example is that of an unemployed person with a partner and two dependent children under 13 years of age who receives $200 per week from part-time work. Currently, the family would receive an additional $140 per week jobsearch or newstart married rate allowance and an $86 per week family payment&mdash;a total family income of $426 per week. Under the new income test, the family will receive $22 in jobsearch or newstart allowance, $133 in parenting allowance and $86 in family payments per week&mdash;a total of $441, leaving it $15 per week better off. The family's income will increase further if the partner receiving the parenting allowance obtains some part-time work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A third example is that of a partner from a couple with no dependent children who works full time and gets a gross wage of $342 per week. Under the current income support system, this person's partner is not eligible for income support so the couple's total income is $342 per week. Under the new system, the partner without earnings will receive $55 per week in jobsearch or newstart allowance. The couple's total weekly income will increase to $397 a week and their income will increase further if the second partner obtains some part-time work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of the above examples include rent assistance, which currently provides additional maximum support of between $32.20 and $42.90 per week, depending on the amount of rent paid, marital status and the number of children in a family. Honourable members can see from those examples that the measures in this legislation are going to have a very direct and very beneficial impact on the incomes and living standards of unemployed people. It is very clear that the measures to be put in place from 1 July 1995 will benefit unemployed couples who were not eligible for the home child-care allowance when it was introduced on 29 September this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally, unemployed families will be much better off with this new system. I think they will appreciate these new benefits the government is introducing. Measures other than those in the white paper which are contained in the bill pertain to the changing role of women in Australia's labour market. Over half of all women of work force age now participate in the labour force. On the basis of this statistic, it is no longer appropriate to make payments to women on the basis of an assumption of dependency. In this respect, there will be a phasing out over a significant period of the partner allowance and the gender based wives pension. There will be no new grants of wives pension from 1 July 1995, but existing recipients will be protected. Further, in future years, the partner allowance will be paid only to people aged 40 years or more as at 1 July 1995 with little or no recent work force experience. Existing recipients will transfer to the parenting allowance or jobsearch allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the phasing out of the widows B pension in 1987, the importance of recognising the many older women who have had little or no recent work force experience and have never had an expectation that they would need to rejoin the work force has grown. With this in mind, there will be a widows allowance from 1 January 1995. This payment will be at jobsearch allowance rates; however, it will not have an activity test attached to its payment. It will be available to women over the age of 50 whose widowhood, divorce or separation occurred after they turned 50. It will phase out in line with the partner allowance: that is, it will be available only to women born before 1 July 1945. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, it is important to recognise that the government has responded to community concerns on this question. Members of both the government and the opposition have raised this matter and have sought some redress on the previous legislation introduced in 1987. The government has responded positively to this. I think the government should be congratulated rather than criticised for having responded in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The legislation will have financial impacts on the budget. There are some cost savings in other measures but overall there will be an additional $248 million in 1995-96, rising to $282 million in 1997-98. These amounts reflect the cost of the parenting allowance minus some of the savings in some other measures. It is estimated that 117,000 spouses of low income earners will gain eligibility to the parenting allowance, with an average gain of $59 per week. The integration of the home child-care allowance within the parenting allowance will raise the free area of the parenting allowance income test by an average of $3 to $20 per week. It will also extend the $200 education entry payment to recipients of the wives pension, partner allowance, parenting allowance, widow allowance and mature age partners allowance. That is another important initiative in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than postpone reform in Australia's welfare system, this Labor government has taken up the challenge to update the social security provisions for unemployed people so they are relevant not only for today but for Australia's future. As the Prime Minister said today in question time, the fundamental measurement for poverty in this country revolves around access to employment. An important feature of this bill and the new arrangements it introduces is that unemployed people will be financially better off by getting a full-time job or by working more hours in a part-time job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already, we have witnessed a number of significant improvements in our nation's job growth&mdash;the job figures for September alone show some 75,000 additional full-time places&mdash;and unemployment statistics, despite record levels of labour market participation, are still falling. The initiatives contained in this bill provide income support incentives to improve not only Australia's employment growth but also the quality of life of low income and unemployed Australians. I have much pleasure in commending the bill to the House. </PARA>

With no work experience and a limited education, Peter has been searching long and hard for work. He has managed to obtain a part-time job working as a labourer, which pays him an extra $80 per week.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the scenario. More and more Australian families are finding that they have to supplement their incomes with government allowances. For example, in 1973, 13.5 per cent of Australians over 16 received a government benefit. By 1993&mdash;we can be sure that in 1994 it will be higher&mdash;this number had increased to 33.1 per cent. This has to be an indictment of the Labor government's track record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past 11 years the government has fundamentally failed to solve the unemployment crisis. At least one in five children in Australia today is growing up in a family affected by unemployment. More and more people have to accept part-time work when they would rather be working full time. More and more families are receiving some sort of government payment not because this federal government is generous with taxpayers' money but because this federal government has not given families a chance to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the rhetoric of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) at question time today, there is an increasingly large gap between the rich and poor in Australia. The top 10 per cent of wage earners in Australia have seen their incomes rise by seven per cent since 1983. The bottom 10 per cent of income earners have seen their real wages fall by five per cent. So much for this Labor Party being the champion of the poor. This is a situation which this federal government has created and this is why our Australian families desperately need things such as the home child-care allowance, the parenting allowance and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the government cannot even get its allowances right. The home child-care allowance is still being debated. I have spoken in this House before about the shambles that is the HCCA. Believe it or not, the very people who you would think should benefit from a payment aimed at low income families&mdash;families where both parents are unemployed&mdash;are not eligible for the HCCA. Where is the justice in that? The coalition has been astounded by the absolute injustice of this targeting of the HCCA and is pushing for further amendments. Not surprisingly, considerable public confusion has been created by the introduction of these new allowances for families, particularly with the introduction of the HCCA, the partner allowance and the abolition of the dependent spouse rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that even the staff of the Department of Social Security are having great difficulty coming to terms with the new programs. No doubt it has something to do with the industrial issues that have been part of that department in recent times. The implementation of the programs has been simply a mess&mdash;and this is by a government that has had over 11 years to practise. As I have mentioned, the office of the Department of Social Security recently went on strike demanding extra staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The DSS has been swamped by clients confused about the HCCA and other payments. The parenting allowance will add to the confusion. Under this government, the workload of the DSS has grown because the government has had no answers to our problems. It does not know how to cope with our unemployment. It can only promise more training schemes and computerised job boards at the local CES. People on the jobless queues do not care whether the job boards are computerised. What is the use if there are no jobs on the board anyway?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government cannot promise anything to regional Australia. This is where there seems to be total ignorance within the government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Working Nation, the only thing regional Australia got from the government was a promise to help set up super regional development boards. My electorate already has several development boards, all of which work very well. Apart from that, Working Nation effectively told regional Australia and regional families that we were on our own. It talked vaguely about encouraging local leadership, emphasised that regional bodies should not wait for government funding and made some patronising noises about how regional Australia is best equipped to look after itself after the federal Treasurer (Mr Willis) has dipped into our pockets via increased taxation, particularly with that sneakiest of taxes&mdash;the wholesale sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than offering innovative programs and some positive incentive to the region, Working Nation has let regional Australia down. All the while, this government thinks it can fix things by the introduction of a parenting allowance and other payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Low income families appreciate any extra support they can get. But, if asked what they would really like most, most will reply that they want jobs, particularly for their children and grandchildren and for small country towns and regional cities. Families want the opportunity to work and earn their own money and not have to rely on the government to pay their rent or clothe their children. Families want the opportunity to save for the future. They also want to ensure that that future is a bright one for their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are already seeing second or third generation unemployment in some families. This has to stop. I keep saying&mdash;when I rise in this place I talk mostly about unemployment&mdash;that I was blessed to have grown up at a time of full employment in this country. I cannot look the young in the eye until I see that same level of employment.

It is a great pity that this government is not more aware of the fact that small business makes up 50 per cent of the employment equation.

The winners of the two secondary school categories are here today in the gallery, and I welcome them. I would like to take this opportunity to share with honourable members the thoughts of these young people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first essay was written by Lesley Debono, a year 8 student from Richmond High School. His essay, entitled `Our environment: our future', reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today, one of the most talked about subjects is the environment, when we hear the word "environment", what comes to mind? Pollution, conservation, ecology? Unfortunately, it seems we have built up a negative picture of our environment, our surroundings. Ever since the late 1700's, the beginning of the industrial revolution, we began to harm our planet on a world wide scale. No one at that time realised what devastating damage that things such as factories could do, nor the misery and unhygienic conditions population explosions resulted in. My argument is that we should conserve our environment for our future. Today things are improving, mainly through awareness, but will we have an environment to look forward to in the future?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, we need to look at what exactly our environment is. Basically it is our surroundings. This includes where we live, work and play. It also includes places that are untouched by humans, such as forests and oceans. We need our environment to sustain our basic needs such as food and water but we also use many other resources such as coal and gas. We can therefore conclude that the state of where we live (local environment) reflects our own health and attitudes. However the earth is a very complex system of smaller environments and are all linked one way or another. For example; pollution that originates at factories is usually carried by the wind (or water) to another area, thus affecting an entirely different area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have all heard of the problems with our environment. Air, water and soil pollution being the main forms. Environmental pollution is summed up as, "poisonous or harmful substances which are discharged and affect the environment". Apart from pollution, mining and logging are also harmful activities to the environment. All of these disturbances upset the balance in which nature depends on to keep things stable. If one species of plant goes extinct the animals which used to eat would in turn die out and so on. Another important aspect is health. When water is polluted the fish living in it may absorb the toxic substances and when we or other animals eat the fish we may get sick, so in this example, the chemicals are carried back into our environments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present we know now a lot more about our environment than we used to. Without a healthy environment we will surely suffer the consequences. That is why we must take action now and hopefully find a solution to these problems. Today there are many options we can take to help our environment. Recycling is something just about everyone has heard of and if everyone participated it would make a noticeable impact. Choosing the right products, with little or no potentially harmful materials, such as CFC-free spray cans, would soon get noticed by the manufacturing companies. Writing to politicians and important public figures is necessary because just like anyone else, they aren't mind readers. Awareness is a vital key to make all this work and should continue so that everyone is informed on what is going on and what they can do. Other than this we may hope that a discovery or discoveries will be made in the not-to-distant future and change our lives for the better.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So in summary, our environment is our surroundings. Yet it is connected in a complex web to all other places. We need our environment to survive, for its supplies us with everything. Recently, it has been and continues to be damaged like it never has been. We the people, everyone of us, are responsible for its well being. It must be taken care of and shared by all. We must strive for a balanced and natural environment, not only for the health and well being of ourselves but our children and their descendants for many generations to come.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today I referred to actions by CRA to manipulate changes to industrial legislation to destroy the right of employees to collectively negotiate. The strategies and tactics of CRA are repudiated by most sensible, law-abiding, responsible employer organisations and their individual companies. Sadly, however, the actions of CRA are clouding the achievements of the last decade during which the work force has made considerable sacrifices to ensure our country is more productive and internationally competitive. Workplace reform has been achieved by trust between employer and employee, but the actions of CRA are injecting into workplace reform a nasty capital labour conflict which is totally unnecessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CRA, which according to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly </EMPHASIS>is the seventh most profitable company in the nation, is currently forcing upon workers at Bell Bay in Tasmania, and Weipa in Queensland, individual employment contracts which are unique in the employment history of this country&mdash;unique in the absolute power and discretion they give to the employer vis-a-vis the employee; contracts that give the employee no rights whatsoever; contracts the aims of which are to abolish the award safety net; contracts that will mean in the end that there will be no minimum standards for these workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What CRA is about is deunionising the work force as the first step in crushing the award system. These contracts are absolutely one-sided affairs straight out of the Liberal Party's Jobsback policy of the last election. The workers either agree to the individual contract or their prospects are finished in the company. It is the contract or the door. Of course, CRA does not present its strategy and tactics like this. It has in place a sophisticated Orwellian strategy and tactical response to camouflage from the work force and the broader Australian community its real intent. I call this strategy plan X. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CRA hides its policies behind a screen of secret words like change process, reform, differential rewards, conversion and behavioural change. Behind the jargon, the reality is that Big Brother knows best. It wants a world where all employees have to take what the boss wants to give them&mdash;take it or leave it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chosen instrument for these primitives whose ideal world was the relationship of lord and master in the Middle Ages is the individual contract. It is usually a piece of paper pushed at employees, usually with a short deadline. There is usually a carrot of more money now, but no framework for future increases or review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At Bell Bay it has implemented plan X carefully. It has modelled it on events at its aluminium smelter in New Zealand where it has driven out the unions and forced workers into accepting individual contracts. Only last year a survey of Bell Bay workers paid for by the company showed that 80 to 90 per cent rejected the idea of a contract. In June this year almost all accepted the idea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The work force had been softened up by the one in four redundancies in a drumbeat of propaganda that the plant was under threat. Only signing the contracts, CRA said, could save the plant. CRA created a climate of fear in less than a year to diminish the union's role with the work force to collectively negotiate. The manipulation of fear was what CRA had learnt from its experiences in New Zealand and is now what it is trying to replicate throughout this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Plan X, a secret strategy and its associated tactical manoeuvres, is easily ascertained from evidence in the IRC where unions are challenging the CRA attempts at individual contracts at Bell Bay. It is also evident in a 1992 book co-authored by CRA executives entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The right to choose</EMPHASIS>. The evidence in this book and the evidence from the commission fleshes out plan X. Basically, plan X is a manual on how New Zealand management crushed its work force and how this could be done in Australia to bypass our industrial relations system and to bust open the award system. CRA essentially sets out to create an unreal mythology about its business in an attempt to blackmail the work force into the introduction of individual contracts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In New Zealand, CRA developed and implemented plan X to create myths to undermine the unions in the hearts and minds of workers. It cost it a lot of money, just as the implementation of the plan in Weipa and Bell Bay has cost it a lot of money. Luring workers onto individual contracts with healthy overaward payments is the first step. The company then says, `I'm your friend now. You will not have to waste money on union dues.' The process begins. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the New Zealand smelter, the first part to soften up the workers was to use housekeeping and safety as its initial thrust. It made improvements in safety to demonstrate its caring for the work force and to make it difficult for the union to resist and oppose change. Of course, it should have been in the interests of the workplace in the first place for CRA to promote safety initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next step in New Zealand and here is to make full use of opportunities from the external environment. Essentially what this means is to threaten closure of the plant unless all workers agree to individual contracts and the deunionisation of the plant. Individual contracts are presented as the only alternative if employees want to save their jobs. Here the company is brutally exploiting the desire for job security in the work force. The evidence acknowledges that CRA believes that the ability of management to create a climate of fear is difficult when the plant and the company is profitable. Nevertheless it moves on by creating more myths. It sets out to remove the union completely from the work force. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People will cop a lot of things, including union interference. But these fellows are brawny types; they have a lot of difficulty getting two in the same crane cabin. They are not allowed to have only one in the cabin, notwithstanding that that is what the cabin was designed for. We had the situation where this was supposed to be for the protection of workers. They have a side of lamb as their crib. They drive the train there and back to pick up a load of iron ore. This does nothing for Australia's reputation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that workers concerned have not been bludgeoned into these arrangements. The other day a desperate attempt was made to reach agreement with the people on the oil rigs. They eventually came to an agreement almost over the dead bodies of the trade union bureaucrats. This issue has to be seen for what it is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These workers are not like the people we saw in the British industrial revolution, who were severely exploited. They have had the benefit over many years&mdash;in the case of most of those workers, during Liberal years&mdash;of a good education, and they understand their worth. I have dealt with hundreds of them in the north-west over my lifetime, be they working for the local authority or other organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On one occasion the guys come to me as shire president and said, `We are going 150 miles into the bush to do a job on a piece of road and we would like to finish that job in 10 days and work straight through the weekend. It is not worth coming home for the weekend. Could we then have four days off?' I said that that suited me and I could not see why the council would object to that arrangement. But the union objected. It demanded that, if the fellows worked through, at their request, for that time, they should be paid the penalty rates applicable. So the council said it was not going to pay the penalty rates and that, even though they worked in a large local authority with 1,500 miles of road, they would have to go home for the weekend. The fellows were not very happy about that. They were very put out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most importantly, I have been told time and time again by people throughout the Pilbara that they wanted out not just because of the union fees that were deducted. Every now and then Bill Ludwig or someone else would get a flash of inspiration that the workers had to make a further contribution&mdash;for a purpose totally unrelated to the welfare of workers on that mine site&mdash;and a further $10 or $20 would come out of their pay. It might have been the week when mum was thinking of buying a pair of shoes for the kids. But,  tough, it was gone. Those people have had enough of that. They are not at all put out by all of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At Geraldton Veterans Retirement Home in my own electorate one woman said, `This is the first time in my working life that I have got a roster that suits me.' The union stepped in over the top with the legislation of the government and said, `You cannot have that roster. We are taking over. We know what is best for you. We are going to represent your interests.' We know what they are on about. They want the money. The union bureaucrats are interested in one sort of job security&mdash;theirs. That is what is outrageous about these things. Your typical Australian does not need the help of the Bill Ludwigs of this world. They have demonstrated their ability to negotiate. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

When Bob Dylan wrote this song in 1962, I wonder if he knew that these questions would still be asked thirty-two years later. But today, they're not just questioning human nature and war. They can be interpreted to question our society, and most importantly, our community and environment. It seems that this song is ageless.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Who can say how many seas that white dove will have to sail before she can sleep in the sand? Maybe the question should be `How long will a white dove have to struggle through Sydney's smog to find a beach or river bank safe enough to sleep on?'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In CRA's plan X the work force is essentially seen as something to be manipulated into signing individual contracts. There was never any serious discussion about sharing productivity. Of course, Bell Bay is just a rehearsal for the rest of CRA and Australia. The plot is simple. Con the workers with myths, beat the drum of safety to show a caring face, steel the workers to some external threat to their jobs, create a void in industrial relations in the plan and then stampede the workers into signing a contract. The counsel for the ACTU, Mr Merkel QC, summed it up well in the arbitration commission when he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What emerged on May 25 (Bell Bay) was not an overnight job. It was a long thought out plan to . . . ultimately deunionise the workplace, as occurred in New Zealand to put all employees on individual contracts subject to the employer's discretion, and thereby get the work force in a condition which is relatively unprecedented in the modern industrial environment in this country . . . contracts give the employee no rights whatsoever except to their pay and when it comes.</PARA>
<PARA>CRA is one of the largest companies in Australia and one of the most profitable. We should be entitled to expect from it a sense of responsibility, a sense of leadership. Instead, in the Bell Bay case, evidence from the commission makes it clear that it intends to pervert the changes in labour legislation in this country in pursuit of ideology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What CRA is up to is very cynical and very sly. I know they are strong words, but I think the evidence from the commission and from CRA's public statements justifies those words. There is an indifference not only to the individual rights of workers but also to the wider interests of this country. In the past decade in this country we have built a better and more sustainable industrial reform framework. At a time of recession, the workers of Australia have made their share of sacrifices in real wage terms. In the eyes of CRA, none of that matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with CRA is that it sees collective bargaining as being incompatible with productivity growth and continuing organisational change. Even if that were true in New Zealand, it certainly is not true of many of the plants CRA operates in this country, where unions have led the way in workplace reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I fear from CRA's tactics is that the imposition of this foreign strategy will destroy the goodwill of the Australian work force in an environment where the threats to job security employed by CRA in New Zealand will not be effective. When a company as profitable as CRA is employing these tactics in the context of a strongly growing economy, we can only conclude that CRA is being reckless and playing a very dangerous industrial game with our industrial future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia we have a tripartite system of industrial relations based on standards recognised and used by the rest of the world. `Tripartite' means workers and employers, or their representatives, and the government working cooperatively to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes&mdash;that is, avoiding conflict and gaining productivity. In the last 10 years under the tripartite system conflict has been at an all time low. Hours lost through industrial disputes pale into insignificance when compared with the years of conflict and polarisation which made the Fraser federal government infamous. The tripartite system works. It has even worked under past conservative governments at various times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last example of a group choosing to step outside these tripartite arrangements in Australia was the airline pilots, who pursued substantial and unwarranted increases in their remuneration. I would compare plan X from CRA with what the pilots did. It is in the same vein: CRA is attempting to step outside the system. Australian society judged the pilots harshly, as I am certain they will CRA for its uncooperative and indulgent pursuits in industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even with new opportunities to improve efficiency and productivity through enterprise bargaining, CRA wants to destroy the system. We can only conclude that it is blindly following an ideology. And we know why. Because the New Zealand experience has given CRA a dream to pursue. CRA has not had to share its productivity gains with its work force. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Health Act requires that health funds be registered separately in each State in which they operate and this requirement has been in force since 1970. At the inception of these requirements, and since that time, most States have had a major fund which developed benefits for its local market. Benefit arrangements therefore evolved with State by State variations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was only after Medibank Private was established with national coverage that the market took on a more competitive nature as Medibank Private entered the market with different characteristics and products. Medibank Private had to develop products (including the benefits payable) which would enable it to compete with the then existing major Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) (i) For the names of services and treatments, not universally covered by Medibank Private, see the respective attachments for hospital and ancillary services.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(iii) Services and treatments are not covered in some States because Medibank Private has made a business decision on the range of benefits it will provide in the States concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(iv) This information is regarded by Medibank Private as commercially sensitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(v) This information is regarded by Medibank Private as commercially sensitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The Health Insurance Commission, trading as Medibank Private, is registered as a health benefits organisation in accordance with the provisions of the National Health Act, and operates a separate Medibank Private fund in each State. (The Northern Territory is included with the New South Wales fund.)  Medibank Private (as is the case with all registered health insurance funds) is therefore able to offer benefits for any treatment, service or appliance which falls within the meaning of `health insurance business' as defined in that Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) Each Medibank Private fund (and, indeed, all registered health insurance funds) regularly reviews the range and amounts of its benefits to reflect local market conditions.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No. Decisions about the level of Medicare Schedule fee increases, if any are taken by Government each year in the Budget context. In considering the extent of any fee increases the Government has regard for its Medical Fees Index, which includes components for the Consumer Price Index and Average Award Rates of Pay as well as prevailing economic conditions at the time, productivity increases in medical services and technology. There has been no change to this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The 1992/93 Budget introduced a detailed strategy to strengthen general practice. Part of this strategy included the establishment of local networks or `divisions' for general practitioners. These networks are now in place and are taking an active role in encouraging greater involvement on the part of general practitioners in health promotion and preventive health projects. Funding for these projects are application based and are assessed by committees having representation from the medical profession, consumer organisations and the Department.</PARA>

The agreement provided for the reimbursement amounts to be increased having regard to any increase in the number of pensioners and any movements in the Consumer Price Index. These amounts were based on the increased costs to the States/Territories of providing an agreed core group of concessions to the pensioners who became entitled to concessions because of the Commonwealth's decision to extend concessions to all part-rate pensioners.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The most recent data available, covering the period 1988-92, indicates that the suicide rate in Australia was highest among young rural males between the ages of 15 and 24 years, at a rate of 32.6 per 100,000 population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) I was not aware that five male youth suicides had occurred in a small town in southern Queensland since August 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) I appreciate that the severe drought in the eastern part of Australia is causing great hardship and affecting rural people in many ways. However, although it is recognised that many factors impact on the rates of suicide, as yet there is no established link between drought and suicide rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) I am particularly concerned about suicide rates among young people throughout Australia. Consequently, a number of initiatives which relate to suicide are being undertaken within my portfolio:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) established a working party in 1992 to develop a national strategy for suicide prevention. The first stage of public consultation has already elicited over 80 submissions. A second stage of consultation will be undertaken when the draft strategy has been completed. It is expected that the final document will be considered by the NHMRC in June 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NHMRC's Standing Committee on Quality of Health Care has established a working party to develop best practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of depression in adolescents.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has provided a significant boost to funding for mental health in the 1994-95 budget. An additional $168.7 million is being committed over four years for specific initiatives in mental health. Of this amount, $133.6 million will be used to enhance the National Mental Health Strategy. This increases the Commonwealth funds available to support the strategy to $250 million over the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Suicide prevention is being considered as one of the priority areas for the development of National Health Goals and Targets in Mental Health.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No. Following amendments to the Civil Aviation Regulations some time ago, a Helicopter Landing Site is no longer required to be approved by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concern in the Australian wool industry over sales of wool from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) into China, Turkey, Germany and now Italy and the US derives from the fact that it is being sold at low prices and thus competing with Australian wool. However, the nature of the wool produced within the CIS is generally of lower quality and yield due to the poorer conditions under which it is produced, notwithstanding longstanding access to Australian Merino rams. It is also unlikely that current sales can be sustained, given the decline in production within the CIS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While raw wool from the CIS is being blended with Australian raw wool to make tops, this is normal commercial practice in the wool textile industry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)(a) A small number of families will receive less assistance from Home Child Care Allowance than under the Dependent Spouse Rebate (DSR). It is not possible to state accurately how many families will receive less assistance. This is because the Australian Taxation Office does not request or record details of ages of children or income received by the Dependent Spouse, which is necessary to determine how many families will receive less assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Families will receive less assistance from Home Child Care Allowance than under the DSR in any one of the following situations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only dependent child for DSR purposes is between 18 years and 25 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dependent spouse has a low separate net income which has been reduced for taxation purposes by taking into account work related expenses directly chargeable against the earnings of that income, such as child care costs and travelling costs to and from work and child care. These expenses cannot be offset for Social Security purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Estranged spouses claim the DSR in respect of their former partner. Under the Home Child Care Allowance, claimants must be a member of a couple.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dependent spouse and/or children are temporarily absent from Australia for more than 13 weeks.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where there is shared care of children involved.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) (a) In this case, the family will be better off under the Home Child Care Allowance scheme than under the Dependent Spouse Rebate. The family will receive a cash payment on a fortnightly basis which will better reflect the current income circumstances of the partner who undertakes most of the care of the children, rather than the primary income earner receiving reduced taxation deductions on a fortnightly basis or a reduced liability at the end of the financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Based on the current rates of Home Child Care Allowance and the Dependent Spouse Rebate, the family will be better off by $89.50 per annum.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) (a) The Government has made this change to recognise the important contribution made by partners, usually women, who remain substantially out of the workforce to care for dependent children. Home Child Care Allowance provides an independent source of income for these partners while they remain out of the workforce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of families will be better off. These families include most of those who previously benefited from the Dependent Spouse Rebate, who will be about $5 per fortnight better off. Nearly 55 000 families with low taxable incomes who have been unable to obtain the full value of the Dependent Spouse Rebate will be, on average, $20 a week better off, and in some cases, $30 a week better off.   </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Home Child Care Allowance is also more responsive to the current circumstances of the family. For example, families where one partner stops work part way through the year to have a child will start to receive Home Child Care Allowance as soon as the baby is born.
